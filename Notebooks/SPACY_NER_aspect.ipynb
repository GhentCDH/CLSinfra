Using the EntityRuler, you can introduce some hard-coded rules into your system.\n","\n","The [GliNER model](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER) is fairly new at the time of writing - and allows you to ask the model to recognize domain-specific entities.

It runs\\nthus: \\\"The natural kindness, the high spirit, of the Florentine people,\\nthe wonderful masterpieces of art created by her great men, who in\\nevery age have stood in the front of art and science, rivalize with\\nthe gentle smile of her splendid sky to render Florence one of the\\nfinest towns of beautiful Italy\\\". These words, written, I feel sure,\\nby a Florentine, and therefore \\\"inspirated\\\" (as he says elsewhere) by\\na patriotic feeling, are true; and it is my hope that the pages that\\nfollow will at once fortify their truth and lead others to test it.\\n\\nLike the synthetical author, I too have not thought it necessary\\nto provide \\\"too many informations concerning art and history,\\\" but\\nthere will be found a few, practically unavoidable, in the gathering\\ntogether of which I have been indebted to many authors: notably Vasari,\\nSymonds, Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Ruskin, Pater, and Baedeker.

Let us do the same.\\n\\nThe real name of the Duomo is the Cathedral of S. Maria del Fiore, or\\nSt. Mary of the Flowers, the flower being the Florentine lily. Florence\\nherself is called the City of Flowers, and that, in the spring and\\nsummer, is a happy enough description. But in the winter it fails. A\\nname appropriate to all the seasons would be the City of the Miracle,\\nthe miracle being the Renaissance. For though all over Italy traces\\nof the miracle are apparent, Florence was its very home and still\\ncan point to the greatest number of its achievements. Giotto (at the\\nbeginning of this quickening movement) may at Assisi have been more\\ninspired as a painter; but here is his campanile and here are his\\nS. Maria Novella and S. Croce frescoes. Fra Angelico and Donatello\\n(in the midst of it) were never more inspired than here, where they\\nworked and died. Michelangelo (at the end of it) may be more surprising\\nin the Vatican; but here are his wonderful Medici tombs. How it came\\nabout that between the years 1300 and 1500 Italian soil -- and chiefly\\nTuscan soil -- threw up such masters, not only with the will and spirit\\nto do what they did but with the power too, no one will ever be able\\nto explain. But there it is. In the history of the world two centuries\\nwere suddenly given mysteriously to the activities of Italian men of\\nhumane genius and as suddenly the Divine gift was withdrawn. And to see\\nthe very flower of these two centuries it is to Florence we must go.\\n\\nIt is best to enter the Piazza del Duomo from the Via de' Martelli,\\nthe Via de' Cerretani, the Via Calzaioli, or the Via Pecori, because\\nthen one comes instantly upon the campanile too. The upper windows -- so\\nvery lovely -- may have been visible at the end of the streets, with\\nBrunelleschi's warm dome high in the sky beside them, but that was\\nnot to diminish the effect of the first sight of the whole. Duomo and\\ncampanile make as fair a couple as ever builders brought together: the\\nimmense comfortable church so solidly set upon the earth, and at its\\nside this delicate, slender marble creature, all gaiety and lightness,\\nwhich as surely springs from roots within the earth. For one cannot\\nbe long in Florence, looking at this tower every day and many times a\\nday, both from near and far, without being perfectly certain that it\\ngrows -- and from a bulb, I think -- and was never really built at all,\\nwhatever the records may aver.\\n\\nThe interior of the Duomo is so unexpected that one has the\\nfeeling of having entered, by some extraordinary chance, the wrong\\nbuilding. Outside it was so garish with its coloured marbles, under\\nthe southern sky; outside, too, one's ears were filled with all the\\nshattering noises in which Florence is an adept; and then, one step,\\nand behold nothing but vast and silent gloom. This surprise is the more\\nemphatic if one happens already to have been in the Baptistery. For the\\nBaptistery is also coloured marble without, yet within it is coloured\\nmarble and mosaic too: there is no disparity; whereas in the Duomo\\nthe walls have a Northern grey and the columns are brown. Austerity\\nand immensity join forces.\\n\\nWhen all is said the chief merit of the Duomo is this immensity. Such\\nworks of art as it has are not very noticeable, or at any rate do\\nnot insist upon being seen; but in its vastness it overpowers. Great\\nas are some of the churches of Florence, I suppose three or four of\\nthem could be packed within this one. And mere size with a dim light\\nand a savour of incense is enough: it carries religion. No need for\\nmasses and chants or any ceremony whatever: the world is shut out,\\none is on terms with the infinite. A forest exercises the same spell;\\namong mountains one feels it; but in such a cathedral as the Duomo one\\nfeels it perhaps most of all, for it is the work of man, yet touched\\nwith mystery and wonder, and the knowledge that man is the author of\\nsuch a marvel adds to its greatness.\\n\\nThe interior is so dim and strange as to be for a time sheer terra\\nincognita, and to see a bat flitting from side to side, as I have\\noften done even in the morning, is to receive no shock. In such a\\ntwilight land there must naturally be bats, one thinks. The darkness\\nis due not to lack of windows but to time. The windows are there,\\nbut they have become opaque. None of the coloured ones in the aisle\\nallows more than a filtration of light through it; there are only the\\nplain, circular ones high up and those rich, coloured, circular ones\\nunder the dome to do the work. In a little while, however, one's eyes\\nnot only become accustomed to the twilight but are very grateful for\\nit; and beginning to look inquiringly about, as they ever do in this\\ncity of beauty, they observe, just inside, an instant reminder of the\\nantiseptic qualities of Italy. For by the first great pillar stands a\\nreceptacle for holy water, with a pretty and charming angelic figure\\nupon it, which from its air of newness you would think was a recent\\ngift to the cathedral by a grateful Florentine. It is six hundred\\nyears old and perhaps was designed by Giotto himself.\\n\\nThe emptiness of the Duomo is another of its charms. Nothing is allowed\\nto impair the vista as you stand by the western entrance: the floor\\nhas no chairs; the great columns rise from it in the gloom as if they,\\ntoo, were rooted. The walls, too, are bare, save for a few tablets.\\n\\nThe history of the building is briefly this. The first cathedral of\\nFlorence was the Baptistery, and S. John the Baptist is still the\\npatron saint of the city. Then in 1182 the cathedral was transferred\\nto S. Reparata, which stood on part of the site of the Duomo, and in\\n1294 the decision to rebuild S. Reparata magnificently was arrived\\nat, and Arnolfo di Cambio was instructed to draw up plans. Arnolfo,\\nwhom we see not only on a tablet in the left aisle, in relief, with\\nhis plan, but also more than life size, seated beside Brunelleschi\\non the Palazzo de' Canonici on the south side of the cathedral,\\nfacing the door, was then sixty-two and an architect of great\\nreputation. Born in 1232, he had studied under Niccolo Pisano, the\\nsculptor of the famous pulpit at Pisa (now in the museum there),\\nof that in the cathedral in Siena, and of the fountain at Perugia\\n(in all of which Arnolfo probably helped), and the designer of many\\nbuildings all over Italy. Arnolfo's own unaided sculpture may be seen\\nat its best in the ciborium in S. Paolo Fuori le Mura in Rome; but\\nit is chiefly as an architect that he is now known. He had already\\ngiven Florence her extended walls and some of her most beautiful\\nbuildings -- the Or San Michele and the Badia -- and simultaneously he\\ndesigned S. Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio. Vasari has it that Arnolfo\\nwas assisted on the Duomo by Cimabue; but that is doubtful.\\n\\nThe foundations were consecrated in 1296 and the first stone laid\\non September 8th, 1298, and no one was more interested in its early\\nprogress than a young, grave lawyer who used to sit on a stone seat\\non the south side and watch the builders, little thinking how soon\\nhe was to be driven from Florence for ever. This seat -- the Sasso di\\nDante -- was still to be seen when Wordsworth visited Florence in 1837,\\nfor he wrote a sonnet in which he tells us that he in reverence sate\\nthere too, \\\"and, for a moment, filled that empty Throne\\\". But one\\ncan do so no longer, for the place which it occupied has been built\\nover and only a slab in the wall with an inscription (on the house\\nnext the Palazzo de' Canonici) marks the site.\\n\\nArnolfo died in 1310, and thereupon there seems to have been a\\ncessation or slackening of work, due no doubt to the disturbed\\nstate of the city, which was in the throes of costly wars and\\nembroilments. Not until 1332 is there definite news of its progress,\\nby which time the work had passed into the control of the Arte della\\nLana; but in that year, although Florentine affairs were by no means\\nas flourishing as they should be, and a flood in the Arno had just\\ndestroyed three or four of the bridges, a new architect was appointed,\\nin the person of the most various and creative man in the history\\nof the Renaissance -- none other than Giotto himself, who had already\\nreceived the commission to design the campanile which should stand\\nat the cathedral's side.\\n\\nGiotto was the son of a small farmer at Vespignano, near Florence. He\\nwas instructed in art by Cimabue, who discovered him drawing a lamb\\non a stone while herding sheep, and took him as his pupil. Cimabue,\\nof whom more is said, together with more of Giotto as a painter, in the\\nchapter on the Accademia, had died in 1302, leaving Giotto far beyond\\nall living artists, and Giotto, between the age of fifty and sixty, was\\nnow residing in Cimabue's house. He had already painted frescoes in the\\nBargello (introducing his friend Dante), in S. Maria Novella, S. Croce,\\nand elsewhere in Italy, particularly in the upper and lower churches\\nat Assisi, and at the Madonna dell' Arena chapel at Padua when Dante\\nwas staying there during his exile. In those days no man was painter\\nonly or architect only; an all-round knowledge of both arts and crafts\\nwas desired by every ambitious youth who was attracted by the wish to\\nmake beautiful things, and Giotto was a universal master. It was not\\nthen surprising that on his settling finally in Florence he should be\\ninvited to design a campanile to stand for ever beside the cathedral,\\nor that he should be appointed superintendent of the cathedral works.\\n\\nGiotto did not live to see even his tower completed -- it is the unhappy\\ndestiny of architects to die too soon -- but he was able during the\\nfour years left him to find time for certain accessory decorations,\\nof which more will be said later, and also to paint for S. Trinit\\u00e0\\nthe picture which we shall see in the Accademia, together with a few\\nother works, since perished, for the Badia and S. Giorgio. He died in\\n1336 and was buried in the cathedral, as the tablet, with Benedetto\\nda Maiano's bust of him, tells. He is also to be seen full length,\\nin stone, in a niche at the Uffizi; but the figure is misleading,\\nfor if Vasari is to be trusted (and for my part I find it amusing to\\ntrust him as much as possible) the master was insignificant in size.\\n\\nGiotto has suffered, I think, in reputation, from Ruskin, who took\\nhim peculiarly under his wing, persistently called him \\\"the Shepherd,\\\"\\nand made him appear as something between a Sunday-school superintendent\\nand the Creator. The \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" and \\\"Giotto and his Works\\nin Padua\\\" so insist upon the artist's holiness and conscious purpose\\nin all he did that his genial worldliness, shrewdness, and humour, as\\nbrought out by Dante, Vasari, Sacchetti, and Boccaccio, are utterly\\nexcluded. What we see is an intense saint where really was a very\\nrobust man. Sacchetti's story of Giotto one day stumbling over a\\npig that ran between his legs and remarking, \\\"And serve me right;\\nfor I've made thousands with the help of pigs' bristles and never\\nonce given them even a cup of broth,\\\" helps to adjust the balance;\\nwhile to his friend Dante he made a reply, so witty that the poet\\ncould not forget his admiration, in answer to his question how was\\nit that Giotto's pictures were so beautiful and his six children so\\nugly; but I must leave the reader to hunt it for himself, as these\\nare modest pages. Better still, for its dry humour, was his answer\\nto King Robert of Naples, who had commanded him to that city to paint\\nsome Scriptural scenes, and, visiting the artist while he worked, on\\na very hot day, remarked, \\\"Giotto, if I were you I should leave off\\npainting for a while\\\". \\\"Yes,\\\" replied Giotto, \\\"if I were you I should.\\\"\\n\\nTo Giotto happily we come again and again in this book. Enough at\\npresent to say that upon his death in 1336 he was buried, like Arnolfo,\\nin the cathedral, where the tablet to his memory may be studied,\\nand was succeeded as architect, both of the church and the tower,\\nby his friend and assistant, Andrea Pisano, whose chief title to\\nfame is his Baptistery doors and the carving, which we are soon to\\nexamine, of the scenes round the base of the campanile. He, too,\\ndied -- in 1348 -- before the tower was finished.\\n\\nFrancesco Talenti was next called in, again to superintend both\\nbuildings, and not only to superintend but to extend the plans of the\\ncathedral. Arnolfo and Giotto had both worked upon a smaller scale;\\nTalenti determined the present floor dimensions. The revised fa\\u00e7ade\\nwas the work of a committee of artists, among them Giotto's godson\\nand disciple, Taddeo Gaddi, then busy with the Ponte Vecchio, and\\nAndrea Orcagna, whose tabernacle we shall see at Or San Michele. And\\nso the work went on until the main structure was complete in the\\nthirteen-seventies.\\n\\nAnother longish interval then came, in which nothing of note in the\\nconstruction occurred, and the next interesting date is 1418, when a\\ncompetition for the design for the dome was announced, the work to\\nbe given eventually to one Filippo Brunelleschi, then an ambitious\\nand nervously determined man, well known in Florence as an architect,\\nof forty-one. Brunelleschi, who, again according to Vasari, was small,\\nand therefore as different as may be from the figure which is seated\\non the clergy house opposite the south door of the cathedral, watching\\nhis handiwork, was born in 1377, the son of a well-to-do Florentine of\\ngood family who wished to make him a notary. The boy, however, wanted\\nto be an artist, and was therefore placed with a goldsmith, which was\\nin those days the natural course. As a youth he attempted everything,\\nbeing of a pertinacious and inquiring mind, and he was also a great\\ndebater and student of Dante; and, taking to sculpture, he was one\\nof those who, as we shall see in a later chapter, competed for the\\ncommission for the Baptistery gates. It was indeed his failure in that\\ncompetition which decided him to concentrate on architecture. That\\nhe was a fine sculptor his competitive design, now preserved in the\\nBargello, and his Christ crucified in S. Maria Novella, prove; but\\nin leading him to architecture the stars undoubtedly did rightly.\\n\\nIt was in 1403 that the decision giving Ghiberti the Baptistery\\ncommission was made, when Brunelleschi was twenty-six and Donatello,\\ndestined to be his life-long friend, was seventeen; and when\\nBrunelleschi decided to go to Rome for the study of his new branch of\\nindustry, architecture, Donatello went too. There they worked together,\\ncopying and measuring everything of beauty, Brunelleschi having always\\nbefore his mind the problem of how to place a dome upon the cathedral\\nof his native city. But, having a shrewd knowledge of human nature\\nand immense patience, he did not hasten to urge upon the authorities\\nhis claims as the heaven-born architect, but contented himself with\\nsmaller works, and even assisted his rival Ghiberti with his gates,\\njoining at that task Donatello and Luca della Robbia, and giving\\nlessons in perspective to a youth who was to do more than any man\\nafter Giotto to assure the great days of painting and become the\\nexemplar of the finest masters -- Masaccio.\\n\\nIt was not until 1419 that Brunelleschi's persistence and belief\\nin his own powers satisfied the controllers of the cathedral works\\nthat he might perhaps be as good as his word and was the right man\\nto build the dome; but at last he was able to begin. For the\\nstory of his difficulties, told minutely and probably with sufficient\\naccuracy, one must go to Vasari: it is well worth reading, and is a\\nlurid commentary on the suspicions and jealousies of the world. The\\nbuilding of the dome, without scaffolding, occupied fourteen years,\\nBrunelleschi's device embracing two domes, one within the other,\\ntied together with stone for material support and strength. It is\\nbecause of this inner dome that the impression of its size, from\\nwithin the cathedral, can disappoint. Meanwhile, in spite of all the\\nwear and tear of the work, the satisfying of incredulous busy-bodies,\\nand the removal of such an incubus as Ghiberti, who because he was a\\nsuperb modeller of bronze reliefs was made for a while joint architect\\nwith a salary that Brunelleschi felt should either be his own or no\\none's, the little man found time also to build beautiful churches\\nand cloisters all over Florence. He lived to see his dome finished\\nand the cathedral consecrated by Pope Eugenius IV in 1436, dying ten\\nyears later. He was buried in the cathedral, and his adopted son and\\npupil, Buggiano, made the head of him on the tablet to his memory.\\n\\nBrunelleschi's lantern, the model of which from his own hand we shall\\nsee in the museum of the cathedral, was not placed on the dome until\\n1462. The copper ball above it was the work of Verrocchio. In 1912\\nthere are still wanting many yards of stone border to the dome.\\n\\nOf the man himself we know little, except that he was of iron\\ntenacity and lived for his work. Vasari calls him witty, but gives\\na not good example of his wit; he seems to have been philanthropic\\nand a patron of poor artists, and he grieved deeply at the untimely\\ndeath of Masaccio, who painted him in one of the Carmine frescoes,\\ntogether with Donatello and other Florentines.\\n\\nAs one walks about Florence, visiting this church and that, and\\npeering into cool cloisters, one's mind is always intent upon the\\nsculpture or paintings that may be preserved there for the delectation\\nof the eye. The tendency is to think little of the architect who made\\nthe buildings where they are treasured. Asked to name the greatest\\nmakers of this beautiful Florence, the ordinary visitor would\\nsay Michelangelo, Giotto, Raphael, Donatello, the della Robbias,\\nGhirlandaio, and Andrea del Sarto: all before Brunelleschi, even if\\nhe named him at all. But this is wrong. Not even Michelangelo did\\nso much for Florence as he. Michelangelo was no doubt the greatest\\nindividualist in the whole history of art, and everything that he did\\ngrips the memory in a vice; but Florence without Michelangelo would\\nstill be very nearly Florence, whereas Florence without Brunelleschi\\nis unthinkable. No dome to the cathedral, first of all; no S. Lorenzo\\nchurch or cloisters; no S. Croce cloisters or Pazzi chapel; no Badia\\nof Fiesole. Honour where honour is due. We should be singing the\\npraises of Filippo Brunelleschi in every quarter of the city.\\n\\nAfter Brunelleschi the chief architect of the cathedral was Giuliano da\\nMaiano, the artist of the beautiful intarsia woodwork in the sacristy,\\nand the uncle of Benedetto da Maiano who made the S. Croce pulpit.\\n\\nThe present fa\\u00e7ade is the work of the architect Emilio de Fabris,\\nwhose tablet is to be seen on the left wall. It was finished in 1887,\\nfive hundred and more years after the abandonment of Arnolfo's original\\ndesign and three hundred and more years after the destruction of the\\nsecond one, begun in 1357 and demolished in 1587. Of Arnolfo's fa\\u00e7ade\\nthe primitive seated statue of Boniface VIII (or John XXII) just inside\\nthe cathedral is, with a bishop in one of the sacristies, the only\\nremnant; while of the second fa\\u00e7ade, for which Donatello and other\\nearly Renaissance sculptors worked, the giant S. John the Evangelist,\\nin the left aisle, is perhaps the most important relic. Other statues\\nin the cathedral were also there, while the central figure -- the Madonna\\nwith enamel eyes -- may be seen in the cathedral museum. Although not\\ngreat, the group of the Madonna and Child now over the central door\\nof the Duomo has much charm and benignancy.\\n\\nThe present fa\\u00e7ade, although attractive as a mass of light, is not\\nreally good. Its patterns are trivial, its paintings and statues\\ncommonplace; and I personally have the feeling that it would have\\nbeen more fitting had Giotto's marble been supplied rather with\\na contrast than an imitation. As it is, it is not till Giotto's\\ntower soars above the fa\\u00e7ade that one can rightly (from the front)\\nappreciate its roseate delicacy, so strong is this rival.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nThe Duomo II: Its Associations\\n\\nDante's picture -- Sir John Hawkwood -- Ancestor and Descendant -- The Pazzi\\nConspiracy -- Squeamish Montesecco -- Giuliano de' Medici dies -- Lorenzo's\\nescape -- Vengeance on the Pazzi -- Botticelli's cartoon -- High\\nMass -- Luca della Robbia -- Michelangelo nearing the end -- The Miracles\\nof Zenobius -- East and West meet in splendour -- Marsilio Ficino and\\nthe New Learning -- Beautiful glass.\\n\\nOf the four men most concerned in the structure of the Duomo I have\\nalready spoken. There are other men held in memory there, and certain\\npaintings and statues, of which I wish to speak now.\\n\\nThe picture of Dante in the left aisle was painted by command of\\nthe Republic in 1465, one hundred and sixty-three years after his\\nbanishment from the city. Lectures on Dante were frequently delivered\\nin the churches of Florence during the fourteenth and fifteenth\\ncenturies, and it was interesting for those attending them to have\\na portrait on the wall. This picture was painted by Domenico di\\nMichelino, the portrait of Dante being prepared for him by Alessio\\nBaldovinetti, who probably took it from Giotto's fresco in the chapel\\nof the Podest\\u00e1 at the Bargello. In this picture Dante stands between\\nthe Inferno and a concentrated Florence in which portions of the\\nDuomo, the Signoria, the Badia, the Bargello, and Or San Michele are\\nvisible. Behind him is Paradise. In his hand is the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\". I\\nsay no more of the poet here, because a large part of the chapter on\\nthe Badia is given to him.\\n\\nNear the Dante picture in the left aisle are two Donatellos -- the\\nmassive S. John the Evangelist, seated, who might have given ideas\\nto Michelangelo for his Moses a century and more later; and, nearer\\nthe door, between the tablets to De Fabris and Squarciaparello, the\\nso-called Poggio Bracciolini, a witty Italian statesman and Humanist\\nand friend of the Medici, who, however, since he was much younger than\\nthis figure at the time of its exhibition, and is not known to have\\nvisited Florence till later, probably did not sit for it. But it is\\na powerful and very natural work, although its author never intended\\nit to stand on any floor, even of so dim a cathedral as this. The\\nS. John, I may say, was brought from the old fa\\u00e7ade -- not Arnolfo's,\\nbut the committee's fa\\u00e7ade -- where it had a niche about ten feet from\\nthe ground. The Poggio was also on this fa\\u00e7ade, but higher. It was\\nPoggio's son, Jacopo, who took part in the Pazzi Conspiracy, of which\\nwe are about to read, and was very properly hanged for it.\\n\\nOf the two pictures on the entrance wall, so high as to be imperfectly\\nseen, that on the right as you face it has peculiar interest to\\nEnglish visitors, for (painted by Paolo Uccello, whose great battle\\npiece enriches our National Gallery) it represents Sir John Hawkwood,\\nan English free-lance and head of the famous White Company, who\\nafter some successful raids on Papal territory in Provence, put his\\nsword, his military genius, and his bravoes at the service of the\\nhighest bidder among the warlike cities and provinces of Italy, and,\\neventually passing wholly into the employment of Florence (after\\nharrying her for other pay-masters for some years), delivered her\\nvery signally from her enemies in 1392. Hawkwood was an Essex man,\\nthe son of a tanner at Hinckford, and was born there early in the\\nfourteenth century. He seems to have reached France as an archer under\\nEdward III, and to have remained a free-booter, passing on to Italy,\\nabout 1362, to engage joyously in as much fighting as any English\\ncommander can ever have had, for some thirty years, with very good\\npay for it. Although, by all accounts, a very Salomon Brazenhead,\\nHawkwood had enough dignity to be appointed English Ambassador to Rome,\\nand later to Florence, which he made his home, and where he died in\\n1394. He was buried in the Duomo, on the north side of the choir, and\\nwas to have reposed beneath a sumptuous monument made under his own\\ninstructions, with frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi and Giuliano d'Arrigo;\\nbut something intervened, and Uccello's fresco was used instead,\\nand this, some sixty years ago, was transferred to canvas and moved\\nto the position in which it now is seen.\\n\\nHawkwood's life, briskly told by a full-blooded hand, would make a fine\\nbook. One pleasant story at least is related of him, that on being\\nbeset by some begging friars who prefaced their mendicancy with the\\nwords, \\\"God give you peace,\\\" he answered, \\\"God take away your alms\\\";\\nand, on their protesting, reminded them that such peace was the last\\nthing he required, since should their pious wish come true he would\\ndie of hunger. One of the daughters of this fire-eater married John\\nShelley, and thus became an ancestress of Shelley the poet, who,\\nas it chances, also found a home for a while in this city, almost\\nwithin hailing distance of his ancestor's tomb and portrait, and here\\nwrote not only his \\\"Ode to the West Wind,\\\" but his caustic satire,\\n\\\"Peter Bell the Third\\\".\\n\\nHawkwood's name is steeped sufficiently in carnage; but we get to the\\nscene of bloodshed in reality as we approach the choir, for it was\\nhere that Giuliano de' Medici was assassinated, as he attended High\\nMass, on April 26th, 1478, with the connivance, if not actually at the\\ninstigation, of Christ's Vicar himself, Pope Sixtus IV. Florentine\\nhistory is so eventful and so tortuous that beyond the bare outline\\ngiven in chapter V, I shall make in these pages but little effort to\\nfollow it, assuming a certain amount of knowledge on the part of the\\nreader; but it must be stated here that periodical revolts against\\nthe power and prestige of the Medici often occurred, and none was\\nmore desperate than that of the Pazzi family in 1478, acting with\\nthe support of the Pope behind all and with the co-operation of\\nGirolamo Riario, nephew of the Pope, and Salviati, Archbishop of\\nPisa. The Pazzi, who were not only opposed to the temporal power\\nof the Medici, but were their rivals in business -- both families\\nbeing bankers -- wished to rid Florence of Lorenzo and Giuliano in\\norder to be greater both civically and financially. Girolamo wished\\nthe removal of Lorenzo and Giuliano in order that hostility to his\\nplans for adding Forli and Faenza to the territory of Imola, which\\nthe Pope had successfully won for him against Lorenzo's opposition,\\nmight disappear. The Pope had various political reasons for wishing\\nLorenzo's and Giuliano's death and bringing Florence, always headstrong\\nand dangerous, to heel. While as for Salviati, it was sufficient that\\nhe was Archbishop of Pisa, Florence's ancient rival and foe; but he\\nwas a thoroughly bad lot anyway. Assassination also was in the air,\\nfor Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan had been stabbed in church in 1476,\\nthus to some extent paving the way for this murder, since Lorenzo\\nand Sforza, when acting together, had been practically unassailable.\\n\\nIn 1478 Lorenzo was twenty-nine, Giuliano twenty-five. Lorenzo had\\nbeen at the head of Florentine affairs for nine years and he was\\nsteadily growing in strength and popularity. Hence it was now or never.\\n\\nThe conspirators' first idea was to kill the brothers at a banquet\\nwhich Lorenzo was to give to the great-nephew of the Pope, the\\nyouthful Cardinal Raffaello Riario, who promised to be an amenable\\ncatspaw. Giuliano, however, having hurt his leg, was not well enough to\\nbe present, but as he would attend High Mass, the conspirators decided\\nto act then. That is to say, it was then, in the cathedral, that the\\ndeath of the Medici brothers was to be effected; meanwhile another\\ndetachment of conspirators under Salviati was to rise simultaneously to\\ncapture the Signoria, while the armed men of the party who were outside\\nand inside the walls would begin their attacks on the populace. Thus,\\nat the same moment Medici and city would fall. Such was the plan.\\n\\nThe actual assassins were Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini,\\nwho were nominally friends of the Medici (Francesco's brother Guglielmo\\nhaving married Bianca de' Medici, Lorenzo's sister), and two priests\\nnamed Maffeo da Volterra and Stefano da Bagnone. A professional bravo\\nnamed Montesecco was to have killed Lorenzo, but refused on learning\\nthat the scene of the murder was to be a church. At that, he said,\\nhe drew the line: murder anywhere else he could perform cheerfully,\\nbut in a sacred building it was too much to ask. He therefore did\\nnothing, but, subsequently confessing, made the guilt of all his\\nassociates doubly certain.\\n\\nWhen High Mass began it was found that Giuliano was not present,\\nand Francesco de' Pazzi and Bandini were sent to persuade him to\\ncome -- a Judas-like errand indeed. On the way back, it is said, one\\nof them affectionately placed his arm round Giuliano -- to see if he\\nwore a shirt of mail -- remarking, to cover the action, that he was\\ngetting fat. On his arrival, Giuliano took his place at the north\\nside of the circular choir, near the door which leads to the Via de'\\nServi, while Lorenzo stood at the opposite side. At the given signal\\nBandini and Pazzi were to stab Giuliano and the two priests were to\\nstab Lorenzo. The signal was the breaking of the Eucharistic wafer,\\nand at this solemn moment Giuliano was instantly killed, with one stab\\nin the heart and nineteen elsewhere, Francesco so overdoing his attack\\nthat he severely wounded himself too; but Lorenzo was in time to see\\nthe beginning of the assault, and, making a movement to escape, he\\nprevented the priest from doing aught but inflict a gash in his neck,\\nand, springing away, dashed behind the altar to the old sacristy,\\nwhere certain of his friends who followed him banged the heavy bronze\\ndoors on the pursuing foe. Those in the cathedral, mean-while, were in\\na state of hysterical alarm; the youthful cardinal was hurried into\\nthe new sacristy; Guglielmo de' Pazzi bellowed forth his innocence\\nin loud tones; and his murderous brother and Bandini got off.\\n\\nOrder being restored, Lorenzo was led by a strong bodyguard to\\nthe Palazzo Medici, where he appeared at a window to convince the\\nmomentarily increasing crowd that he was still living. Meanwhile\\nthings were going not much more satisfactorily for the Pazzi at\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio, where, according to the plan, the gonfalonier,\\nCesare Petrucci, was to be either killed or secured. The Archbishop\\nSalviati, who was to effect this, managed his interview so clumsily\\nthat Petrucci suspected something, those being suspicious times,\\nand, instead of submitting to capture, himself turned the key on his\\nvisitors. The Pazzi faction in the city, meanwhile, hoping that all\\nhad gone well in the Palazzo Vecchio, as well as in the cathedral\\n(as they thought), were running through the streets calling \\\"Viva la\\nLibert\\u00e0!\\\" to be met with counter cries of \\\"Palle! palle!\\\" -- the palle\\nbeing the balls on the Medici escutcheon, still to be seen all over\\nFlorence and its vicinity and on every curtain in the Uffizi.\\n\\nThe truth gradually spreading, the city then rose for the Medici and\\njustice began to be done. The Archbishop was handed at once, just as\\nhe was, from a window of the Palazzo Vecchio. Francesco de' Pazzi,\\nwho had got home to bed, was dragged to the Palazzo and hanged too. The\\nmob meanwhile were not idle, and most of the Pazzi were accounted for,\\ntogether with many followers -- although Lorenzo publicly implored them\\nto be merciful. Poliziano, the scholar-poet and friend of Lorenzo,\\nhas left a vivid account of the day. With his own eyes he saw the\\nhanging Salviati, in his last throes, bite the hanging Francesco de\\nPazzi. Old Jacopo succeeded in escaping, but not for long, and a day\\nor so later he too was hanged. Bandini got as far as Constantinople,\\nbut was brought back in chains and hanged. The two priests hid in\\nthe Benedictine abbey in the city and for a while evaded search,\\nbut being found they were torn to pieces by the crowd. Montesecco,\\nhaving confessed, was beheaded in the courtyard of the Bargello.\\n\\nThe hanging of the chief conspirators was kept in the minds of the\\nshort-memoried Florentines by a representation outside the Palazzo\\nVecchio, by none other than the wistful, spiritual Botticelli; while\\nthree effigies, life size, of Lorenzo -- one of them with his bandaged\\nneck -- were made by Verrocchio in coloured wax and set up in places\\nwhere prayers might be offered. Commemorative medals which may be\\nseen in the Bargello, were also struck, and the family of Pazzi was\\nbanished and its name removed by decree from the city's archives. Poor\\nGiuliano, who was generally beloved for his charm and youthful spirits,\\nwas buried at S. Lorenzo in great state.\\n\\nI have often attended High Mass in this Duomo choir -- the theatre of\\nthe Pazzi tragedy -- but never without thinking of that scene.\\n\\nLuca della Robbia's doors to the new sacristy, which gave the young\\ncardinal his safety, had been finished only eleven years. Donatello was\\nto have designed them, but his work at Padua was too pressing. The\\ncommission was then given to Michelozzo, Donatello's partner,\\nand to Luca della Robbia, but it seems likely that Luca did nearly\\nall. The doors are in very high relief, thus differing absolutely\\nfrom Donatello's at S. Lorenzo, which are in very low. Luca's work\\nhere is sweet and mild rather than strong, and the panels derive\\ntheir principal charm from the angels, who, in pairs, attend the\\nsaints. Above the door was placed, at the time of Lorenzo's escape,\\nthe beautiful cantoria, also by Luca, which is now in the museum of\\nthe cathedral, while above the door of the old sacristy was Donatello's\\ncantoria. Commonplace new ones now take their place. In the semicircle\\nover each door is a coloured relief by Luca: that over the bronze doors\\nbeing the \\\"Resurrection,\\\" and the other the \\\"Ascension\\\"; and they are\\ninteresting not only for their beauty but as being the earliest-known\\nexamples in Luca's newly-discovered glazed terra-cotta medium,\\nwhich was to do so much in the hands of himself, his nephew Andrea,\\nand his followers, to make Florence still lovelier and the legend\\nof the Virgin Mary still sweeter. But of the della Robbias and their\\nexquisite genius I shall say more later, when we come to the Bargello.\\n\\nAs different as would be possible to imagine is the genius of that\\nyounger sculptor, the author of the Piet\\u00e0 at the back of the altar,\\nnear where we now stand, who, when Luca finished these bronze doors,\\nin 1467, was not yet born -- Michelangelo Buonarroti. This group, which\\nis unfinished, is the last the old and weary Titan ever worked at,\\nand it was meant to be part of his own tomb. Vasari, to whose \\\"Lives\\nof the Painters\\\" we shall be indebted, as this book proceeds, for so\\nmuch good human nature, and who speaks of Michelangelo with peculiar\\nauthority, since he was his friend, pupil, and correspondent, tells us\\nthat once when he went to see the sculptor in Rome, near the end, he\\nfound him at work upon this Piet\\u00e0, but the sculptor was so dissatisfied\\nwith one portion that he let his lantern fall in order that Vasari\\nmight not see it, saying: \\\"I am so old that death frequently drags\\nat my mantle to take me, and one day my person will fall like this\\nlantern\\\". The Piet\\u00e0 is still in deep gloom, as the master would have\\nliked, but enough is revealed to prove its pathos and its power.\\n\\nIn the east end of the nave is the chapel of S. Zenobius, containing a\\nbronze reliquary by Ghiberti, with scenes upon it from the life of this\\nsaint, so important in Florentine religious history. It is, however,\\nvery hard to see, and should be illuminated. Zenobius was born at\\nFlorence in the reign of Constantine the Great, when Christianity\\nwas by no means the prevailing religion of the city, although the\\nway had been paved by various martyrs. After studying philosophy\\nand preaching with much acceptance, Zenobius was summoned to Rome\\nby Pope Damasus. On the Pope's death he became Bishop of Florence,\\nand did much, says Butler, to \\\"extirpate the kingdom of Satan\\\". The\\nsaint lived in the ancient tower which still stands -- one of the few\\nsurvivors of Florence's hundreds of towers -- at the corner of the Via\\nPor S. Maria (which leads from the Mercato Nuovo to the Ponte Vecchio)\\nand the Via Lambertesca. It is called the Torre de' Girolami, and\\non S. Zenobius' day -- May 25th -- is decorated with flowers; and since\\nnever are so many flowers in the city of flowers as at that time, it\\nis a sight to see. The remains of the saint were moved to the Duomo,\\nalthough it had not then its dome, from S. Lorenzo, in 1330, and the\\nsimple column in the centre of the road opposite Ghiberti's first\\nBaptistery doors was erected to mark the event, since on that very\\nspot, it is said, stood a dead elm tree which, when the bier of the\\nsaint chanced to touch it, immediately sprang to life again and burst\\ninto leaf; even, the enthusiastic chronicler adds, into flower. The\\nresult was that the tree was cut completely to pieces by relic hunters,\\nbut the column by the Baptistery, the work of Brunelleschi (erected on\\nthe site of an earlier one), fortunately remains as evidence of the\\nmiracle. Ghiberti, however, did not choose this miracle but another\\nfor representation; for not only did Zenobius dead restore animation,\\nbut while he was himself living he resuscitated two boys. The one was a\\nward of his own; the second was an ordinary Florentine, for whom the\\nsame modest boon was craved by his sorrowing parents. It is one of\\nthese scenes of resuscitation which Ghiberti has designed in bronze,\\nwhile Ridolfo Ghirlandaio painted it in a picture in the Uffizi. We\\nshall see S. Zenobius again in the fresco by Ridolfo's father, the\\ngreat Ghirlandaio, in the Palazzo Vecchio; while the portrait on the\\nfirst pillar of the left aisle, as one enters the cathedral is of\\nZenobius too.\\n\\nThe date of the Pazzi Conspiracy was 1478. A few years later the\\nsame building witnessed the extraordinary effects of Savonarola's\\noratory, when such was the terrible picture he drew of the fate of\\nunregenerate sinners that his listeners' hair was said actually to\\nrise with fright. Savonarola came towards the end of the Renaissance,\\nto give it its death-blow. By contrast there is a tablet on the right\\nwall of the cathedral in honour of one who did much to bring about the\\npaganism and sophistication against which the impassioned reformer\\nuttered his fiercest denunciations: Marsilio Ficino (1433-1491),\\nthe neo-Platonist proteg\\u00e9 of Cosimo de' Medici, and friend both\\nof Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo. To explain Marsilio's influence\\nit is necessary to recede a little into history. In 1439 Cosimo de'\\nMedici succeeded in transferring the scene of the Great Council of the\\nChurch to Florence. At this conference representatives of the Western\\nChurch, centred in Rome, met those of the Eastern Church, centred\\nin Constantinople, which was still Christian, for the purpose of\\ndiscussing various matters, not the least of which was the protection\\nof the Eastern Church against the Infidel. Not only was Constantinople\\ncontinually threatened by the Turks, and in need of arms as well\\nas sympathy, but the two branches of the Church were at enmity over\\na number of points. It was as much to heal these differences as to\\nseek temporal aid that the Emperor John Palaeologus, the Patriarch\\nof Constantinople, and a vast concourse of nobles, priests, and\\nGreek scholars, arrived in Italy, and, after sojourning at Venice\\nand Ferrara, moved on to Florence at the invitation of Cosimo. The\\nEmperor resided in the Peruzzi palace, now no more, near S. Croce;\\nthe Patriarch of Constantinople lodged (and as it chanced, died, for\\nhe was very old) at the Ferrantini palace, now the Casa Vernaccia,\\nin the Borgo Pinti; while Pope Eugenius was at the convent attached\\nto S. Maria Novella. The meetings of the Council were held where we\\nnow stand -- in the cathedral, whose dome had just been placed upon it\\nall ready for them.\\n\\nThe Council failed in its purpose, and, as we know, Constantinople\\nwas lost some years later, and the great empire of which John\\nPalaeologus was the last ruler ceased to be. That, however, at the\\nmoment is beside the mark. The interesting thing to us is that among\\nthe scholars who came from Constantinople, bringing with them numbers\\nof manuscripts and systems of thought wholly new to the Florentines,\\nwas one Georgius Gemisthos, a Greek philosopher of much personal\\ncharm and comeliness, who talked a bland and beautiful Platonism that\\nwas extremely alluring not only to his youthful listeners but also\\nto Cosimo himself. Gemisthos was, however, a Greek, and Cosimo was\\ntoo busy a man in a city of enemies, or at any rate of the envious,\\nto be able to do much more than extend his patronage to the old man\\nand despatch emissaries to the East for more and more manuscripts;\\nbut discerning the allurements of the new gospel, Cosimo directed\\na Florentine enthusiast who knew Greek to spread the serene creed\\namong his friends, who were all ripe for it, and this enthusiast was\\nnone other than a youthful scholar by name Marsilio Ficino, connected\\nwith S. Lorenzo, Cosimo's family church, and the son of Cosimo's own\\nphysician. To the young and ardent Marsilio, Plato became a god and\\nGemisthos not less than divine for bringing the tidings. He kept a lamp\\nalways burning before Plato's bust, and later founded the Platonic\\nAcademy, at which Plato's works were discussed, orations delivered,\\nand new dialogues exchanged, between such keen minds as Marsilio,\\nPulci, Landini, Giovanni Cavalcanti, Leon Battista Alberti, the\\narchitect and scholar, Pico dell a Mirandola, the precocious disputant\\nand aristocratic mystic, Poliziano, the tutor of Lorenzo's sons, and\\nLorenzo the Magnificent himself. It was thus from the Greek invasion\\nof Florence that proceeded the stream of culture which is known as\\nHumanism, and which, no doubt, in time, was so largely concerned in\\nbringing about that indifference to spiritual things which, leading\\nto general laxity and indulgence, filled Savonarola with despair.\\n\\nI am not concerned to enter deeply into the subject of the\\nRenaissance. But this must be said -- that the new painting and\\nsculpture, particularly the painting of Masaccio and the sculpture\\nof Donatello, had shown the world that the human being could be made\\nthe measure of the Divine. The Madonna and Christ had been related\\nto life. The new learning, by leading these keen Tuscan intellects,\\nso eager for reasonableness, to the Greek philosophers who were so\\nwise and so calm without any of the consolations of Christianity,\\nnaturally set them wondering if there were not a religion of Humanity\\nthat was perhaps a finer thing than the religion that required all the\\nmachinery and intrigue of Rome. And when, as the knowledge of Greek\\nspread and the minute examination of documents ensued, it was found\\nthat Rome had not disdained forgery to gain her ends, a blow was struck\\nagainst the Church from which it never recovered; -- and how much of this\\nwas due to this Florentine Marsilio, sitting at the feet of the Greek\\nGemisthos, who came to Florence at the invitation of Cosimo de' Medici!\\n\\nThe cathedral glass, as I say, is mostly overladen with grime; but the\\ncircular windows in the dome seem to be magnificent in design. They\\nare attributed to Ghiberti and Donatello, and are lovely in colour. The\\ngreens in particular are very striking. But the jewel of these circular\\nwindows of Florence is that by Ghiberti on the west wall of S. Croce.\\n\\nAnd here I leave the Duomo, with the counsel to visitors to Florence\\nto make a point of entering it every day -- not, as so many Florentines\\ndo, in order to make a short cut from the Via Calzaioli to the Via de'\\nServi, and vice vers\\u00e2, but to gather its spirit. It is different every\\nhour in the day, and every hour the light enters it with new beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nThe Duomo III: A Ceremony and a Museum\\n\\nThe Scoppio del Carro -- The Pazzi beneficent -- Holy Saturday's\\nprogramme -- April 6th, 1912 -- The flying palle -- The nervous\\npyrotechnist -- The influence of noon -- A little sister of the\\nDuomo -- Donatello's cantoria -- Luca della Robbia's cantoria.\\n\\nIn the last chapter we saw the Pazzi family as very black sheep,\\nalthough there are plenty of students of Florentine history who\\nhold that any attempt to rid Florence of the Medici was laudable. In\\nthis chapter we see them in a kindlier situation as benefactors to\\nthe city. For it happened that when Pazzo de' Pazzi, a founder of\\nthe house, was in the Holy Land during the First Crusade, it was his\\nproud lot to set the Christian banner on the walls of Jerusalem, and,\\nas a reward, Godfrey of Boulogne gave him some flints from the Holy\\nSepulchre. These he brought to Florence, and they are now preserved\\nat SS. Apostoli, the little church in the Piazza del Limbo, off the\\nBorgo SS. Apostoli, and every year the flints are used to kindle\\nthe fire needed for the right preservation of Easter Day. Gradually\\nthe ceremony enlarged until it became a spectacle indeed, which the\\nPazzi family for centuries controlled. After the Pazzi conspiracy\\nthey lost it and the Signoria took it over; but, on being pardoned,\\nthe Pazzi again resumed.\\n\\nThe Carro is a car containing explosives, and the Scoppio is its\\nexplosion. This car, after being drawn in procession through the\\nstreets by white oxen, is ignited by the sacred fire borne to it by\\na mechanical dove liberated at the high altar of the Duomo, and with\\nits explosion Easter begins. There is still a Pazzi fund towards the\\nexpenses, but a few years ago the city became responsible for the\\nwhole proceedings, and the ceremony as it is now given, under civic\\nmanagement, known as the Scoppio del Cairo, is that which I saw on\\nHoly Saturday last and am about to describe.\\n\\nFirst, however, let me state what had happened before the proceedings\\nopened in the Piazza del Duomo. At six o'clock mass began at\\nSS. Apostoli, lasting for more than two hours. At its close the\\ncelebrant was handed a plate on which were the sacred flints, and these\\nhe struck with a steel in view of the congregation, thus igniting a\\ntaper. The candle, in an ancient copper porta fuoco surmounted by a\\ndove, was then lighted, and the procession of priests started off for\\nthe cathedral with their precious flame, escorted by a civic guard\\nand various standard bearers. Their route was the Piazza del Limbo,\\nalong the Borgo SS. Apostoli to the Via Por S. Maria and through\\nthe Vacchereccia to the Piazza della Signoria, the Via Condotta, the\\nVia del Proconsolo, to the Duomo, through whose central doors they\\npassed, depositing the sacred burden at the high altar. I should add\\nthat anyone on the route in charge of a street shrine had the right\\nto stop the procession in order to take a light from it; while at\\nSS. Apostoli women congregated with tapers and lanterns in the hope\\nof getting these kindled from the sacred flame, in order to wash\\ntheir babies or cook their food in water heated with the fire.\\n\\nMeanwhile at seven o'clock the four oxen, which are kept in the\\nCascine all the year round and do no other work, had been harnessed to\\nthe car and had drawn it to the Piazza del Duomo, which was reached\\nabout nine. The oxen were then tethered by the Pisano doors of the\\nBaptistery until needed again.\\n\\nAfter some haggling on the night before, I had secured a seat on a\\nbalcony facing Ghiberti's first Baptistery doors, for eleven lire, and\\nto this place I went at half-past ten. The piazza was then filling up,\\nand at a quarter to eleven the trams running between the Cathedral and\\nthe Baptistery were stopped. In this space was the car. The present\\none, which dates from 1622, is more like a catafalque, and unless one\\nsees it in motion, with the massive white oxen pulling it, one cannot\\nbelieve in it as a vehicle at all. It is some thirty feet high, all\\nblack, with trumpery coloured-paper festoons (concealing fireworks)\\nupon it: trumpery as only the Roman Catholic Church can contrive. It\\nstood in front of the Duomo some four yards from the Baptistery gates\\nin a line with the Duomo's central doors and the high altar. The\\ndoors were open, seats being placed on each side of the aisle the\\nwhole distance, and people making a solid avenue. Down this avenue\\nwere to come the clergy, and above it was to be stretched the line\\non which the dove was to travel from the altar, with the Pazzi fire,\\nto ignite the car.\\n\\nThe space in front of the cathedral was cleared at about eleven,\\nand cocked hats and red-striped trousers then became the most\\nnoticeable feature. The crowd was jolly and perhaps a little cynical;\\npicture-postcard hawkers made most of the noise, and for some reason\\nor other a forlorn peasant took this opportunity to offer for sale two\\nequally forlorn hedgehogs. Each moment the concourse increased, for it\\nis a fateful day and every one wants to know the issue: because, you\\nsee, if the dove runs true, lights the car, and returns, as a good dove\\nshould, to the altar ark, there will be a prosperous vintage and the\\npyrotechnist who controls the sacred bird's movements will receive his\\nwages. But if the dove runs defectively and there is any hitch, every\\none is dismayed, for the harvest will be bad and the pyrotechnist will\\nreceive nothing. Once he was imprisoned when things went astray -- and\\nquite right too -- but the Florentines have grown more lenient.\\n\\nAt about a quarter past eleven a procession of clergy emerged from the\\nDuomo and crossed the space to the Baptistery. First, boys and youths\\nin surplices. Then some scarlet hoods, waddling. Then purple hoods,\\nand other colours, a little paunchier, waddling more, and lastly the\\narchbishop, very sumptuous. All having disappeared into the Baptistery,\\nthrough Ghiberti's second gates, which I never saw opened before, the\\ndove's wire was stretched and fastened, a matter needing much care;\\nand the crowds began to surge. The cocked hats and officers had the\\nspace all to themselves, with the car, the firemen, the pyrotechnist\\nand the few privileged and very self-conscious civilians who were\\nallowed inside.\\n\\nA curious incident, which many years ago might have been magnified\\ninto a portent, occurred while the ecclesiastics were in the Artistry.\\nSome one either bought and liberated several air balloons, or the\\nstring holding them was surreptitiously cut; but however it happened,\\nthe balls escaped and suddenly the crowd sent up a triumphant yell. At\\nfirst I could see no reason for it, the Baptistery intervening,\\nbut then the balls swam into our ken and steadily floated over\\nthe cathedral out of sight amid tremendous satisfaction. And the\\nportent? Well, as they moved against the blue sky they formed\\nthemselves into precisely the pattern of the palle on the Medici\\nescutcheon. That is all. But think what that would have meant in the\\nfifteenth century; the nods and frowns it would have occasioned; the\\ndispersal of the Medici, the loss of power, and all the rest of it,\\nthat it would have presaged!\\n\\nAt about twenty to twelve the ecclesiastics returned and were\\nswallowed up by the Duomo, and then excitement began to be acute. The\\npyrotechnist was not free from it; he fussed about nervously; he tested\\neverything again and again; he crawled under the car and out of it;\\nhe talked to officials; he inspected and re-inspected. Photographers\\nbegan to adjust their distances; the detached men in bowlers looked\\nat their watches; the cocked hats drew nearer to the Duomo door. And\\nthen we heard a tearing noise. All eyes were turned to the great door,\\nand out rushed the dove emitting a wake of sparks, entered the car\\nand was out again on its homeward journey before one realized what had\\nhappened. And then the explosions began, and the bells -- silent since\\nThursday -- broke out. How many explosions there were I do not know;\\nbut they seemed to go on for ten minutes.\\n\\nThis is a great moment not only for the spectator but for all Florence,\\nfor in myriad rooms mothers have been waiting, with their babies\\non their knees, for the first clang of the belfries, because if a\\nchild's eyes are washed then it is unlikely ever to have weak sight,\\nwhile if a baby takes its first steps to this accompaniment its legs\\nwill not be bowed.\\n\\nAt the last explosion the pyrotechnist, now a calm man once more\\nand a proud one, approached the car, the firemen poured water on\\nsmouldering parts, and the work of clearing up began. Then came\\nthe patient oxen, their horns and hooves gilt, and great masses of\\nflowers on their heads, and red cloths with the lily of Florence\\non it over their backs -- much to be regretted since they obliterated\\ntheir beautiful white skins -- and slowly the car lumbered off, and,\\nthe cocked hats relenting, the crowd poured after it and the Scoppio\\ndel Carro was over.\\n\\nThe Duomo has a little sister in the shape of the Museo di Santa\\nMaria del Fiore, or the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo, situated in the\\nPiazza opposite the apse; and we should go there now. This museum,\\nwhich is at once the smallest and, with the exception of the Natural\\nHistory Museum, the cheapest of the Florentine museums, for it\\ncosts but half a lira, is notable for containing the two cantorie,\\nor singing galleries, made for the cathedral, one by Donatello and\\none by Luca della Robbia. A cantoria by Donatello we shall soon see in\\nits place in S. Lorenzo; but that, beautiful as it is, cannot compare\\nwith this one, with its procession of merry, dancing children, its\\nmassiveness and grace, its joyous ebullitions of gold mosaic and blue\\nenamel. Both the cantorie -- Donatello's, begun in 1433 and finished\\nin 1439, and Luca's, begun in 1431 and finished in 1438 -- fulfilled\\ntheir melodious functions in the Duomo until 1688, when they were\\nruthlessly cleared away to make room for large wooden balconies to\\nbe used in connexion with the nuptials of Ferdinand de' Medici and\\nthe Princess Violante of Bavaria. In the year 1688 taste was at a low\\nebb, and no one thought the deposed cantorie even worth preservation,\\nso that they were broken up and occasionally levied upon for cornices\\nand so forth. The fragments were collected and taken to the Bargello\\nin the middle of the last century, and in 1883 Signer del Moro, the\\nthen architect of the Duomo (whose bust is in the courtyard of this\\nmuseum), reconstructed them to the best of his ability in their present\\nsituation. It has to be remembered not only that, with the exception\\nof the figures, the galleries are not as their artists made them,\\nlacking many beautiful accessories, but that, as Vasari tells us,\\nDonatello deliberately designed his for a dim light. None the less,\\nthey remain two of the most delightful works of the Renaissance and\\ntwo of the rarest treasures of Florence.\\n\\nThe dancing boys behind the small pillars with their gold chequering,\\nthe brackets, and the urn of the cornice over the second pair\\nof pillars from the right, are all that remain of Donatello's own\\nhandiwork. All else is new and conjectural. It is supposed that bronze\\nheads of lions filled the two circular spaces between the brackets\\nin the middle. But although the loss of the work as a whole is to be\\nregretted, the dancing boys remain, to be for ever an inspiration and\\na pleasure. The Luca della Robbia cantoria opposite is not quite so\\ntriumphant a masterpiece, but from the point of view of suitability it\\nis perhaps better. We can believe that Luca's children hymn the glory\\nof the Lord, as indeed the inscription makes them, whereas Donatello's\\nromp with a gladness that might easily be purely pagan. Luca's design\\nis more formal, more conventional; Donatello's is rich and free and\\nfluid with personality. The two end panels of Luca's are supplied in\\nthe cantoria by casts; the originals are on the wall below and may\\nbe carefully studied. The animation and fervour of these choristers\\nare unforgettable.\\n\\nIt is well, while enjoying Donatello's work, to remember that Prato\\nis only half an hour from Florence, and that there may be seen\\nthe open-air pulpit, built on the corner of the cathedral, which\\nDonatello, with Michelozzo, his friend and colleague, made at the\\nsame time that the cantoria was in progress, and which in its relief\\nof happy children is very similar, although not, I think, quite so\\nremarkable. It lacks also the peculiarly naturalistic effect gained\\nin the cantoria by setting the dancing boys behind the pillars, which\\nundoubtedly, as comparison with the Luca shows, assists realism. The\\nrow of pillars attracts the eye first and the boys are thus thrown\\ninto a background which almost moves.\\n\\nAlthough the cantorie dominate the museum they must not be allowed to\\novershadow all else. A marble relief of the Madonna and Children by\\nAgostino di Duccio (1418-1481) must be sought for: it is No. 77 and\\nthe children are the merriest in Florence. Another memorable Madonna\\nand Child is No. 94, by Pagno di Lapo Portigiani (1406-1470), who has\\ninterest for us in this place as being one of Donatello's assistants,\\nvery possibly on this very cantoria, and almost certainly on the Prato\\npulpit. Everything here, it must be remembered, has some association\\nwith the Duomo and was brought here for careful preservation and that\\nwhoever has fifty centimes might take pleasure in seeing it; but the\\ngreat silver altar is from the Baptistery, and being made for that\\ntemple is naturally dedicated to the life of John the Baptist. Although\\nmuch of it was the work of not the greatest modellers in the second\\nhalf of the fourteenth century, three masters at least contributed\\nlater: Michelozzo adding the statue of the Baptist, Pollaiuolo the\\nside relief depicting his birth, and Verrocchio that of his death,\\nwhich is considered one of the most remarkable works of this sculptor,\\nwhom we are to find so richly represented at the Bargello. Before\\nleaving this room, look for 100^3, an unknown terra-cotta of the\\nBirth of Eve, which is both masterly and amusing, and 110^4, a very\\nlovely intaglio in wood. I might add that among the few paintings,\\nall very early, is a S. Sebastian in whose sacred body I counted no\\nfewer than thirty arrows; which within my knowledge of pictures of\\nthis saint -- not inconsiderable -- is the highest number.\\n\\nThe next room is given to models and architectural plans and\\ndrawings connected with the cathedral, the most interesting thing\\nbeing Brunelleschi's own model for the lantern. On the stairs are a\\nseries of fine bas-reliefs by Bandinelli and Giovanni dell' Opera from\\nthe old choir screen of the Duomo, and downstairs, among many other\\npieces of sculpture, is a bust of Brunelleschi from a death-mask and\\nseveral beautiful della Robbia designs for lunettes over doors.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nThe Campanile and the Baptistery\\n\\nA short way with Veronese critics -- Giotto's missing spire -- Donatello's\\nholy men -- Giotto as encyclopaedist -- The seven and twenty\\nreliefs -- Ruskin in American -- At the top of the tower -- A sea of\\nred roofs -- The restful Baptistery -- Historic stones -- An ex-Pope's\\ntomb -- Andrea Pisano's doors -- Ghiberti's first doors -- Ghiberti's second\\ndoors -- Michelangelo's praise -- A gentleman artist.\\n\\nIt was in 1332, as I have said, that Giotto was made capo-maestro,\\nand on July 18th, 1334, the first stone of his campanile was laid, the\\nunderstanding being that the structure was to exceed \\\"in magnificence,\\nheight, and excellence of workmanship\\\" anything in the world. As\\nsome further indication of the glorious feeling of patriotism then\\nanimating the Florentines, it may be remarked that when a Veronese\\nwho happened to be in Florence ventured to suggest that the city\\nwas aiming rather too high, he was at once thrown into gaol, and,\\non being set free when his time was done, was shown the treasury as\\nan object lesson. Of the wealth and purposefulness of Florence at\\nthat time, in spite of the disastrous bellicose period she had been\\npassing through, Villani the historian, who wrote history as it was\\nbeing made, gives an excellent account, which Macaulay summarizes in\\nhis vivid way. Thus: \\\"The revenue of the Republic amounted to three\\nhundred thousand florins; a sum which, allowing for the depreciation of\\nthe precious metals, was at least equivalent to six hundred thousand\\npounds sterling; a larger sum than England and Ireland, two centuries\\nago, yielded to Elizabeth. The manufacture of wool alone employed two\\nhundred factories and thirty thousand workmen. The cloth annually\\nproduced sold, at an average, for twelve hundred thousand florins;\\na sum fully equal in exchangeable value to two millions and a half of\\nour money. Four hundred thousand florins were annually coined. Eighty\\nbanks conducted the commercial operations, not of Florence only but of\\nall Europe. The transactions of these establishments were sometimes\\nof a magnitude which may surprise even the contemporaries of the\\nBarings and the Rothschilds. Two houses advanced to Edward III of\\nEngland upwards of three hundred thousand marks, at a time when the\\nmark contained more silver than fifty shillings of the present day,\\nand when the value of silver was more than quadruple of what it now\\nis. The city and its environs contained a hundred and seventy thousand\\nchildren inhabitants. In the various schools about ten thousand\\nchildren were taught to read; twelve hundred studied arithmetic;\\nsix hundred received a learned education.\\\"\\n\\nGiotto died in 1386, and after his death, as I have said, Andrea\\nPisano came in for a while; to be followed by Talenti, who is said\\nto have made considerable alterations in Giotto's design and to\\nbe responsible for the happy idea of increasing the height of the\\nwindows with the height of the tower and thus adding to the illusion\\nof springing lightness. The topmost ones, so bold in size and so\\nlovely with their spiral columns, almost seem to lift it.\\n\\nThe campanile to-day is 276 feet in height, and Giotto proposed to\\nadd to that a spire of 105 feet. The Florentines completed the fa\\u00e7ade\\nof the cathedral in 1887 and are now spending enormous sums on the\\nMedici chapel at S. Lorenzo; why should they not one day carry out\\ntheir greatest artist's intention?\\n\\nThe campanile as a structure had been finished in 1387, but not for\\nmany years did it receive its statues, of which something must be said,\\nalthough it is impossible to get more than a vague idea of them, so\\nhigh are they. A captive balloon should be arranged for the use of\\nvisitors. Those by Donatello, on the Baptistery side, are the most\\nremarkable. The first of these -- that nearest to the cathedral and\\nthe most striking as seen from the distant earth -- is called John the\\nBaptist, always a favourite subject with this sculptor, who, since\\nhe more than any at that thoughtful time endeavoured to discover\\nand disclose the secret of character, is curiously unfortunate in\\nthe accident that has fastened names to these figures. This John,\\nfor example, bears no relation to his other Baptists; nor does the\\nnext figure represent David, as is generally supposed, but owes that\\nerror to the circumstance that when the David that originally stood\\nhere was moved to the north side, the old plinth bearing his name was\\nleft behind. This famous figure is stated by Vasari to be a portrait of\\na Florentine merchant named Barduccio Cherichini, and for centuries it\\nhas been known as Il Zuccone (or pumpkin) from its baldness. Donatello,\\naccording to Vasari, had a particular liking for the work, so much that\\nhe used to swear by it; while, when engaged upon it, he is said to\\nhave so believed in its reality as to exclaim, \\\"Speak, speak! or may\\na dysentery seize thee!\\\" It is now generally considered to represent\\nJob, and we cannot too much regret the impossibility of getting near\\nenough to study it. Next is the Jeremiah, which, according to Vasari,\\nwas a portrait of another Florentine, but which, since he bears his\\nname on a scroll, may none the less be taken to realize the sculptor's\\nidea of Jeremiah. It is (according to the photographs) a fine piece\\nof rugged vivacity, and the head is absolutely that of a real man. On\\nthe opposite side of the tower is the magnificent Abraham's sacrifice\\nfrom the same strong hand, and by it Habakkuk, who is no less near\\nlife than the Jeremiah and Job, but a very different type. At both\\nOr San Michele and the Bargello we are to find Donatello perhaps in\\na finer mood than here, and comfortably visible.\\n\\nFor most visitors to Florence and all disciples of Ruskin, the chief\\ninterest of the campanile (\\\"The Shepherd's Tower\\\" as he calls it)\\nis the series of twenty-seven reliefs illustrating the history of\\nthe world and the progress of mankind, which are to be seen round the\\nbase, the design, it is supposed, of Giotto, executed by Andrea Pisano\\nand Luca della Robbia. To Andrea are given all those on the west (7),\\nsouth (7), east (5), and the two eastern ones on the north; to Luca the\\nremaining five on the north. Ruskin's fascinating analysis of these\\nreliefs should most certainly be read (without a total forgetfulness\\nof the shepherd's other activities as a painter, architect, humorist,\\nand friend of princes and poets), but equally certainly not in the\\nAmerican pirated edition which the Florentine booksellers are so ready\\n(to their shame) to sell you. Only Ruskin in his best mood of fury\\ncould begin to do justice to the misspellings and mispunctuations of\\nthis terrible production.\\n\\nRuskin, I may say, believes several of the carvings to be from\\nGiotto's own chisel as well as design, but other and more modern\\nauthorities disagree, although opinion now inclines to the belief\\nthat the designs for Pisano's Baptistery doors are also his. Such\\nthoroughness and ingenuity were all in Giotto's way, and they certainly\\nsuggest his active mind. The campanile series begins at the west side\\nwith the creation of man. Among the most attractive are, I think,\\nthose devoted to agriculture, with the spirited oxen, to astronomy, to\\narchitecture, to weaving, and to pottery. Giotto was even so thorough\\nas to give one relief to the conquest of the air; and he makes Noah\\nmost satisfactorily drunk. Note also the Florentine fleur-de-lis\\nround the base of the tower. Every fleur-de-lis in Florence is\\nbeautiful -- even those on advertisements and fire-plugs -- but few are\\nmore beautiful than these.\\n\\nI climbed the campanile one fine morning -- 417 steps from the\\nground -- and was well repaid; but I think it is wiser to ascend the\\ntower of the Palazzo Vecchio, because one is higher there and, since\\nthe bulk of the dome, which intrudes from the campanile, is avoided,\\none has a better all-round view. Florence seen from this eminence\\nis very red -- so uniformly so that many towers rise against it almost\\nindistinguishably, particularly the Bargello's and the Badia's. One\\nsees at once how few straight streets there are -- the Ricasoli standing\\nout among them as the exception; and one realizes how the city has\\ndeveloped outside, with its boulevards where the walls once were,\\nleaving the gates isolated, and its cincture of factories. The\\noccasional glimpses of cloisters and verdure among the red are very\\npleasant. One of the objects cut off by the cathedral dome is the\\nEnglish cemetery, but the modern Jewish temple stands out as noticeably\\nalmost as any of the ancient buildings. The Pitti looks like nothing\\nbut a barracks and the Porta Ferdinando has prominence which it gets\\nfrom no other point. The roof of the Mercato Centrale is the ugliest\\nthing in the view. While I was there the midday gun from the Boboli\\nfortress was fired, instantly having its punctual double effect of\\nsending all the pigeons up in a grey cloud of simulated alarm and\\nstarting every bell in the city.\\n\\nThose wishing to make either the campanile or Duomo ascents must\\nremember to do it early. The closing hour for the day being twelve,\\nno one is allowed to start up after about a quarter past eleven: a\\nvery foolish arrangement, since Florence and the surrounding Apennines\\nunder a slanting sun are more beautiful than in the morning glare,\\nand the ascent would be less fatiguing. As it was, on descending, after\\nbeing so long at the top, I was severely reprimanded by the custodian,\\nwho had previously marked me down as a barbarian for refusing his offer\\nof field-glasses. But the Palazzo Vecchio tower is open till five.\\n\\nThe Baptistery is the beautiful octagonal building opposite the\\ncathedral, and once the cathedral itself. It dates from the seventh\\nor eighth century, but as we see it now is a product chiefly of the\\nthirteenth. The bronze doors opposite the Via Calzaioli are open every\\nday, a circumstance which visitors, baffled by the two sets of Ghiberti\\ndoors always so firmly closed, are apt to overlook. All children born\\nin Florence are still baptized here, and I watched one afternoon an old\\npriest at the task, a tiny Florentine being brought in to receive the\\nname of Tosca, which she did with less distaste than most, considering\\nhow thorough was his sprinkling. The Baptistery is rich in colour\\nboth without and within. The floor alone is a marvel of intricate\\ninlaying, including the signs of the zodiac and a gnomic sentence which\\nreads the same backwards and forwards -- \\\"En gire torte sol ciclos et\\nroterigne\\\". On this very pavement Dante, who called the church his\\n\\\"beautiful San Giovanni,\\\" has walked. Over the altar is a gigantic\\nand primitive Christ in mosaic, more splendid than spiritual. The\\nmosaics in the recesses of the clerestory -- grey and white -- are the\\nmost soft and lovely of all. I believe the Baptistery is the most\\nrestful place in Florence; and this is rather odd considering that it\\nis all marble and mosaic patterns. But its shape is very soothing,\\nand age has given it a quality of its own, and there is just that\\ntouch of barbarism about it such as one gets in Byzantine buildings\\nto lend it a peculiar character here.\\n\\nThe most notable sculpture in the Baptistery is the tomb of the ex-Pope\\nJohn XXIII, whose licentiousness was such that there was nothing for\\nit but to depose and imprison him. He had, however, much money, and on\\nhis liberation he settled in Florence, presented a true finger of John\\nthe Baptist to the Baptistery, and arranged in return for his bones\\nto repose in that sanctuary. One of his executors was that Niccol\\u00f2\\nda Uzzano, the head of the noble faction in the city, whose coloured\\nbust by Donatello is in the Bargello. The tomb is exceedingly fine,\\nthe work of Donatello and his partner Michelozzo, who were engaged\\nto make it by Giovanni de' Medici, the ex-pontiff's friend, and the\\nfather of the great Cosimo. The design is all Donatello's, and his\\nthe recumbent cleric, lying very naturally, hardly as if dead at\\nall, a little on one side, so that his face is seen nearly full;\\nthe three figures beneath are Michelozzo's; but Donatello probably\\ncarved the seated angels who display the scroll which bears the\\ndead Pope's name. The Madonna and Child above are by Donatello's\\nassistant, Pagno di Lapo Portigiani, a pretty relief by whom we saw\\nin the Museum of the Cathedral. Being in red stone, and very dusty,\\nlike Ghiberti's doors (which want the hose regularly), the lines of\\nthe tomb are much impaired. Donatello is also represented here by a\\nMary Magdalene in wood, on an altar at the left of the entrance door,\\nvery powerful and poignant.\\n\\nIn the ordinary way, when visitors to Florence speak of the Baptistery\\ndoors they mean those opposite the Duomo, and when they go to the\\nBargello and look at the designs made by Ghiberti and Brunelleschi in\\ncompetition, they think that the competition was for those. But that\\nis wrong. Ghiberti won his spurs with the doors on the north side,\\nat which comparatively few persons look. The famous doors opposite\\nthe Duomo were commissioned many years later, when his genius was\\nacknowledged and when he had become so accomplished as to do what\\nhe liked with his medium. Before, however, coming to Ghiberti,\\nwe ought to look at the work of an early predecessor but for whom\\nthere might have been no Ghiberti at all; for while Ghiberti was at\\nwork with his assistants on these north doors, between 1403 and 1424,\\nthe place which they occupy was filled by those executed seventy years\\nearlier by Andrea Pisano (1270-1348), possibly from Giotto's designs,\\nwhich are now at the south entrance, opposite the charming little\\nloggia at the corner of the Via Calzaioli, called the Bigallo. These\\nrepresent twenty scenes in the life of S. John the Baptist, and below\\nthem are eight figures of cardinal and Christian virtues, and they\\nemployed their sculptor from 1330 to 1336. They have three claims to\\nnotice: as being admirably simple and vigorous in themselves; as having\\ninfluenced all later workers in this medium, and particularly Ghiberti\\nand Donatello; and as being the bronze work of the sculptor of certain\\nof the stone scenes round the base of Giotto's campanile. The panel\\nin which the Baptist is seen up to his waist in the water is surely\\nthe very last word in audacity in bronze. Ghiberti was charged with\\nmaking bronze do things that it was ill fitted for; but I do not know\\nthat even he moulded water -- and transparent water -- from it.\\n\\nThe year 1399 is one of the most notable in the history of modern art,\\nsince it was then that the competition for the Baptistery gates was\\nmade public, this announcement being the spring from which many rivers\\nflowed. In that year Lorenzo Ghiberti, a young goldsmith assisting\\nhis father, was twenty-one, and Filippo Brunelleschi, another\\ngoldsmith, was twenty-two, while Giotto had been dead sixty-three\\nyears and the impulse he had given to painting had almost worked\\nitself out. The new doors were to be of the same shape and size as\\nthose by Andrea Pisano, which were already getting on for seventy\\nyears old, and candidates were invited to make a specimen relief to\\nscale, representing the interrupted sacrifice of Isaac, although\\nthe subject-matter of the doors was to be the Life of S. John the\\nBaptist. Among the judges was that Florentine banker whose name\\nwas beginning to be known in the city as a synonym for philanthropy,\\nenlightenment, and sagacity, Giovanni de' Medici. In 1401 the specimens\\nwere ready, and after much deliberation as to which was the better,\\nGhiberti's or Brunelleschi's -- assisted, some say, by Brunelleschi's\\nown advice in favour of his rival -- the award was given to Ghiberti,\\nand he was instructed to proceed with his task; while Brunelleschi,\\nas we have seen, being a man of determined ambition, left for Rome to\\nstudy architecture, having made up his mind to be second to no one\\nin whichever of the arts and crafts he decided to pursue. Here then\\nwas the first result of the competition -- that it turned Brunelleschi\\nto architecture.\\n\\nGhiberti began seriously in 1408 and continued till 1424, when the\\ndoors were finished; but, in order to carry out the work, he required\\nassistance in casting and so forth, and for that purpose engaged among\\nothers a sculptor named Donatello (born in 1386), a younger sculptor\\nnamed Luca della Robbia (born in 1400), and a gigantic young painter\\ncalled Masaccio (born in 1401), each of whom was destined, taking\\nfire no doubt from Ghiberti and his fine free way, to be a powerful\\ninnovator -- Donatello (apart from other and rarer achievements) being\\nthe first sculptor since antiquity to place a statue on a pedestal\\naround which observers could walk; Masaccio being the first painter\\nto make pictures in the modern use of the term, with men and women\\nof flesh and blood in them, as distinguished from decorative saints,\\nand to be by example the instructor of all the greatest masters,\\nfrom his pupil Lippo Lippi to Leonardo and Michelangelo; and Luca\\ndella Robbia being the inspired discoverer of an inexpensive means of\\nglazing terra-cotta so that his beautiful and radiant Madonnas could\\nbe brought within the purchasing means of the poorest congregation in\\nItaly. These alone are remarkable enough results, but when we recollect\\nalso that Brunelleschi's defeat led to the building of the cathedral\\ndome, the significance of the event becomes the more extraordinary.\\n\\nThe doors, as I say, were finished in 1424, after twenty-one years'\\nlabour, and the Signoria left the Palazzo Vecchio in procession to see\\ntheir installation. In the number and shape of the panels Pisano set\\nthe standard, but Ghiberti's work resembled that of his predecessor\\nvery little in other ways, for he had a mind of domestic sweetness\\nwithout austerity and he was interested in making everything as easy\\nand fluid and beautiful as might be. His thoroughness recalls Giotto\\nin certain of his frescoes. The impression left by Pisano's doors is\\nakin to that left by reading the New Testament; but Ghiberti makes\\neverything happier than that. Two scenes -- both on the level of the\\neye -- I particularly like: the \\\"Annunciation,\\\" with its little, lithe,\\nreluctant Virgin, and the \\\"Adoration\\\". The border of the Pisano doors\\nis, I think, finer than that of Ghiberti's; but it is a later work.\\n\\nLooking at them even now, with eyes that remember so much of the\\nbest art that followed them and took inspiration from them, we\\ncan understand the better how delighted Florence must have been\\nwith this new picture gallery and how the doors were besieged by\\nsightseers. But greater still was to come. Ghiberti at once received\\nthe commission to make two more doors on his own scale for the south\\nside of the Baptistery, and in 1425 he had begun on them. These were\\nnot finished until 1452, so that Ghiberti, then a man of seventy-four,\\nhad given practically his whole life to the making of four bronze\\ndoors. It is true that he did a few other things besides, such as the\\ncasket of S. Zenobius in the Duomo, and the Baptist and S. Matthew\\nfor Or San Michele; but he may be said justly to live by his doors,\\nand particularly by the second pair, although it was the first pair\\nthat had the greater effect on his contemporaries and followers.\\n\\nAmong his assistants on these were Antonio Pollaiuolo (born in\\n1429), who designed the quail in the left border, and Paolo Uccello\\n(born in 1397), both destined to be men of influence. The bald head\\non the right door is a portrait of Ghiberti; that of the old man\\non the left is his father, who helped him to polish the original\\ncompetition plaque. Although commissioned for the south side they\\nwere placed where they now are, on the east, as being most worthy of\\nthe position of honour, and Pisano's doors, which used to be here,\\nwere moved to the south, where they now are.\\n\\nOn Ghiberti's workshop opposite S. Maria Nuova, in the Via Bufalini,\\nthe memorial tablet mentions Michelangelo's praise -- that these doors\\nwere beautiful enough to be the Gates of Paradise. After that what is\\nan ordinary person to say? That they are lovely is a commonplace. But\\nthey are more. They are so sensitive; bronze, the medium which Horace\\nhas called, by implication, the most durable of all, has become in\\nGhiberti's hands almost as soft as wax and tender as flesh. It does\\nall he asks; it almost moves; every trace of sternness has vanished\\nfrom it. Nothing in plastic art that we have ever seen or shall see\\nis more easy and ingratiating than these almost living pictures.\\n\\nBefore them there is steadily a little knot of admirers, and on\\nSundays you may always see country people explaining the panels to each\\nother. Every one has his favourite among these fascinating Biblical\\nscenes, and mine are Cain and Abel, with the ploughing, and Abraham\\nand Isaac, with its row of fir trees. It has been explained by the\\npurists that the sculptor stretched the bounds of plastic art too\\nfar and made bronze paint pictures; but most persons will agree to\\nignore that. Of the charm of Ghiberti's mind the border gives further\\nevidence, with its fruits and foliage, birds and woodland creatures,\\nso true to life, and here fixed for all time, so naturally, that if\\nthese animals should ever (as is not unlikely in Italy where every\\none has a gun and shoots at his pleasure) become extinct, they could\\nbe created again from these designs.\\n\\nGhiberti, who enjoyed great honour in his life and a considerable\\nsalary as joint architect of the dome with Brunelleschi, died three\\nyears after the completion of the second doors and was buried in\\nS. Croce. His place in Florentine art is unique and glorious.\\n\\nThe broken porphyry pillars by these second doors were a gift from\\nPisa to Florence in recognition of Florence's watchfulness over Pisa\\nwhile the Pisans were away subduing the Balearic islanders.\\n\\nThe bronze group over Ghiberti's first doors, representing John\\nthe Baptist preaching between a Pharisee and a Levite, are the\\nwork (either alone or assisted by his master Leonardo da Vinci)\\nof an interesting Florentine sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Rustici\\n(1474-1554), who was remarkable among the artists of his time in\\nbeing what we should call an amateur, having a competence of his own\\nand the manners of a patron. Placing himself under Verrocchio, he\\nbecame closely attached to Leonardo, a fellow-pupil, and made him his\\nmodel rather than the older man. He took his art lightly, and lived,\\nin Vasari's phrase, \\\"free from care,\\\" having such beguilements as a\\ntame menagerie (Leonardo, it will be remembered, loved animals too and\\nhad a habit of buying small caged birds in order to set them free),\\nand two or three dining clubs, the members of which vied with each\\nother in devising curious and exotic dishes. Andrea del Sarto, for\\nexample, once brought as his contribution to the feast a model of this\\nvery church we are studying, the Baptistery, of which the floor was\\nconstructed of jelly, the pillars of sausages, and the choir desk of\\ncold veal, while the choristers were roast thrushes. Rustici further\\npaved the way to a life free from care by appointing a steward of his\\nestate whose duty it was to see that his money-box, to which he went\\nwhenever he wanted anything, always had money in it. This box he never\\nlocked, having learned that he need fear no robbery by once leaving\\nhis cloak for two days under a bush and then finding it again. \\\"This\\nworld,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"is too good: it will not last.\\\" Among his pets\\nwere a porcupine trained to prick the legs of his guests under the\\ntable \\\"so that they drew them in quickly\\\"; a raven that spoke like a\\nhuman being; an eagle, and many snakes. He also studied necromancy,\\nthe better to frighten his apprentices. He left Florence in 1528,\\nafter the Medici expulsion, and, like Leonardo, took service with\\nFrancis the First. He died at the age of eighty.\\n\\nI had an hour and more exactly opposite the Rustici group, on the same\\nlevel, while waiting for the Scoppio del Carro, and I find it easy\\nto believe that Leonardo himself had a hand in the work. The figure\\nof the Baptist is superb, the attitude of his listeners masterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nThe Riccardi Palace and the Medici\\n\\nAn evasion of history -- \\\"Il Caparra\\\" -- The Gozzoli frescoes -- Giovanni\\nde' Medici (di Bicci) -- Cosimo de' Medici -- The first banishment -- Piero\\nde' Medici -- Lorenzo de' Medici -- Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici -- The\\nsecond banishment -- Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici -- Leo X -- Lorenzo di\\nPiero di Lorenzo de' Medici -- Clement VII -- Third banishment of the\\nMedici -- The siege of Florence -- Alessandro de' Medici -- Ippolito de'\\nMedici -- Lorenzino de' Medici -- Giovanni delle Bande Nere -- Cosimo I -- The\\nGrand Dukes.\\n\\nThe natural step from the Baptistery would be to the Uffizi. But for\\nus not yet; because in order to understand Florence, and particularly\\nthe Florence that existed between the extreme dates that I have chosen\\nas containing the fascinating period -- namely 1296, when the Duomo was\\nbegun, and 1564, when Michelangelo died -- one must understand who and\\nwhat the Medici were.\\n\\nWhile I have been enjoying the pleasant task of writing this\\nbook -- which has been more agreeable than any literary work I have ever\\ndone -- I have continually been conscious of a plaintive voice at my\\nshoulder, proceeding from one of the vigilant and embarrassing imps\\nwho sit there and do duty as conscience, inquiring if the time is not\\nabout ripe for introducing that historical sketch of Florence without\\nwhich no account such as this can be rightly understood. And ever I\\nhave replied with words of a soothing and procrastinating nature. But\\nnow that we are face to face with the Medici family, in their very\\nhouse, I am conscious that the occasion for that historical sketch\\nis here indeed, and equally I am conscious of being quite incapable\\nof supplying it. For the history of Florence between, say the birth\\nof Giotto or Dante and the return of Cosimo de' Medici from exile,\\nwhen the absolute Medici rule began, is so turbulent, crowded, and\\ncomplex that it would require the whole of this volume to describe\\nit. The changes in the government of the city would alone occupy a\\ngood third, so constant and complicated were they. I should have to\\nexplain the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, the Neri and the Bianchi,\\nthe Guilds and the Priors, the gonfalonieri and the podesta, the\\nsecondo popolo and the buonuomini.\\n\\nRather than do this imperfectly I have chosen to do it not at all;\\nand the curious must resort to historians proper. But there is at\\nthe end of the volume a table of the chief dates in Florentine and\\nEuropean history in the period chosen, together with births and deaths\\nof artists and poets and other important persons, so that a bird's-eye\\nview of the progress of affairs can be quickly gained, while in this\\nchapter I offer an outline of the great family of rulers of Florence\\nwho made the little city an aesthetic lawgiver to the world and with\\nwhom her later fame, good or ill, is indissolubly united. For the rest,\\nis there not the library?\\n\\nThe Medici, once so powerful and stimulating, are still ever in the\\nbackground of Florence as one wanders hither and thither. They are\\nbehind many of the best pictures and most of the best statues. Their\\nescutcheon is everywhere. I ought, I believe, to have made them\\nthe subject of my first chapter. But since I did not, let us without\\nfurther delay turn to the Via Cavour, which runs away to the north from\\nthe Baptistery, being a continuation of the Via de' Martelli, and pause\\nat the massive and dignified palace at the first corner on the left.\\nFor that is the Medici's home; and afterwards we will step into\\nS. Lorenzo and see the church which Brunelleschi and Donatello made\\nbeautiful and Michelangelo wonderful that the Medici might lie there.\\n\\nVisitors go to the Riccardi palace rather to see Gozzoli's frescoes\\nthan anything else; and indeed apart from the noble solid Renaissance\\narchitecture of Michelozzo there is not much else to see. In the\\ncourtyard are certain fragments of antique sculpture arranged against\\nthe walls, and a sarcophagus is shown in which an early member of the\\nfamily, Guccio de' Medici, who was gonfalonier in 1299, once reposed.\\nThere too are Donatello's eight medallions, but they are not very\\ninteresting, being only enlarged copies of old medals and cameos and\\nnot notable for his own characteristics.\\n\\nHence it is that, after Gozzoli, by far the most interesting\\npart of this building is its associations. For here lived Cosimo\\nde' Medici, whose building of the palace was interrupted by his\\nbanishment as a citizen of dangerous ambition; here lived Piero\\nde' Medici, for whom Gozzoli worked; here was born and here lived\\nLorenzo the Magnificent. To this palace came the Pazzi conspirators\\nto lure Giuliano to the Duomo and his doom. Here did Charles\\nVIII -- Savonarola's \\\"Flagellum Dei\\\" -- lodge and loot, and it was here\\nthat Capponi frightened him with the threat of the Florentine bells;\\nhither came in 1494 the fickle and terrible Florentine mob, always\\npassionate in its pursuit of change and excitement, and now inflamed\\nby the sermons of Savonarola, to destroy the priceless manuscripts\\nand works of art; here was brought up for a year or so the little\\nCatherine de' Medici, and next door was the house in which Alessandro\\nde' Medici was murdered.\\n\\nIt was in the seventeenth century that the palace passed to the\\nRiccardi family, who made many additions. A century later Florence\\nacquired it, and to-day it is the seat of the Prefect of the\\ncity. Cosimo's original building was smaller; but much of it remains\\nuntouched. The exquisite cornice is Michelozzo's original, and the\\ncourtyard has merely lost its statues, among which are Donatello's\\nJudith, now in the Loggia de' Lanzi, and his bronze David, now in the\\nBargello, while Verrocchio's David was probably on the stairs. The\\nescutcheon on the corner of the house gives us the period of its\\nerection. The seven plain balls proclaim it Cosimo's. Each of\\nthe Medici sported these palle, although each had also his private\\ncrest. Under Giovanni, Cosimo's father, the balls were eight in number;\\nunder Cosimo, seven; under Piero, seven, with the fleur-de-lis of\\nFrance on the uppermost, given him by Louis XI; under Lorenzo, six;\\nand as one walks about Florence one can approximately fix the date of\\na building by remembering these changes. How many times they occur on\\nthe fa\\u00e7ades of Florence and its vicinity, probably no one could say;\\nbut they are everywhere. The French wits, who were amused to derive\\nCatherine de' Medici from a family of apothecaries, called them pills.\\n\\nThe beautiful lantern at the corner was added by Lorenzo and was\\nthe work of an odd ironsmith in Florence for whom he had a great\\nliking -- Niccol\\u00f2 Grosso. For Lorenzo had all that delight in character\\nwhich belongs so often to the born patron and usually to the born\\nconnoisseur. This Grosso was a man of humorous independence and\\nbluntness. He had the admirable custom of carrying out his commissions\\nin the order in which they arrived, so that if he was at work upon a\\nset of fire-irons for a poor client, not even Lorenzo himself (who as\\na matter of fact often tried) could induce him to turn to something\\nmore lucrative. The rich who cannot wait he forced to wait. Grosso\\nalso always insisted upon something in advance and payment on\\ndelivery, and pleasantly described his workshop as being the Sign\\nof the Burning Books, -- since if his books were burnt how could he\\nenter a debt? This rule earned for him from Lorenzo the nickname of\\n\\\"Il Caparra\\\" (earnest money). Another of Grosso's eccentricities was\\nto refuse to work for Jews.\\n\\nWithin the palace, up stairs, is the little chapel which Gozzoli made\\nso gay and fascinating that it is probably the very gem among the\\nprivate chapels of the world. Here not only did the Medici perform\\ntheir devotions -- Lorenzo's corner seat is still shown, and anyone\\nmay sit in it -- but their splendour and taste are reflected on the\\nwalls. Cosimo, as we shall see when we reach S. Marco, invited Fra\\nAngelico to paint upon the walls of that convent sweet and simple\\nfrescoes to the glory of God. Piero employed Fra Angelico's pupil,\\nBenozzo Gozzoli to decorate this chapel.\\n\\nIn the year 1439, as chapter II related, through the instrumentality\\nof Cosimo a great episcopal Council was held at Florence, at which\\nJohn Palaeologus, Emperor of the East, met Pope Eugenius IV. In that\\nyear Cosimo's son Piero was twenty-three, and Gozzoli nineteen,\\nand probably upon both, but certainly on the young artist, such\\npomp and splendour and gorgeousness of costume as then were visible\\nin Florence made a deep impression. When therefore Piero, after\\nbecoming head of the family, decided to decorate the chapel with\\na procession of Magi, it is not surprising that the painter should\\nrecall this historic occasion. We thus get the pageantry of the East\\nwith more than common realism, while the portraits, or at any rate\\nrepresentations, of the Patriarch of Constantinople (the first king)\\nand the Emperor (the second king) are here, together with those of\\ncertain Medici, for the youthful third king is none other than Piero's\\neldest son Lorenzo. Among their followers are (the third on the left)\\nCosimo de' Medici, who is included as among the living, although,\\nlike the Patriarch of Constantinople, he was dead, and his brother\\nLorenzo (the middle one of the three), whose existence is forgotten\\nso completely until the accession of Cosimo I, in 1537, brings his\\nbranch of the family into power; while on the right is Piero de'\\nMedici himself. Piero's second son Giuliano is on the white horse,\\npreceded by a negro carrying his bow. The head immediately above\\nGiuliano I do not know, but that one a little to the left above it\\nis Gozzoli's own. Among the throng are men of learning who either\\ncame to Florence from the East or Florentines who assimilated their\\nphilosophy -- such as Georgius Gemisthos, Marsilio Ficino, and perhaps\\ncertain painters among them, all prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9s of Cosimo and Piero, and\\nall makers of the Renaissance.\\n\\nThe assemblage alone, apart altogether from any beauty and charm\\nthat the painting possesses, makes these frescoes valuable. But the\\npainting is a delight. We have a pretty Gozzoli in our National\\nGallery -- No. 283 -- but it gives no indication of the ripeness and\\nrichness and incident of this work; while the famous Biblical\\nseries in the Campo Santo of Pisa has so largely perished as to be\\nscarcely evidence to his colour. The first impression made by the\\nMedici frescoes is their sumptuousness. When Gozzoli painted -- if the\\nstory be true -- he had only candle light: the window over the altar\\nis new. But think of candle light being all the illumination of these\\nwalls as the painter worked! A new door and window have also been cut\\nin the wall opposite the altar close to the three daughters of Piero,\\nby vandal hands; and \\\"Bruta, bruta!\\\" says the guardian, very rightly.\\n\\nThe landscape behind the procession is hardly less interesting than the\\nprocession itself; but it is when we come to the meadows of paradise,\\nwith the angels and roses, the cypresses and birds, in the two chancel\\nscenes, that this side of Gozzoli's art is most fascinating. He has\\ntravelled a long way from his master Fra Angelico here: the heaven\\nis of the visible rather than the invisible eye; sense is present\\nas well as the rapturous spirit. The little Medici who endured the\\ntedium of the services here are to be felicitated with upon such an\\nadorable presentment of glory. With plenty of altar candles the sight\\nof these gardens of the blest must have beguiled many a mass. Thinking\\nhere in England upon the Medici chapel, I find that the impression\\nit has left upon me is chiefly cypresses -- cypresses black and comely,\\ndisposed by a master hand, with a glint of gold among them.\\n\\nThe picture that was over the altar has gone. It was a Lippo Lippi\\nand is now in Berlin.\\n\\nThe first of the Medici family to rise to the highest power was\\nGiovanni d'Averardo de' Medici (known as Giovanni di Bicci), 1360-1429,\\nwho, a wealthy banker living in what is now the Piazza del Duomo,\\nwas well known for his philanthropy and interest in the welfare of\\nthe Florentines, but does not come much into public notice until\\n1401, when he was appointed one of the judges in the Baptistery door\\ncompetition. He was a retiring, watchful man. Whether he was personally\\nambitious is not too evident, but he was opposed to tyranny and was the\\nsteady foe of the Albizzi faction, who at that time were endeavouring\\nto obtain supreme power in Florentine affairs. In 1419 Giovanni\\nincreased his popularity by founding the Spedale degli Innocenti,\\nand in 1421 he was elected gonfalonier, or, as we might now say,\\nPresident of the Republic. In this capacity he made his position\\nsecure and reduced the nobles (chief of whom was Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano)\\nto political weakness. Giovanni died in 1429, leaving one son, Cosimo,\\naged forty, a second, Lorenzo, aged thirtyfour, a fragrant memory\\nand an immense fortune.\\n\\nTo Lorenzo, who remained a private citizen, we shall return in time;\\nit is Cosimo (1389-1464) with whom we are now concerned. Cosimo de'\\nMedici was a man of great mental and practical ability: he had been\\neducated as well as possible; he had a passion both for art and\\nletters; he inherited his father's financial ability and generosity,\\nwhile he added to these gifts a certain genius for the management\\nof men. One of the first things that Cosimo did after his father's\\ndeath was to begin the palace where we now are, rejecting a plan by\\nBrunelleschi as too splendid, and choosing instead one by Michelozzo,\\nthe partner of Donatello, two artists who remained his personal\\nfriends through life. Cosimo selected this site, in what was then\\nthe Via Larga but is now the Via Cavour, partly because his father\\nhad once lived there, and partly because it was close to S. Lorenzo,\\nwhich his father, with six other families, had begun to rebuild,\\na work he intended himself to carry on.\\n\\nThe palace was begun in 1430 abd was still in progress in 1433 when\\nthe Albizzi, who had always viewed the rise of the Medici family\\nwith apprehension and misgiving, and were now strengthened by the\\ndeath of Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano, who, though powerful, had been a very\\ncautious and temperate adviser, succeeded in getting a majority\\nin the Signoria and passing a sentence of banishment on the whole\\nMedici tribe as being too rich and ambitious to be good citizens of\\na simple and frugal Republic. Cosimo therefore, after some days of\\nimprisonment in the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, during which he\\nexpected execution at any moment, left Florence for Venice, taking\\nhis architect with him. In 1434, however, the Florentines, realizing\\nthat under the Albizzi they were losing their independence, and what\\nwas to be a democracy was become an oligarchy, revolted, and Cosimo\\nwas recalled, and, like his father, was elected gonfalonier. With this\\nrecall began his long supremacy; for he returned like a king and like\\na king remained, quickly establishing himself as the leading man in\\nthe city, the power behind the Signoria. Not only did he never lose\\nthat position, but he made it so naturally his own that when he died\\nhe was able to transmit it to his son.\\n\\nCosimo de' Medici was, I think, the wisest and best ruler that Florence\\never had and ranks high among the rulers that any state ever had. But\\nhe changed the Florentines from an independent people to a dependent\\none. In his capacity of Father of his Country he saw to it that his\\nchildren lost their proud spirit. He had to be absolute; and this\\nend he achieved in many ways, but chiefly by his wealth, which made\\nit possible to break the rich rebel and to enslave the poor. His\\ngreatest asset -- next his wealth -- was his knowledge of the Florentine\\ncharacter. To know anything of this capricious, fickle, turbulent\\nfolk even after the event was in itself a task of such magnitude that\\nalmost no one else had compassed it; but Cosimo did more, he knew what\\nthey were likely to do. By this knowledge, together with his riches,\\nhis craft, his tact, his business ramifications as an international\\nbanker, his open-handedness and air of personal simplicity, Cosimo\\nmade himself a power. For Florence could he not\\ndo enough. By inviting the Pope and the Greek Emperor to meet there\\nhe gave it great political importance, and incidentally brought\\nabout the New Learning. He established the Platonic Academy and\\nformed the first public library in the west. He rebuilt and endowed\\nthe monastery of S. Marco. He built and rebuilt other churches. He\\ngave Donatello a free hand in sculpture and Fra Lippo Lippi and Fra\\nAngelico in painting. He distributed altogether in charity and churches\\nfour hundred thousand of those golden coins which were invented by\\nFlorence and named florins after her -- a sum equal to a million pounds\\nof to-day. In every direction one comes upon traces of his generosity\\nand thoroughness. After his death it was decided that as Pater Patriae,\\nor Father of his Country, he should be for ever known.\\n\\nCosimo died in 1464, leaving an invalid son, Piero, aged forty-eight,\\nknown for his almost continuous gout as Il Gottoso. Giovanni and Cosimo\\nhad had to work for their power; Piero stepped naturally into it,\\nalthough almost immediately he had to deal with a plot -- the first for\\nthirty years -- to ruin the Medici prestige, the leader of which was that\\nLuca Pitti who began the Pitti palace in order to have a better house\\nthan the Medici. The plot failed, not a little owing to young Lorenzo\\nde' Medici's address, and the remaining few years of Piero's life were\\ntranquil. He was a quiet, kindly man with the traditional family love\\nof the arts, and it was for him that Gozzoli worked. He died in 1469,\\nleaving two sons, Lorenzo (1449-1492) and Giuliano (1453-1478).\\n\\nLorenzo had been brought up as the future leading citizen of Florence:\\nhe had every advantage of education and environment, and was rich in\\nthe aristocratic spirit which often blossoms most richly in the second\\nor third generation of wealthy business families. Giovanni had been\\na banker before everything, Cosimo an administrator, Piero a faithful\\ninheritor of his father's wishes; it was left for Lorenzo to be the\\nfirst poet and natural prince of the Medici blood. Lorenzo continued\\nto bank but mismanaged the work and lost heavily; while his poetical\\ntendencies no doubt distracted his attention generally from affairs.\\nYet such was his sympathetic understanding and his native splendour and\\ngift of leadership that he could not but be at the head of everything,\\nthe first to be consulted and ingratiated. Not only was he the first\\nMedici poet but the first of the family to marry not for love but\\nfor policy, and that too was a sign of decadence.\\n\\nLorenzo came into power when only twenty, and at the age of forty-two\\nhe was dead, but in the interval, by his interest in every kind of\\nintellectual and artistic activity, by his passion for the greatness\\nand glory of Florence, he made for himself a name that must always\\nconnote liberality, splendour, and enlightenment. But it is beyond\\nquestion that under Lorenzo the Florentines changed deeply and for\\nthe worse. The old thrift and simplicity gave way to extravagance and\\nostentation; the old faith gave way too, but that was not wholly the\\neffect of Lorenzo's natural inclination towards Platonic philosophy,\\nfostered by his tutor Marsilio Ficino and his friends Poliziano and\\nPico della Mirandola, but was due in no small measure also to the\\nhostility of Pope Sixtus, which culminated in the Pazzi Conspiracy of\\n1478 and the murder of Giuliano. Looking at the history of Florence\\nfrom our present vantage-point we can see that although under\\nLorenzo the Magnificent she was the centre of the world's culture\\nand distinction, there was behind this dazzling front no seriousness\\nof purpose. She was in short enjoying the fruits of her labours as\\nthough the time of rest had come; and this when strenuousness was more\\nthan ever important. Lorenzo carried on every good work of his father\\nand grandfather (he spent \\u00a365,000 a year in books alone) and was as\\njealous of Florentine interests; but he was also \\\"The Magnificent,\\\"\\nand in that lay the peril. Florence could do with wealth and power,\\nbut magnificence went to her head.\\n\\nLorenzo died in 1492, leaving three sons, of whom the eldest, Piero\\n(1471-1503), succeeded him. Never was such a decadence. In a moment\\nthe Medici prestige, which had been steadily growing under Cosimo,\\nPiero, and Lorenzo until it was world famous, crumbled to dust. Piero\\nwas a coarse-minded, pleasure-loving youth -- \\\"The Headstrong\\\" his\\nfather had called him -- whose one idea of power was to be sensual and\\ntyrannical; and the enemies of Florence and of Italy took advantage\\nof this fact. Savonarola's sermons had paved the way from within\\ntoo. In 1494 Charles VIII of France marched into Italy; Piero pulled\\nhimself together and visited the king to make terms for Florence,\\nbut made such terms that on returning to the city he found an order\\nof banishment and obeyed it. On November 9th, 1494, he and his family\\nwere expelled, and the mob, forgetting so quickly all that they owed\\nto the Medici who had gone before, rushed to this beautiful palace and\\nlooted it. The losses that art and learning sustained in a few hours\\ncan never be estimated. A certain number of treasures were subsequently\\ncollected again, such as Donatello's David and Verrocchio's David,\\nwhile Donatello's Judith was removed to the Palazzo Vecchio, where\\nan inscription was placed upon it saying that her short way with\\nHolofernes was a warning to all traitors; but priceless pictures,\\nsculpture, and MSS. were ruthlessly demolished.\\n\\nIn the chapter on S. Marco we shall read of what experiments in\\ngovernment the Florentines substituted for that of the Medici,\\nSavonarola for a while being at the head of the government, although\\nonly for a brief period which ended amid an orgy of lawlessness; and\\nthen, after a restless period of eighteen years, in which Florence\\nhad every claw cut and was weakened also by dissension, the Medici\\nreturned -- the change being the work of Lorenzo's second son, Giovanni\\nde' Medici, who on the eve of becoming Pope Leo X procured their\\nreinstatement, thus justifying the wisdom of his father in placing\\nhim in the Church. Piero having been drowned long since, his admirable\\nbut ill-starred brother Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, now thirty-three,\\nassumed the control, always under Leo X; while their cousin, Giulio,\\nalso a Churchman, and the natural son of the murdered Giuliano,\\nwas busy, behind the scenes, with the family fortunes.\\n\\nGiuliano lived only till 1516 and was succeeded by his nephew\\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, a son of Peiro, a young man of no more\\npolitical use than his father, and one who quickly became almost\\nequally unpopular. Things indeed were going so badly that Leo X sent\\nGiulio de' Medici (now a cardinal) from Rome to straighten them out,\\nand by some sensible repeals he succeeded in allaying a little of\\nthe bitterness in the city. Lorenzo had one daughter, born in this\\npalace, who was destined to make history -- Catherine de' Medici -- and\\nno son. When therefore he died in 1519, at the age of twenty-seven,\\nafter a life of vicious selfishness (which, however, was no bar\\nto his having the noblest tomb in the world, at S. Lorenzo), the\\nsuccession should have passed to the other branch of the Medici\\nfamily, the descendants of old Giovanni's second son Lorenzo,\\nbrother of Cosimo. But Giulio, at Rome, always at the ear of the\\nindolent, pleasure-loving Leo X, had other projects. Born in 1478,\\nthe illegitimate son of a charming father, Giulio had none of the\\ngreat Medici traditions, and the Medici name never stood so low as\\nduring his period of power. Himself illegitimate, he was the father\\nof an illegitimate son, Alessandro, for whose advancement he toiled\\nmuch as Alexander VI had toiled for that of Caesar Borgia. He had not\\nthe black, bold wickedness of Alexander VI, but as Pope Clement VII,\\nwhich he became in 1523, he was little less admirable. He was cunning,\\nambitious, and tyrannical, and during his pontificate he contrived not\\nonly to make many powerful enemies and to see both Rome and Florence\\nunder siege, but to lose England for the Church.\\n\\nWe move, however, too fast. The year is 1519 and Lorenzo is dead,\\nand the rightful heir to the Medici wealth and power was to be\\nkept out. To do this Giulio himself moved to Florence and settled\\nin the Medici palace, and on his return to Rome Cardinal Passerini\\nwas installed in the Medici palace in his stead, nominally as the\\ncustodian of little Catherine de' Medici and Ippolito, a boy of ten,\\nthe illegitimate son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours. That Florence\\nshould have put up with this Roman control shows us how enfeebled\\nwas her once proud spirit. In 1521 Leo X died, to be succeeded, in\\nspite of all Giulio's efforts, by Adrian of Utrecht, as Adrian VI,\\na good, sincere man who, had he lived, might have enormously changed\\nthe course not only of Italian but of English history. He survived,\\nhowever, for less than two years, and then came Giulio's chance,\\nand he was elected Pope Clement VII.\\n\\nClement's first duty was to make Florence secure, and he therefore\\nsent his son Alessandro, then about thirteen, to join the others\\nat the Medici palace, which thus now contained a resident cardinal,\\nwatchful of Medici interests; a legitimate daughter of Lorenzo, Duke\\nof Urbino (but owing to quarrels she was removed to a convent); an\\nillegitimate son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, the nominal heir and\\nalready a member of the Government; and the Pope's illegitimate son,\\nof whose origin, however, nothing was said, although it was implied\\nthat Lorenzo, Duke of Nemours, was his father.\\n\\nThis was the state of affairs during Clement's war with the Emperor\\nCharles V, which ended with the siege of Rome and the imprisonment\\nof the Pope in the Castle of S. Angelo for some months until he\\ncontrived to escape to Orvieto; and meanwhile Florence, realizing his\\npowerlessness, uttered a decree again banishing the Medici family, and\\nin 1527 they were sent forth from the city for the third time. But even\\nnow, when the move was so safe, Florence lacked courage to carry it\\nout until a member of the Medici family, furious at the presence of the\\nbase-born Medici in the palace, and a professed hater of her base-born\\nuncle Clement VII and all his ways -- Clarice Strozzi, n\\u00e9e Clarice de'\\nMedici, granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent -- came herself to this\\nhouse and drove the usurpers from it with her extremely capable tongue.\\n\\nTo explain clearly the position of the Florentine Republic at this\\ntime would be too deeply to delve into history, but it may briefly be\\nsaid that by means of humiliating surrenders and much crafty diplomacy,\\nClement VII was able to bring about in 1529 peace between the Emperor\\nCharles V and Francis I of France, by which Charles was left master\\nof Italy, while his partner and ally in these transactions, Clement,\\nexpected for his own share certain benefits in which the humiliation\\nof Florence and the exaltation of Alessandro came first. Florence,\\nhaving taken sides with Francis, found herself in any case very badly\\nleft, with the result that at the end of 1529 Charles V's army, with\\nthe papal forces to assist, laid siege to her. The siege lasted for\\nten months, in which the city was most ably defended by Ferrucci,\\nthat gallant soldier whose portrait by Piero di Cosimo is in our\\nNational Gallery -- No. 895 -- and then came a decisive battle in which\\nthe Emperor and Pope were conquerors, a thousand brave Florentines\\nwere put to death and others were imprisoned.\\n\\nAlessandro de' Medici arrived at the Medici palace in 1531, and\\nin 1532 the glorious Florentine Republic of so many years' growth,\\nfor the establishment of which so much good blood had been spilt, was\\ndeclared to be at an end. Alessandro being proclaimed Duke, his first\\nact was to order the demolition of the great bell of the Signoria which\\nhad so often called the citizens to arms or meetings of independence.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ippolito, the natural son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, and\\ntherefore the rightful heir, after having been sent on various missions\\nby Clement VII, to keep him out of the way, settled at Bologna and took\\nto poetry. He was a kindly, melancholy man with a deep sense of human\\ninjustice; and in 1535, when, after Clement VII's very welcome demise,\\nthe Florentine exiles who either had been banished from Florence by\\nAlessandro or had left of their own volition rather than live in the\\ncity under such a contemptible ruler, sent an embassy to the Emperor\\nCharles V to help them against this new tyrant, Ippolito headed it;\\nbut Alessandro prudently arranged for his assassination en route.\\n\\nIt is unlikely, however, that the Emperor would have done anything,\\nfor in the following year he allowed his daughter Margaret to become\\nAlessandro's wife. That was in 1536. In January, 1537, Lorenzino de'\\nMedici, a cousin, one of the younger branch of the family, assuming\\nthe mantle of Brutus, or liberator, stabbed Alessandro to death while\\nhe was keeping an assignation in the house that then adjoined this\\npalace. Thus died, at the age of twenty-six, one of the most worthless\\nof men, and, although illegitimate, the last of the direct line of\\nCosimo de' Medici, the Father of his Country, to govern Florence.\\n\\nThe next ruler came from the younger branch, to which we now turn. Old\\nGiovanni di Bicci had two sons, Cosimo and Lorenzo. Lorenzo's son, Pier\\nFrancesco de' Medici, had a son Giovanni de' Medici. This Giovanni,\\nwho married Caterina Sforza of Milan, had also a son named Giovanni,\\nborn in 1498, and it was he who was the rightful heir when Lorenzo,\\nDuke of Urbino, died in 1519. He was connected with both sides of\\nthe family, for his father, as I have said, was the great grandson\\nof the first Medici on our list, and his wife was Maria Salviati,\\ndaughter of Lucrezia de' Medici -- herself a daughter of Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent -- and Jacopo Salviati, a wealthy Florentine. When, however,\\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, died in 1519, Giovanni was a young man of\\ntwenty-one with an absorbing passion for fighting, which Clement VII\\n(then Giulio) was only too keen to foster, since he wished him out of\\nthe way in order that his own projects for the ultimate advancement\\nof the base-born Alessandro, and meanwhile of the catspaw, the\\nbase-born Ippolito, might be furthered. Giovanni had already done\\nsome good service in the field, was becoming famous as the head of\\nhis company of Black Bands, and was known as Giovanni delle Bande\\nNere; and his marriage to his cousin Maria Salviati and the birth\\nof his only son Cosimo in 1519 made no difference to his delight\\nin warfare. He was happy only when in the field of battle, and the\\nstruggle between Francis and Charles gave him ample opportunities,\\nfighting on the side of Charles and the Pope and doing many brave and\\ndashing things. He died at an early age, only twenty-eight, in 1526,\\nthe idol of his men, leaving a widow and child in poverty.\\n\\nAlmost immediately afterwards came the third banishment of the Medici\\nfamily from Florence. Giovanni's widow and their son Cosimo got\\nalong as best they could until the murder of Alessandro in 1537,\\nwhen Cosimo was nearly eighteen. He was a quiet, reserved youth,\\nwho had apparently taken but little interest in public affairs, and\\nhad spent his time in the country with his mother, chiefly in field\\nsports. But no sooner was Alessandro dead, and his slayer Lorenzino\\nhad escaped, than Cosimo approached the Florentine council and claimed\\nto be appointed to his rightful place as head of the State, and this\\nclaim he put, or suggested, with so much humility that his wish was\\ngranted. Instantly one of the most remarkable transitions in history\\noccurred: the youth grew up almost in a day and at once began to exert\\nunsuspected reserves of power and authority. In despair a number of\\nthe chief Florentines made an effort to depose him, and a battle was\\nfought at Montemurlo, a few miles from Florence, between Cosimo's\\ntroops, fortified by some French allies, and the insurgents. That\\nwas in 1537; the victory fell to Cosimo; and his long and remarkable\\nreign began with the imprisonment and execution of the chief rebels.\\n\\nAlthough Cosimo made so bloody a beginning he was the first imaginative\\nand thoughtful administrator that Florence had had since Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent. He set himself grimly to build upon the ruins which the\\npast forty and more years had produced; and by the end of his reign he\\nhad worked wonders. As first he lived in the Medici palace, but after\\nmarrying a wealthy wife, Eleanora of Toledo, he transferred his home\\nto the Signoria, now called the Palazzo Vecchio, as a safer spot, and\\nestablished a bodyguard of Swiss lancers in Orcagna's loggia, close\\nby. Later he bought the unfinished Pitti palace with his wife's\\nmoney, finished it, and moved there. Meanwhile he was strengthening\\nhis position in every way by alliances and treaties, and also by the\\nconvenient murder of Lorenzino, the Brutus who had rid Florence of\\nAlessandro ten years earlier, and whose presence in the flesh could\\nnot but be a cause of anxiety since Lorenzino derived from an elder\\nson of the Medici, and Cosimo from a younger. In 1555 the ancient\\nrepublic of Siena fell to Cosimo's troops after a cruel and barbarous\\nsiege and was thereafter merged in Tuscany, and in 1570 Cosimo assumed\\nthe title of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and was crowned at Rome.\\n\\nWhether or not the common accusation against the Medici as a\\nfamily, that they had but one motive -- mercenary ambition and\\nself-aggrandisement -- is true, the fact remains that the crown did\\nnot reach their brows until one hundred and seventy years from the\\nfirst appearance of old Giovanni di Bicci in Florentine affairs. The\\nstatue of Cosimo I in the Piazza della Signoria has a bas-relief of\\nhis coronation. He was then fifty-one; he lived but four more years,\\nand when he died he left a dukedom flourishing in every way: rich,\\npowerful, busy, and enlightened. He had developed and encouraged\\nthe arts, capriciously, as Cellini's \\\"Autobiography\\\" tells us, but\\ngenuinely too, as we can see at the Uffizi and the Pitti. The arts,\\nhowever, were not what they had been, for the great period had passed\\nand Florence was in the trough of the wave. Yet Cosimo found the best\\nmen he could -- Cellini, Bronzino, and Vasari -- and kept them busy. But\\nhis greatest achievement as a connoisseur was his interest in Etruscan\\nremains and the excavations at Arezzo and elsewhere which yielded\\nthe priceless relics now at the Archaeological Museum.\\n\\nWith Cosimo I this swift review of the Medici family ends. The\\nrest have little interest for the visitor to Florence to-day,\\nfor whom Cellini's Perseus, made to Cosimo I's order, is the last\\ngreat artistic achievement in the city in point of time. But I may\\nsay that Cosimo I's direct descendants occupied the throne (as it\\nhad now become) until the death of Gian Gastone, son of Cosimo III,\\nwho died in 1737. Tuscany passed to Austria until 1801. In 1807 it\\nbecame French, and in 1814 Austrian again. In 1860 it was merged in\\nthe Kingdom of Italy under the rule of the monarch who has given his\\nname to the great new Piazza -- Vittorio Emmanuele.\\n\\nAfter Gian Gastone's death one other Medici remained alive: Anna\\nMaria Ludovica, daughter of Cosimo III. Born in 1667, she married\\nthe Elector Palatine of the Rhine, and survived until 1743. It was\\nshe who left to the city the priceless Medici collections, as I have\\nstated in chapter VIII. The earlier and greatest of the Medici are\\nburied in the church of S. Lorenzo or in Michelangelo's sacristy; the\\nlater Medici, beginning with Giovanni delle Bande Nere and his wife,\\nand their son Cosimo I, are in the gorgeous mausoleum that adjoins\\nS. Lorenzo and is still being enriched with precious marbles.\\n\\nSuch is an outline of the history of this wonderful family, and we\\nleave their ancient home, built by the greatest and wisest of them,\\nwith mixed feelings of admiration and pity. They were seldom lovable;\\nthey were often despicable; but where they were great they were\\nvery great indeed. A Latin inscription in the courtyard reminds the\\ntraveller of the distinction which the house possesses, calling it\\nthe home not only of princes but of knowledge herself and a treasury\\nof the arts. But Florence, although it bought the palace from the\\nRiccardi family a century and more ago, has never cared to give it\\nback its rightful name.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nS. Lorenzo and Michelangelo\\n\\nA forlorn fa\\u00e7ade -- The church of the Medici -- Cosimo's\\nparents' tomb -- Donatello's cantoria and pulpits -- Brunelleschi's\\nsacristy -- Donatello again -- The palace of the dead Grand Dukes -- Costly\\nintarsia -- Michelangelo's sacristy -- A weary Titan's life -- The victim\\nof capricious pontiffs -- The Medici tombs -- Mementi mori -- The Casa\\nBuonarroti -- Brunelleschi's cloisters -- A model library.\\n\\nArchitecturally S. Lorenzo does not attract as S. Croce and S. Maria\\nNovella do; but certain treasures of sculpture make it unique. Yet it\\nis a cool scene of noble grey arches, and the ceiling is very happily\\npicked out with gold and colour. Savonarola preached some of his most\\nimportant sermons here; here Lorenzo the Magnificent was married.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade has never yet been finished: it is just ragged brickwork\\nwaiting for its marble, and likely to wait, although such expenditure\\non marble is going on within a few yards of it as makes one gasp. Not\\nvery far away, in the Via Ghibellina, is a house which contains some\\nrough plans by a master hand for this fa\\u00e7ade, drawn some four hundred\\nyears ago -- the hand of none other than Michelangelo, whose scheme\\nwas to make it not only a wonder of architecture but a wonder also\\nof statuary, the fa\\u00e7ade having many niches, each to be filled with\\na sacred figure. But Michelangelo always dreamed on a scale utterly\\ndisproportionate to the foolish little span of life allotted to us\\nand the S. Lorenzo fa\\u00e7ade was never even begun.\\n\\nThe piazza which these untidy bricks overlook is now given up to stalls\\nand is the centre of the cheap clothing district. Looking diagonally\\nacross it from the church one sees the great walls of the courtyard\\nof what is now the Riccardi palace, but was in the great days the\\nMedici palace; and at the corner, facing the Borgo S. Lorenzo, is\\nGiovanni delle Bande Nere, in stone, by the impossible Bandinelli,\\nlooking at least twenty years older than he ever lived to be.\\n\\nS. Lorenzo was a very old church in the time of Giovanni de' Medici,\\nthe first great man of the family, and had already been restored\\nonce, in the eleventh century, but it was his favourite church,\\nchosen by him for his own resting-place, and he spent great sums\\nin improving it. All this with the assistance of Brunelleschi, who\\nis responsible for the interior as we now see it, and would, had he\\nlived, have completed the fa\\u00e7ade. After Giovanni came Cosimo, who also\\ndevoted great sums to the glory of this church, not only assisting\\nBrunelleschi with his work but inducing Donatello to lavish his genius\\nupon it; and the church was thus established as the family vault of\\nthe Medici race. Giovanni lies here; Cosimo lies here; and Piero;\\nwhile Lorenzo the Magnificent and Giuliano and certain descendants\\nwere buried in the Michelangelo sacristy, and all the Grand Dukes in\\nthe ostentatious chapel behind the altar.\\n\\nCosimo is buried beneath the floor in front of the high altar,\\nin obedience to his wish, and by the special permission of the\\nRoman Church; and in the same vault lies Donatello. Cosimo, who\\nwas buried with all simplicity on August 22nd, 1464, in his last\\nillness recommended Donatello, who was then seventy-eight, to his son\\nPiero. The old sculptor survived his illustrious patron and friend\\nonly two and a half years, declining gently into the grave, and his\\nbody was brought here in December, 1466. A monument to his memory\\nwas erected in the church in 1896. Piero (the Gouty), who survived\\nuntil 1469, lies close by, his bronze monument, with that of his\\nbrother, being that between the sacristy and the adjoining chapel,\\nin an imposing porphyry and bronze casket, the work of Verrocchio, one\\nof the richest and most impressive of all the memorial sculptures of\\nthe Renaissance. The marble pediment is supported by four tortoises,\\nsuch as support the monoliths in the Piazza S. Maria Novella. The\\niron rope work that divides the sacristy from the chapel is a marvel\\nof workmanship.\\n\\nBut we go too fast: the church before the sacristy, and the glories of\\nthe church are Donatello's. We have seen his cantoria in the Museum of\\nthe Cathedral. Here is another, not so riotous and jocund in spirit,\\nbut in its own way hardly less satisfying. The Museum cantoria has\\nthe wonderful frieze of dancing figures; this is an exercise in\\nmarble intarsia. It has the same row of pillars with little specks\\nof mosaic gold; but its beauty is that of delicate proportions and\\nsoft tones. The cantoria is in the left aisle, in its original place;\\nthe two bronze pulpits are in the nave. These have a double interest\\nas being not only Donatello's work but his latest work. They were\\nincomplete at his death, and were finished by his pupil Bertoldo\\n(1410-1491), and since, as we shall see, Bertoldo became the master of\\nMichelangelo, when he was a lad of fifteen and Bertoldo an old man of\\neighty, these pulpits may be said to form a link between the two great\\nS. Lorenzo sculptors. How fine and free and spirited Bertoldo could\\nbe, alone, we shall see at the Bargello. The S. Lorenzo pulpits are\\nvery difficult to study: nothing wants a stronger light than a bronze\\nrelief, and in Florence students of bronze reliefs are accustomed\\nto it, since the most famous of all -- the Ghiberti doors -- are in the\\nopen air. Only in course of time can one discern the scenes here. The\\nleft pulpit is the finer, for it contains the \\\"Crucifixion\\\" and the\\n\\\"Deposition,\\\" which to me form the most striking of the panels.\\n\\nThe other piece of sculpture in the church itself is a ciborium\\nby Desiderio da Settignano, in the chapel at the end of the\\nright transept -- an exquisite work by this rare and playful and\\ndistinguished hand. It is fitting that Desiderio should be here, for\\nhe was Donatello's favourite pupil. The S. Lorenzo ciborium is wholly\\ncharming, although there is a \\\"Deposition\\\" upon it; the little Boy is\\nadorable; but one sees it with the greatest difficulty owing to the\\ncrowded state of the altar and the dim light. The altar picture in\\nthe Martelli chapel, where the sympathetic Donatello monument (in the\\nsame medium as his \\\"Annunciation\\\" at S. Croce) is found -- on the way to\\nthe Library -- is by Lippo Lippi, and is notable for the pretty Virgin\\nreceiving the angel's news. There is nice colour in the predella.\\n\\nAs I have said in the first chapter, we are too prone to ignore the\\narchitect. We look at the jewels and forget the casket. Brunelleschi is\\na far greater maker of Florence than either Donatello or Michelangelo;\\nbut one thinks of him rather as an abstraction than a man or forgets\\nhim altogether. Yet the S. Lorenzo sacristy is one of the few perfect\\nthings in the world. What most people, however, remember is its tombs,\\nits doors, and its reliefs; the proportions escape them. I think its\\nshallow easy dome beyond description beautiful. Brunelleschi, who had\\nan investigating genius, himself painted the quaint constellations in\\nthe ceiling over the altar. At the Pazzi chapel we shall find similar\\narchitecture; but there extraneous colour was allowed to come in. Here\\nsuch reliefs as were admitted are white too.\\n\\nThe tomb under the great marble and porphyry table in the centre is\\nthat of Giovanni di Bicci, the father, and Piccarda, the mother, of\\nCosimo Pater, and is usually attributed to Buggiano, the adopted son\\nof Brunelleschi, but other authorities give it either to Donatello\\nalone or to Donatello with Michelozzo: both from the evidence of\\nthe design and because it is unlikely that Cosimo would ask any one\\nelse than one of these two friends of his to carry out a commission\\nso near his heart. The table is part of the scheme and not a chance\\ncovering. I think the porphyry centre ought to be movable, so that\\nthe beautiful flying figures on the sarcophagus could be seen. But\\nDonatello's most striking achievement here is the bronze doors, which\\nare at once so simple and so strong and so surprising by the activity\\nof the virile and spirited holy men, all converting each other, thereon\\ndepicted. These doors could not well be more different from Ghiberti's,\\nin the casting of which Donatello assisted; those in such high relief,\\nthese so low; those so fluid and placid, and these so vigorous.\\n\\nDonatello presides over this room (under Brunelleschi). The vivacious,\\nspeaking terra-cotta bust of the young S. Lorenzo on the altar is\\nhis; the altar railing is probably his; the frieze of terra-cotta\\ncherubs may be his; the four low reliefs in the spandrels, which it\\nis so difficult to discern but which photographs prove to be wonderful\\nscenes in the life of S. John the Evangelist -- so like, as one peers up\\nat them, plastic Piranesis, with their fine masonry -- are his. The other\\nreliefs are Donatello's too; but the lavabo in the inner sacristy is\\nVerrocchio's, and Verrocchio's tomb of Piero can never be overlooked\\neven amid such a wealth of the greater master's work.\\n\\nFrom this fascinating room -- fascinating both in itself and in its\\npossessions -- we pass, after distributing the necessary largesse to\\nthe sacristan, to a turnstile which admits, on payment of a lira,\\nto the Chapel of the Princes and to Michelangelo's sacristy. Here is\\ncontrast, indeed: the sacristy, austere and classic, and the chapel\\na very exhibition building of floridity and coloured ornateness,\\ndating from the seventeenth century and not finished yet. In paying\\nthe necessary fee to see these buildings one thinks again what the\\nfeelings of Giovanni and Cosimo and Lorenzo the Magnificent, and\\neven of Cosimo I, all such generous patrons of Florence, would be,\\nif they could see the present feverish collection of lire in their\\nbeautiful city.\\n\\nOf the Chapel of the Princes I have little to say. To pass from\\nMichelangelo's sacristy to this is an error; see it, if see it you\\nmust, first. While the fa\\u00e7ade of S. Lorenzo is still neglected and the\\ncornice of Brunelleschi's dome is still unfinished, this lapidary's\\nshow-room is being completed at a cost of millions of lire. Ever since\\n1888 has the floor been in progress, and there are many years' work\\nyet. An enthusiastic custodian gave me a list of the stones which were\\nused in the designs of the coats of arms of Tuscan cities, of which\\nthat of Fiesole is the most attractive: -- Sicily jasper, French jasper,\\nTuscany jasper, petrified wood, white and yellow, Corsican granite,\\nCorsican jasper, Oriental alabaster, French marble, lapis lazuli,\\nverde antico, African marble, Siena marble, Carrara marble, rose agate,\\nmother of pearl, and coral. The names of the Medici are in porphyry\\nand ivory. It is all very marvellous and occasionally beautiful; but...\\n\\nThis pretentious building was designed by a natural son of Cosimo\\nI in 1604, and was begun as the state mausoleum of the Grand Dukes;\\nand all lie here. All the Grand Duchesses too, save Bianca Capella,\\nwife of Francis I, who was buried none knows where. It is strange to\\nrealize as one stands here that this pavement covers all those ladies,\\nburied in their wonderful clothes. We shall see Eleanor of Toledo,\\nwife of Cosimo I, in Bronzino's famous picture at the Uffizi, in an\\namazing brocaded dress: it is that dress in which she reposes beneath\\nus! They had their jewels too, and each Grand Duke his crown and\\nsceptre; but these, with one or two exceptions, were stolen during\\nthe French occupation of Tuscany, 1801-1814. Only two of the Grand\\nDukes have their statues -- Ferdinand I and Cosimo II -- and the Medici\\nno longer exist in the Florentine memory; and yet the quiet brick\\nfloor is having all this money squandered on it to superimpose costly\\nmarbles which cannot matter to anybody.\\n\\nMichelangelo's chapel, called the New Sacristy, was begun for Leo X\\nand finished for Giulio de' Medici, illegitimate son of the murdered\\nGiuliano and afterwards Pope Clement VII. Brunelleschi's design\\nfor the Old Sacristy was followed but made more severe. This, one\\nwould feel to be the very home of dead princes even if there were no\\nstatues. The only colours are the white of the walls and the brown\\nof the pillars and windows; the dome was to have been painted, but\\nit fortunately escaped.\\n\\nThe contrast between Michelangelo's dome and Brunelleschi's is\\ncomplete -- Brunelleschi's so suave and gentle in its rise, with its\\ngrey lines to help the eye, and this soaring so boldly to its lantern,\\nwith its rigid device of dwindling squares. The odd thing is that\\nwith these two domes to teach him better the designer of the Chapel\\nof the Princes should have indulged in such floridity.\\n\\nSuch is the force of the architecture in the sacristy that one is\\nprofoundly conscious of being in melancholy's most perfect home;\\nand the building is so much a part of Michelangelo's life and it\\ncontains such marvels from his hand that I choose it as a place\\nto tell his story. Michelangelo Buonarroti was born on March 6th,\\n1475, at Caprese, of which town his father was Podest\\u00e0. At that time\\nBrunelleschi had been dead twenty-nine years, Fra Angelico twenty\\nyears, Donatello nine years, Leonardo da Vinci was twenty-three years\\nold, and Raphael was not yet born. Lorenzo the Magnificent had been\\non what was virtually the throne of Florence since 1469 and was a\\nyoung man of twenty-six. For foster-mother the child had the wife\\nof a stone-mason at Settignano, whither the family soon moved, and\\nMichelangelo used to say that it was with her milk that he imbibed\\nthe stone-cutting art. It was from the air too, for Settignano's\\nprincipal industry was sculpture. The village being only three miles\\nfrom Florence, from it the boy could see the city very much as we see\\nit now -- its Duomo, its campanile, with the same attendant spires. He\\nwas sent to Florence to school and intended for either the wool or silk\\ntrade, as so many Florentines were; but displaying artistic ability,\\nhe induced his father to apprentice him, at the age of thirteen, to\\na famous goldsmith and painter of Florence who had a busy atelier -- no\\nother than Domenico Ghirlandaio, who was then a man of thirty-nine.\\n\\nMichelangelo remained with him for three years, and although his\\npower and imagination were already greater than his master's, he\\nlearned much, and would never have made his Sixtine Chapel frescoes\\nwith the ease he did but for this early grounding. For Ghirlandaio,\\nalthough not of the first rank of painters in genius, was pre-eminently\\nthere in thoroughness, while he was good for the boy too in spirit,\\nhaving a large way with him. The first work of Ghirlandaio which\\nthe boy saw in the making was the beautiful \\\"Adoration of the Magi,\\\"\\nin the Church of the Spedale degli Innocenti, completed in 1488, and\\nthe S. Maria Novella frescoes, and it is reasonable to suppose that\\nhe helped with the frescoes in colour grinding, even if he did not,\\nas some have said, paint with his own hand the beggar sitting on the\\nsteps in the scene representing the \\\"Presentation of the Virgin\\\". That\\nhe was already clever with his pencil, we know, for he had made some\\ncaricatures and corrected a drawing or two.\\n\\nThe three years with Ghirlandaio were reduced eventually to one, the\\nboy having the good fortune to be chosen as one of enough promise to be\\nworth instruction, both by precept and example, in the famous Medici\\ngarden. Here he was more at home than in a painting room, for plastic\\nart was his passion, and not only had Lorenzo the Magnificent gathered\\ntogether there many of those masterpieces of ancient sculpture which we\\nshall see at the Uffizi, but Bertoldo, the aged head of this informal\\nschool, was the possessor of a private collection of Donatellos and\\nother Renaissance work of extraordinary beauty and worth. Donatello's\\ninfluence on the boy held long enough for him to make the low relief\\nof the Madonna, much in his style, which is now preserved in the\\nCasa Buonarroti, while the plaque of the battle of the Centaurs and\\nLapithae which is also there shows Bertoldo's influence.\\n\\nThe boy's first encounter with Lorenzo occurred while he was modelling\\nthe head of an aged faun. His magnificent patron stopped to watch him,\\npointing out that so old a creature would probably not have such a\\nfine set of teeth, and Michelangelo, taking the hint, in a moment had\\nnot only knocked out a tooth or two but -- and here his observation\\ntold -- hollowed the gums and cheeks a little in sympathy. Lorenzo\\nwas so pleased with his quickness and skill that he received him\\ninto his house as the companion of his three sons: of Piero, who\\nwas so soon and so disastrously to succeed his father, but was now a\\nhigh-spirited youth; of Giovanni, who, as Pope Leo X many years after,\\nwas to give Michelangelo the commission for this very sacristy; and\\nof Giuliano, who lies beneath one of the tombs. As their companion\\nhe enjoyed the advantage of sharing their lessons under Poliziano,\\nthe poet, and of hearing the conversation of Pico della Mirandola,\\nwho was usually with Lorenzo; and to these early fastidious and\\nintellectual surroundings the artist owed much.\\n\\nThat he read much, we know, the Bible and Dante being constant\\ncompanions; and we know also that in addition to modelling and copying\\nunder Bertoldo, he was assiduous in studying Masaccio's frescoes at\\nthe church of the Carmine across the river, which had become a school\\nof painting. It was there that his fellow-pupil, Pietro Torrigiano,\\nwho was always his enemy and a bully, broke his nose with one blow\\nand flew to Rome from the rage of Lorenzo.\\n\\nIt was when Michelangelo was seventeen that Lorenzo died, at the early\\nage of forty-two, and although the garden still existed and the Medici\\npalace was still open to the youth, the spirit had passed. Piero, who\\nsucceeded his father, had none of his ability or sagacity, and in two\\nyears was a refugee from the city, while the treasures of the garden\\nwere disposed by auction, and Michelangelo, too conspicuous as a Medici\\nprot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 to be safe, hurried away to Bologna. He was now nineteen.\\n\\nOf his travels I say nothing here, for we must keep to Florence,\\nwhither he thought it safe to return in 1495. The city was now governed\\nby the Great Council and the Medici banished. Michelangelo remained\\nonly a brief time and then went to Rome, where he made his first Piet\\u00e0,\\nat which he was working during the trial and execution of Savonarola,\\nwhom he admired and reverenced, and where he remained until 1501,\\nwhen, aged twenty-six, he returned to Florence to do some of his most\\nfamous work. The Medici were still in exile.\\n\\nIt was in August, 1501, that the authorities of the cathedral asked\\nMichelangelo to do what he could with a great block of marble on\\ntheir hands, from which he carved that statue of David of which I\\ntell the story in chapter XVI. This established his pre-eminence as\\na sculptor. Other commissions for statues poured in, and in 1504 he\\nwas invited to design a cartoon for the Palazzo Vecchio, to accompany\\none by Leonardo, and a studio was given him in the Via Guelfa for\\nthe purpose. This cartoon, when finished, so far established him\\nalso as the greatest of painters that the Masaccios in the Carmine\\nwere deserted by young artists in order that this might be studied\\ninstead. The cartoon, as I relate in the chapter on the Palazzo\\nVecchio, no longer exists.\\n\\nThe next year, 1505, Michelangelo, nearing his thirtieth birthday,\\nreturned to Rome and entered upon the second and tragic period of his\\nlife, for he arrived there only to receive the order for the Julius\\ntomb which poisoned his remaining years, and of which more is said\\nin the chapter on the Accademia, where we see so many vestiges of it\\nboth in marble and plaster. But I might remark here that this vain\\nand capricious pontiff, whose pride and indecision robbed the world\\nof no one can ever say what glorious work from Michelangelo's hand,\\nis the benevolent-looking old man whose portrait by Raphael is in\\nthe Pitti and Uffizi in colour, in the Corsini Palace in charcoal,\\nand again in our own National Gallery in colour.\\n\\nOf Michelangelo at Rome and Carrara, whither he went to superintend\\nin person the quarrying of the marble that was to be transferred to\\nlife and where he had endless vexations and mortifications, I say\\nnothing. Enough that the election of his boy friend Giovanni de'\\nMedici as Pope Leo X in 1513 brought him again to Florence, the Pope\\nhaving a strong wish that Michelangelo should complete the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nthe Medici family church, S. Lorenzo, where we now are. As we know,\\nthe scheme was not carried out, but in 1520 the Pope substituted\\nanother and more attractive one: namely, a chapel to contain the\\ntombs not only of his father the Magnificent, and his uncle, who had\\nbeen murdered in the Duomo many years before, but also his nephew\\nPiero de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, who had just died, in 1519, and\\nhis younger brother (and Michelangelo's early playmate) Giuliano de'\\nMedici, Duke of Nemours, who had died in 1516. These were not Medici\\nof the highest class, but family pride was strong. It is, however,\\nodd that no memorial of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici, who had been\\ndrowned at the age of twenty-two in 1503, was required; perhaps it\\nmay have been that since it was Piero's folly that had brought the\\nMedici into such disgrace in 1494, the less thought of him the better.\\n\\nMichelangelo took fire at once, and again hastened to Carrara to\\narrange for marble to be sent to his studio in the Via Mozzi, now the\\nVia S. Zenobi; while the building stone was brought from Fiesole. Leo\\nX lived only to know that the great man had begun, the new patron\\nbeing Giulio de' Medici, natural son of the murdered Giuliano,\\nnow a cardinal, and soon, in 1523, to become Pope Clement VII. This\\nPope showed deep interest in the project, but wished not only to add\\ntombs of himself and Pope Leo X, but also to build a library for the\\nLaurentian collection, which Michelangelo must design. A little later\\nhe had decided that he would prefer to lie in the choir of the church,\\nand Leo X with him, and instead therefore of tombs Michelangelo might\\nmerely make a colossal statue of him to stand in the piazza before the\\nchurch. The sculptor's temper had not been improved by his many years'\\nexperience of papal caprice, and he replied to this suggestion with\\na letter unique even in the annals of infuriated artists. Let the\\nstatue be made, of course, he said, but let it be useful as well as\\nornamental: the lower portion to be also a barber's shop, and the\\nhead, since it would be empty, a greengrocer's. The Pope allowed\\nhimself to be rebuked, and abandoned the statue, writing a mild and\\neven pathetic reply.\\n\\nUntil 1527 Michelangelo worked away at the building and the tombs,\\nalways secretly, behind impenetrable barriers; and then came the\\ntroubles which led to the siege of Florence, following upon the\\nbanishment of Alessandro, Duke of Urbino, natural son of the very\\nLorenzo whom the sculptor was to dignify for all time. By the Emperor\\nCharles V and Pope Clement VII the city was attacked, and Michelangelo\\nwas called away from Clement's sacristy to fortify Florence against\\nClement's soldiers. Part of his ramparts at S. Miniato still remain,\\nand he strengthened all the gates; but, feeling himself slighted and\\nhating the whole affair, he suddenly disappeared. One story is that he\\nhid in the church tower of S. Niccol\\u00f2, below what is now the Piazzale\\ndedicated to his memory. Wherever he was, he was proclaimed an outlaw,\\nand then, on Florence finding that she could not do without him,\\nwas pardoned, and so returned, the city meanwhile having surrendered\\nand the Medici again being restored to power.\\n\\nThe Pope showed either fine magnanimity or compounded with facts\\nin the interest of the sacristy; for he encouraged Michelangelo to\\nproceed, and the pacific work was taken up once more after the martial\\ninterregnum, and in a desultory way he was busy at it, always secretly\\nand moodily, until 1533, when he tired completely and never touched\\nit again. A year later Clement VII died, having seen only drawings\\nof the tombs, if those.\\n\\nBut though left unfinished, the sacristy is wholly satisfying -- more\\nindeed than satisfying, conquering. Whatever help Michelangelo may\\nhave had from his assistants, it is known that the symbolical figures\\non the tombs and the two seated Medici are from his hand. Of the two\\nfinished or practically finished tombs -- to my mind as finished as they\\nshould be -- that of Lorenzo is the finer. The presentment of Lorenzo in\\narmour brooding and planning is more splendid than that of Giuliano;\\nwhile the old man, whose head anticipates everything that is considered\\nmost original in Rodin's work, is among the best of Michelangelo's\\nstatuary. Much speculation has been indulged in as to the meaning\\nof the symbolism of these tombs, and having no theory of my own to\\noffer, I am glad to borrow Mr. Gerald S. Davies' summary from his\\nmonograph on Michelangelo. The figure of Giuliano typifies energy\\nand leadership in repose; while the man on his tomb typifies Day and\\nthe woman Night, or the man Action and the woman the sleep and rest\\nthat produce Action. The figure of Lorenzo typifies Contemplation,\\nthe woman Dawn, and the man Twilight, the states which lie between\\nlight and darkness, action and rest. What Michelangelo -- who owed\\nnothing to any Medici save only Lorenzo the Magnificent and had seen\\nthe best years of his life frittered away in the service of them and\\nother proud princes -- may also have intended we shall never know; but\\nhe was a saturnine man with a long memory, and he might easily have\\nmade the tombs a vehicle for criticism. One would not have another\\ntouch of the chisel on either of the symbolical male figures.\\n\\nAlthough a tomb to Lorenzo the Magnificent by Michelangelo would\\nsurely have been a wonderful thing, there is something startling and\\narresting in the circumstance that he has none at all from any hand,\\nbut lies here unrecorded. His grandfather, in the church itself,\\nrests beneath a plain slab, which aimed so consciously at modesty\\nas thereby to achieve special distinction: Lorenzo, leaving no such\\ndirections, has nothing, while in the same room are monuments to\\ntwo common-place descendants to thrill the soul. The disparity is in\\nitself monumental. That Michelangelo's Madonna and Child are on the\\nslab which covers the dust of Lorenzo and his brother is a chance. The\\nsaints on either side are S. Cosimo and S. Damian, the patron saints\\nof old Cosimo de' Medici, and are by Michelangelo's assistants. The\\nMadonna was intended for the altar of the sacristy. Into this work the\\nsculptor put much of his melancholy and, one feels, disappointment. The\\nface of the Madonna is already sad and hopeless; but the Child is\\nperhaps the most splendid and determined of any in all Renaissance\\nsculpture. He may, if we like, symbolize the new generation that is\\nalways deriving sustenance from the old, without care or thought of\\nwhat the old has to suffer; he crushes his head against his mother's\\nbreast in a very passion of vigorous dependence. \\n\\nWhatever was originally intended, it is certain that in Michelangelo's\\nsacristy disillusionment reigns as well as death. But how beautiful\\nit is!\\n\\nIn a little room leading from the sacristy I was shown by a smiling\\ncustodian Lorenzo the Magnificent's coffin, crumbling away, and\\nphotographs of the skulls of the two brothers: Giuliano's with one\\nof Francesco de' Pazzi's dagger wounds in it, and Lorenzo's, ghastly\\nin its decay. I gave the man half a lira.\\n\\nWhile he was working on the tombs Michelangelo had undertaken now and\\nthen a small commission, and to this period belongs the David which we\\nshall see in the little room on the ground floor of the Bargello. In\\n1534, when he finally abandoned the sacristy, and, leaving Florence for\\never, settled in Rome, the Laurentian library was only begun, and he\\nhad little interest in it. He never saw it again. At Rome his time was\\nfully occupied in painting the \\\"Last Judgment\\\" in the Sixtine Chapel,\\nand in various architectural works. But Florence at any rate has two\\nmarble masterpieces that belong to the later period -- the Brutus in\\nthe Bargello and the Piet\\u00e0 in the Duomo, which we have seen -- that\\npoignantly impressive rendering of the entombment upon which the old\\nman was at work when he died, and which he meant for his own grave.\\n\\nHis death came in 1564, on February 23rd, when he was nearly\\neighty-nine, and his body was brought to Florence and buried amid\\nuniversal grief in S. Croce, where it has a florid monument.\\n\\nSince we are considering the life of Michelangelo, I might perhaps\\nsay here a few words about his house, which is only a few minutes'\\ndistant -- at No. 64 Via Ghibellina -- where certain early works and\\npersonal relics are preserved. Michelangelo gave the house to his\\nnephew Leonardo; it was decorated early in the seventeenth century with\\nscenes in the life of the master, and finally bequeathed to the city\\nas a heritage in 1858. It is perhaps the best example of the rapacity\\nof the Florentines; for notwithstanding that it was left freely in\\nthis way a lira is charged for admission. The house contains more\\ncollateral curiosities, as they might be called, than those in the\\ndirect line; but there are architectural drawings from the wonderful\\nhand, colour drawings of a Madonna, a few studies, and two early pieces\\nof sculpture -- the battle of the Lapithae and Centaurs, a relief marked\\nby tremendous vigour and full of movement, and a Madonna and Child,\\nalso in relief, with many marks of greatness upon it. In a recess\\nin Room IV are some personal relics of the artist, which his great\\nnephew, the poet, who was named after him, began to collect early in\\nthe seventeenth century. As a whole the house is disappointing.\\n\\nUpstairs have been arranged a quantity of prints and drawings\\nillustrating the history of Florence.\\n\\nThe S. Lorenzo cloisters may be entered either from a side door in\\nthe church close to the Old Sacristy or from the piazza. Although an\\nofficial in uniform keeps the piazza door, they are free. Brunelleschi\\nis again the architect, and from the loggia at the entrance to the\\nlibrary you see most acceptably the whole of his cathedral dome and\\nhalf of Giotto's tower. It is impossible for Florentine cloisters -- or\\nindeed any cloisters -- not to have a certain beauty, and these are\\nunusually charming and light, seen both from the loggia and the ground.\\n\\nMichelangelo's Biblioteca Laurenziana, which leads from them,\\nis one of the most perfect of sombre buildings, the very home of\\nwell-ordered scholarship. The staircase is impressive, although perhaps\\na little too severe; the long room could not be more satisfying to\\nthe eye. Michelangelo died before it was finished, but it is his in\\ndesign, even to the ceiling and cases for MSS. in which the library\\nis so rich, and the rich red wood ceiling. Vasari, Michelangelo's\\npupil and friend and the biographer to whom we are so much indebted,\\ncarried on the work. His scheme of windows has been upset on the\\nside opposite the cloisters by the recent addition of a rotunda\\nleading from the main room. If ever rectangular windows were more\\nexquisitely and nobly proportioned I should like to see them. The\\nlibrary is free for students, and the attendants are very good in\\ncalling stray visitors' attention to illuminated missals, old MSS.,\\nearly books and so forth. One of Galileo's fingers, stolen from his\\nbody, used to be kept here, in a glass case, and may be here still;\\nbut I did not see it. I saw, however, the portraits, in an old volume,\\nof Petrarch and his Laura.\\n\\nThis wonderful collection was begun by Cosimo de' Medici; others\\nadded to it until it became one of the most valuable in the world,\\nnot, however, without various vicissitudes incident to any Florentine\\ninstitution: while one of its most cherished treasures, the Virgil\\nof the fourth or fifth century, was even carried to Paris by Napoleon\\nand not returned until the great year of restoration, 1816. Among the\\nholograph MSS. is Cellini's \\\"Autobiography\\\". The library, in time,\\nafter being confiscated by the Republic and sold to the monks of\\nS. Marco, again passed into the possession of a Medici, Leo X, son\\nof Lorenzo the Magnificent, and then of Clement VII, and he it was\\nwho commissioned Michelangelo to house it with dignity.\\n\\nAn old daily custom in the cloisters of S. Lorenzo was the feeding of\\ncats; but it has long since been dropped. If you look at Mr. Hewlett's\\n\\\"Earthwork out of Tuscany\\\" you will find an entertaining description\\nof what it used to be like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nOr San Michele and the Palazzo Vecchio\\n\\nThe little Bigallo -- The Misericordia -- Or San Michele -- Andrea\\nOrcagna -- The Tabernacle -- Old Glass -- A company of stone\\nsaints -- Donatello's S. George -- Dante conferences -- The Guilds of\\nFlorence -- The Palazzo Vecchio -- Two Towers -- Bandinelli's group -- The\\nMarzocco -- The Piazza della Signoria -- Orcagna's Loggia -- Cellini\\nand Cosimo -- The Perseus -- Verrocchio's dolphin -- The Great Council\\nHall -- Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's cartoons -- Bandinelli's\\nmalice -- The Palazzo Vecchio as a home -- Two cells and the bell of\\nindependence.\\n\\nLet us now proceed along the Via Calzaioli (which means street of\\nthe stocking-makers), running away from the Piazza del Duomo to\\nthe Piazza della Signoria. The fascinatingly pretty building at\\nthe corner, opposite Pisano's Baptistery doors, is the Bigallo,\\nin the loggia of which foundling children used to be displayed in\\nthe hope that passers-by might pity them sufficiently to make them\\npresents or even adopt them; but this custom continues no longer. The\\nBigallo was designed, it is thought, by Orcagna, and it is worth the\\nminutest study.\\n\\nThe Company of the Bigallo, which is no longer an active force, was\\none of the benevolent societies of old Florence. But the greatest\\nof these societies, still busy and merciful, is the Misericordia,\\nwhose head-quarters are just across the Via Calzaioli, in the piazza,\\nfacing the campanile, a company of Florentines pledged at a moment's\\nnotice, no matter on what they may be engaged, to assist in any\\ncharitable work of necessity. For the most part they carry ambulances\\nto the scenes of accident and perform the last offices for the dead\\nin the poorer districts. When on duty they wear black robes and\\nhoods. Their headquarters comprise a chapel, with an altar by Andrea\\ndella Robbia, and a statue of the patron saint of the Misericordia,\\nS. Sebastian. But their real patron saint is their founder, a common\\nporter named Pietro Borsi. In the thirteenth century it was the custom\\nfor the porters and loafers connected with the old market to meet\\nin a shelter here and pass the time away as best they could. Borsi,\\njoining them, was distressed to find how unprofitable were the hours,\\nand he suggested the formation of a society to be of some real use,\\nthe money to support it to be obtained by fines in payment for oaths\\nand blasphemies. A litter or two were soon bought and the machinery\\nstarted. The name was the Company of the Brothers of Mercy. That was\\nin 1240 to 1250. To-day no Florentine is too grand to take his part,\\nand at the head of the porter's band of brethren is the King.\\n\\nPassing along the Via Calzaioli we come on the right to a noble square\\nbuilding with statues in its niches -- Or San Michele, which stands on\\nthe site of the chapel of San Michele in Orto. San Michele in Orto,\\nor more probably in Horreo (meaning either in the garden or in the\\ngranary), was once part of a loggia used as a corn market, in which\\nwas preserved a picture by Ugolino da Siena representing the Virgin,\\nand this picture had the power of working miracles. Early in the\\nfourteenth century the loggia was burned down but the picture was\\nsaved (or quickly replaced), and a new building on a much larger and\\nmore splendid scale was made for it, none other than Or San Michele,\\nthe chief architect being Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's pupil and later\\nthe constructor of the Ponte Vecchio. Where the picture then was, I\\ncannot say -- whether inside the building or out -- but the principal use\\nof the building was to serve as a granary. After 1348, when Florence\\nwas visited by that ravaging plague which Boccaccio describes in\\nsuch gruesome detail at the beginning of the \\\"Decameron\\\" and which\\nsent his gay company of ladies and gentlemen to the Villa Palmieri\\nto take refuge in story telling, and when this sacred picture was\\nmore than commonly busy and efficacious, it was decided to apply\\nthe enormous sums of money given to the shrine from gratitude in\\nbeautifying the church still more, and chiefly in providing a casket\\nworthy of holding such a pictorial treasure. Hence came about the\\nnoble edifice of to-day.\\n\\nA man of universal genius was called in to execute the tabernacle:\\nAndrea Orcagna, a pupil probably of Andrea Pisano, and also much\\ninfluenced by Giotto, whom though he had not known he idolized,\\nand one who, like Michelangelo later, was not only a painter and\\nsculptor but an architect and a poet. Orcagna, or, to give him his\\nright name, Andrea di Cione, for Orcagna was an abbreviation of\\nArcagnolo, flourished in the middle of the fourteenth century. Among\\nhis best-known works in painting are the Dantesque frescoes in the\\nStrozzi chapel at S. Maria Novella, and that terrible allegory of\\nDeath and Judgment in the Campo Santo at Pisa, in which the gay riding\\nparty come upon the three open graves. Orcagna put all his strength\\ninto the tabernacle of Or San Michele, which is a most sumptuous,\\nbeautiful and thoughtful shrine, yet owing to the darkness of the\\nchurch is almost invisible. Guides, it is true, will emerge from the\\ngloom and hold lighted tapers to it, but a right conception of it is\\nimpossible. The famous miraculous picture over the altar is notable\\nrather for its properties than for its intrinsic beauty; it is the\\npanels of the altar, which contain Orcagna's most exquisite work,\\nrepresenting scenes in the life of the Virgin, with emblematical\\nfigures interspersed, that one wishes to see. Only the back, however,\\ncan be seen really well, and this only when a door opposite to it -- in\\nthe Via Calzaioli -- is opened. It should always be open, with a grille\\nacross it, that passers-by might have constant sight of this almost\\nunknown Florentine treasure. It is in the relief of the death of the\\nVirgin on the back that -- on the extreme right -- Orcagna introduced\\nhis own portrait. The marble employed is of a delicate softness, and\\nOrcagna had enough of Giotto's tradition to make the Virgin a reality\\nand to interest Her, for example, as a mother in the washing of Her\\nBaby, as few painters have done, and in particular, as, according\\nto Ruskin, poor Ghirlandaio could not do in his fresco of the birth\\nof the Virgin Herself. It was Orcagna's habit to sign his sculpture\\n\\\"Andrea di Cione, painter,\\\" and his paintings \\\"Andrea di Cione,\\nsculptor,\\\" and thus point his versatility. By this tabernacle, by\\nhis Pisan fresco, and by the designs of the Loggia de' Lanzi and the\\nBigallo (which are usually given to him), he takes his place among\\nthe most interesting and various of the forerunners of the Renaissance.\\n\\nWithin Or San Michele you learn the secret of the stoned-up windows\\nwhich one sees with regret from without. Each, or nearly each, has\\nan altar against it. What the old glass was like one can divine from\\nthe lovely and sombre top lights in exquisite patterns that are left;\\nthat on the centre of the right wall of the church, as one enters,\\nhaving jewels of green glass as lovely as any I ever saw. But blues,\\npurples, and reds predominate.\\n\\nThe tabernacle apart, the main appeal of Or San Michele is the statuary\\nand stone-work of the exterior; for here we find the early masters\\nat their best. The building being the head-quarters of the twelve\\nFlorentine guilds, the statues and decorations were commissioned by\\nthem. It is as though our City companies should unite in beautifying\\nthe Guildhall. Donatello is the greatest artist here, and it was\\nfor the Armourers that he made his S. George, which stands now, as\\nhe carved it in marble, in the Bargello, but has a bronze substitute\\nin its original niche, below which is a relief of the slaying of the\\ndragon from Donatello's chisel. Of this glorious S. George more will\\nbe said later. But I may remark now that in its place here it instantly\\nproves the modernity and realistic vigour of its sculptor. Fine though\\nthey be, all the other statues of this building are conventional;\\nthey carry on a tradition of religious sculpture such as Niccol\\u00f2\\nPisano respected, many years earlier, when he worked at the Pisan\\npulpit. But Donatello's S. George is new and is as beautiful as a\\nGreek god, with something of real human life added.\\n\\nDonatello (with Michelozzo) also made the exquisite border of the\\nniche in the Via Calzaioli fa\\u00e7ade, in which Christ and S. Thomas now\\nstand. He was also to have made the figures (for the Merchants' Guild)\\nbut was busy elsewhere, and they fell to Verrocchio, of whom also we\\nshall have much to see and say at the Bargello, and to my mind they\\nare the most beautiful of all. The John the Baptist (made for the\\nCloth-dealers), also on this fa\\u00e7ade, is by Ghiberti of the Baptistery\\ngates. On the fa\\u00e7ade of the Via de' Lamberti is Donatello's superb\\nS. Mark (for the Joiners), which led to Michelangelo's criticism that\\nhe had never seen a man who looked more virtuous, and if S. Mark\\nwere really like that he would believe all his words. \\\"Why don't\\nyou speak to me?\\\" he also said to this statue, as Donatello had\\nsaid to the Zuccone. Higher on this fa\\u00e7ade is Luca della Robbia's\\nfamous arms of the Silk-weavers, one of the perfect things. Luca\\nalso made the arms of the Guild of Merchants, with its Florentine\\nfleur-de-lis in the midst. For the rest, Ghiberti's S. Stephen,\\nand Ghiberti and Michelozzo's S. Matthew, on the entrance wall,\\nare the most remarkable. The blacksmith relief is very lively and\\nthe blacksmith's saint a noble figure.\\n\\nThe little square reliefs let into the wall at intervals\\nare often charming, and the stone-work of the windows is very\\nlovely. In fact, the four walls of this fortress church are almost\\ninexhaustible. Within, its vaulted roof is so noble, its proportions\\nso satisfying. One should often sit quietly here, in the gloom,\\nand do nothing.\\n\\nThe little building just across the way was the Guild House of the\\nArte della Lana, or Wool-combers, and is now the head-quarters of\\nthe Italian Dante Society, who hold a conference every Thursday\\nin the large room over Or San Michele, gained by the flying\\nbuttress-bridge. The dark picture on the outer wall is the very\\nMadonna to which, when its position was at the Mercato Vecchio,\\ncondemned criminals used to pray on their way to execution.\\n\\nBefore we leave Or San Michele and the Arte della Lana, a word on\\nthe guilds of Florence is necessary, for at a period in Florentine\\nhistory between, say, the middle of the thirteenth century and the\\nbeginning of the fifteenth, they were the very powerful controllers\\nof the domestic affairs of the city; and it is possible that it would\\nhave been better for the Florentines had they continued to be so. For\\nFlorence was essentially mercantile and the guilds were composed of\\nbusiness men; and it is natural that business men should know better\\nthan noblemen what a business city needed. They were divided into\\nmajor guilds, chief of which were the woollen merchants -- the Arte\\ndella Lana -- and the silk merchants -- the Calimala -- and it was their\\npride to put their riches at the city's service. Thus, the Arte della\\nLana had charge of the building of the cathedral. Each of the major\\nguilds provided a Prior, and the Priors elected the Signoria, who\\ngoverned the city. It is one of the principal charges that is brought\\nagainst Cosimo de' Medici that he broke the power of the guilds.\\n\\nReturning to the Via Calzaioli, and turning to the right, we come\\nvery quickly to the Piazza della Signoria, and see before us,\\ndiagonally across it, the Loggia de' Lanzi and the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nwith the gleaming, gigantic figure of Michelangelo's David against\\nthe dark gateway. This, more than the Piazza del Duomo, is the centre\\nof Florence.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Vecchio was for centuries called the Signoria, being the\\nhome of the Gonfalonier of Florence and the Signoria who assisted\\nhis councils. It was begun by Arnolfo, the architect of the Duomo and\\nS. Croce, at the end of the thirteenth century, that being, as we have\\nseen, a period of great prosperity and ambition in Florence, but many\\nalterations and additions were made -- by Michelozzo, Cronaca, Vasari,\\nand others -- to bring it to what it now is. After being the scene\\nof many riots, executions, and much political strife and dubiety,\\nit became a ducal palace in 1532, and is now a civic building and\\nshow-place. In the old days the Palazzo had a ringhiera, or platform,\\nin front of it, from which proclamations were made. To know what\\nthis was like one has but to go to S. Trinit\\u00e0 on a very fine morning\\nand look at Ghirlandaio's fresco of the granting of the charter to\\nS. Francis. The scene, painted in 1485, includes not only the Signoria\\nbut the Loggia de' Lanzi (then the Loggia dell' Orcagna) -- both before\\nany statues were set up.\\n\\nEvery fa\\u00e7ade of the Palazzo Vecchio is splendid. I cannot say which\\nI admire more -- that which one sees from the Loggia de' Lanzi, with\\nits beautiful coping of corbels, at once so heavy and so light, with\\ncoloured escutcheons between them, or that in the Via de' Gondi, with\\nits fine jumble of old brickwork among the stones. The Palazzo Vecchio\\nis one of the most resolute and independent buildings in the world;\\nand it had need to be strong, for the waves of Florentine revolt were\\nalways breaking against it. The tower rising from this square fortress\\nhas at once grace and strength and presents a complete contrast to\\nGiotto's campanile; for Giotto's campanile is so light and delicate and\\nreasonable and this tower of the Signoria so stern and noble. There\\nis a difference as between a beautiful woman and a powerful man. In\\nthe functions of the two towers -- the dominating towers of Florence -- is\\na wide difference also, for the campanile calls to prayer, while for\\nyears the sombre notes of the great Signoria bell -- the Vacca -- rang out\\nonly to bid the citizens to conclave or battle or to sound an alarm.\\n\\nIt was this Vacca wich (with others) the brave Piero Capponi\\nthreatened to ring when Charles VIII wished, in 1494, to force a\\ndisgraceful treaty on the city. The scene was the Medici Palace in\\nthe Via Larga. The paper was ready for signature and Capponi would\\nnot sign. \\\"Then I must bid my trumpets blow,\\\" said Charles. \\\"If you\\nsound your trumpets,\\\" Capponi replied, \\\"we will ring our bells;\\\"\\nand the King gave way, for he knew that his men had no chance in this\\ncity if it rose suddenly against them.\\n\\nBut the glory of the Palazzo Vecchio tower -- afer its proportions -- is\\nthat brilliant inspiration of the architect which led him, so to\\nspeak, to begin again by setting the four columns on the top of the\\nsolid portion. These pillars are indescribably right: so solid\\nand yet so light, so powerful and yet so comely. Their duty was\\nto support the bells, and particularly the Vacca, when he rocked\\nhis gigantic weight of green bronze to and fro to warn the city.\\nSeen from a distance the columns are always beautiful; seen close\\nby they are each a tower of comfortable strength. And how the wind\\nblows through them from the Apennines!\\n\\nThe David on the left of the Palazzo Vecchio main door is only a copy.\\nThe original stood there until 1873, when, after three hundred and\\nsixty-nine years, it was moved to a covered spot in the Accademia,\\nas we shall there see and learn its history. If we want to know what\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio looked like at the time David was placed there,\\na picture by Piero di Cosimo in our National Gallery tells us, for\\nhe makes it the background of his portrait of Ferrucci, No. 895.\\n\\nThe group on the right represents Hercules and Cacus, and\\nis by Baccio Bandinelli (1485-1560), a coarse and offensive man,\\njealous of most people and particularly of Michelangelo, to whom,\\nbut for his displeasing Pope Clement VII, the block of marble from\\nwhich the Hercules was carved would have been given. Bandinelli in\\nhis delight at obtaining it vowed to surpass that master's David,\\nand those who want to know what Florence thought of his effort should\\nconsult the amusing and malicious pages of Cellini's Autobiography.\\nOn its way to Bandinelli's studio the block fell into the Arrio, and\\nit was a joke of the time that it had drowned itself to avoid its fate\\nat the sculptor's hands. Even after he had half done it, there was a\\nmoment when Michelangelo had an opportunity of taking over the stone\\nand turning it into a Samson, but the siege of Florence intervened,\\nand eventually Bandinelli had his way and the hideous thing now on\\nview was evolved.\\n\\nThe lion at the left end of the fa\\u00e7ade is also a copy, the original\\nby Donatello being in the Bargello, close by; but the pedestal is\\nDonatello's original. This lion is the Marzocco, the legendary guardian\\nof the Florentine republic, and it stood here for four centuries and\\nmore, superseding one which was kissed as a sign of submission by\\nthousands of Pisan prisoners in 1364. The Florentine fleur-de-lis on\\nthe pediment is very beautiful. The same lion may be seen in iron on\\nhis staff at the top of the Palazzo Vecchio tower, and again on the\\nBargello, bravely flourishing his lily against the sky.\\n\\nThe great fountain with its bronze figures at this corner is by\\nBartolommeo Ammanati, a pupil of Bandinelli, and the statue of Cosimo\\nI is by Gian Bologna, who was the best of the post-Michelangelo\\nsculptors and did much good work in Florence, as we shall see at the\\nBargello and in the Boboli Gardens. He studied under Michelangelo\\nin Rome. Though born a Fleming and called a Florentine, his great\\nfountain at Bologna, which is really a fine thing, has identified his\\nfame with that city. Had not Ammanati's design better pleased Cosimo\\nI, the Bologna fountain would be here, for it was designed for this\\npiazza. Gian's best-known work is the Flying Mercury in the Bargello,\\nwhich we have seen, on mantelpieces and in shop windows, everywhere;\\nbut what is considered his masterpiece is over there, in the Loggia de'\\nLanzi, the very beautiful building on the right of the Palazzo, the\\n\\\"Rape of the Sabines,\\\" a group which, to me, gives no pleasure. The\\nbronze reliefs under the Cosimo statue -- this Cosimo being, of course,\\nfar other than Cosimo de' Medici, Father of his Country: Cosimo\\nI of Tuscany, who insisted upon a crown and reigned from 1537 to\\n1575 -- represents his assumption of rule on the death of Alessandro in\\n1537; his triumphant entry into Siena when he conquered it and absorbed\\nit; and his reception of the rank of Grand Duke. Of Cosimo (whom we\\nmet in Chapter V) more will be said when we enter the Palazzo Vecchio.\\n\\nBetween this statue and the Loggia de' Lanzi is a bronze tablet let\\ninto the paving which tells us that it was on this very spot, in 1498,\\nthat Savonarola and two of his companions were put to death. The\\nancient palace on the Duomo side of the piazza is attributed in\\ndesign to Raphael, who, like most of the great artists of his time,\\nwas also an architect and was the designer of the Palazzo Pandolfini\\nin the Via San Gallo, No. 74. The Palazzo we are now admiring for\\nits blend of massiveness and beauty is the Uguccione, and anybody\\nwho wishes may probably have a whole floor of it to-day for a few\\nshillings a week. The building which completes the piazza on the\\nright of us, with coats of arms on its fa\\u00e7ade, is now given to the\\nBoard of Agriculture and has been recently restored. It was once\\na Court of Justice. The great building at the opposite side of the\\npiazza, where the trams start, is a good example of modern Florentine\\narchitecture based on the old: the Palazzo Landi, built in 1871 and\\nnow chiefly an insurance office. In London we have a more attractive\\nthough smaller derivative of the great days of Florentine building,\\nin Standen's wool shop in Jermyn Street.\\n\\nThe Piazza della Signoria has such riches that one is in danger of\\nneglecting some. The Palazzo Vecchio, for example, so overpowers\\nthe Loggia de' Lanzi in size as to draw the eye from that perfect\\nstructure. One should not allow this to happen; one should let\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio's solid nobility wait awhile and concentrate\\non the beauty of Orcagna's three arches. Coming so freshly from his\\ntabernacle in Or San Michele we are again reminded of the versatility\\nof the early artists.\\n\\nThis structure, originally called the Loggia de' Priori or Loggia\\nd'Orcagna, was built in the fourteenth century as an open place for\\nthe delivery of proclamations and for other ceremonies, and also as\\na shelter from the rain, the last being a purpose it still serves. It\\nwas here that Savonarola's ordeal by fire would have had place had it\\nnot been frustrated. Vasari also gives Orcagna the four symbolical\\nfigures in the recesses in the spandrels of the arches. The Loggia,\\nwhich took its new name from the Swiss lancers, or lanzi, that Cosimo\\nI kept there -- he being a fearful ruler and never comfortable without a\\nbodyguard -- is now a recognized place of siesta; and hither many people\\ncarry their poste-restante correspondence from the neighbouring post\\noffice in the Uffizi to read in comfort. A barometer and thermometer\\nare almost the only novelties that a visitor from the sixteenth\\ncentury would notice.\\n\\nThe statuary is both old and new; for here are genuine antiques once\\nin Ferdinand I's Villa Medici at Rome, and such modern masterpieces\\nas Donatello's Judith and Holofernes, Cellini's Perseus, and Gian\\nBologna's two muscular and restless groups. The best of the antiques\\nis the Woman Mourning, the fourth from the end on the left, which is\\na superb creation.\\n\\nDonatello's Judith, which gives me less pleasure than any of his work,\\nboth in the statue and in the relief, was commissioned for Cosimo\\nde' Medici, who placed it in the courtyard or garden of the Medici\\npalace -- Judith, like David, by her brave action against a tyrant,\\nbeing a champion of the Florentine republic. In 1495, after Cosimo's\\nworthless grandson Piero de' Medici had been expelled from Florence\\nand the Medici palace sacked, the statue was moved to the front of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, where the David now is, and an inscription placed\\non it describing it as a warning to all enemies of liberty. This\\nposition being needed for Michelangelo's David, in 1506, Judith was\\nmoved to the Loggia to the place where the Sabine group now is. In\\n1560 it took up its present position.\\n\\nCellini's Perseus will not quite do, I think, after Donatello and\\nVerrocchio; but few bronzes are more famous, and certainly of none\\nhas so vivacious and exciting a story been written as Cellini's own,\\nsetting forth his disappointments, mortifications, and pride in\\nconnexion with this statue. Cellini, whatever one may think of his\\nveracity, is a diverting and valuable writer, and the picture of\\nCosimo I which he draws for us is probably very near the truth. We\\nsee him haughty, familiar, capricious, vain, impulsive, clear-sighted,\\nand easily flattered; intensely pleased to be in a position to command\\nthe services of artists and very unwilling to pay. Cellini was a blend\\nof lackey, child, and genius. He left Francis I in order to serve\\nCosimo and never ceased to regret the change. The Perseus was his\\ngreatest accomplishment for Cosimo, and the narrative of its casting\\nis terrific and not a little like Dumas. When it was uncovered in its\\npresent position all Florence flocked to the Loggia to praise it; the\\npoets placed commendatory sonnets on the pillars, and the sculptor\\npeacocked up and down in an ecstasy of triumph. Then, however, his\\ntroubles once more began, for Cosimo had the craft to force Cellini\\nto name the price, and we see Cellini in an agony between desire for\\nenough and fear lest if he named enough he would offend his patron.\\n\\nThe whole book is a comedy of vanity and jealousy and Florentine\\nvigour, with Courts as a background. It is good to read it; it is\\ngood, having read it, to study once again the unfevered resolute\\nfeatures of Donatello's S. George. Cellini himself we may see among\\nthe statues under the Uffizi and again in the place of honour (as a\\ngoldsmith) in the centre of the Ponte Vecchio. Looking at the Perseus\\nand remembering Donatello, one realizes that what Cellini wanted was\\ncharacter. He had temperament enough but no character. Perseus is\\nsuperb, commanding, distinguished, and one doesn't care a fig for it.\\n\\nOn entering the Palazzo Vecchio we come instantly to one of the most\\ncharming things in Florence -- Verrocchio's fountain -- which stands\\nin the midst of the courtyard. This adorable work -- a little bronze\\nCupid struggling with a spouting dolphin -- was made for Lorenzo de'\\nMedici's country villa at Careggi and was brought here when the\\npalazzo was refurnished for Francis I, Cosimo I's son and successor,\\nand his bride, Joanna of Austria, in 1565. Nothing could better\\nillustrate the accomplishment and imaginative adaptability of the great\\ncraftsmen of the day than the two works of Verrocchio that we have\\nnow seen: the Christ and S. Thomas at Or San Michele, in Donatello\\nand Michelozzo's niche, and this exquisite fountain splashing water\\nso musically. Notice the rich decorations of the pillars of this\\ncourtyard and the rich colour and power of the pillars themselves. The\\nhalf-obliterated frescoes of Austrian towns on the walls were made to\\nprevent Joanna from being homesick, but were more likely, one would\\nguess, to stimulate that malady. In the left corner is the entrance\\nto the old armoury, now empty, with openings in the walls through\\nwhich pieces might be discharged at various angles on any advancing\\nhost. The groined ceiling could support a pyramid.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Vecchio's ground floor is a series of thoroughfares in\\nwhich people are passing continually amid huge pillars and along\\ndark passages; but our way is up the stone steps immediately to the\\nleft on leaving the courtyard where Verrocchio's child eternally\\nsmiles, for the steps take us to that vast hall designed by Cronaca\\nfor Savonarola's Great Council, which was called into being for the\\ngovernment of Florence after the luckless Piero de' Medici had been\\nbanished in 1494. Here much history was made. As to its structure\\nand its architect, Vasari, who later was called in to restore it,\\nhas a deal to say, but it is too technical for us. It was built\\nby Simone di Pollaiuolo, who was known as Cronaca (the Chronicler)\\nfrom his vivid way of telling his adventures. Cronaca (1454-1508),\\nwho was a personal friend and devotee of Savonarola, drew up his plan\\nin consultation with Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo (although then\\nso young: only nineteen or twenty) and others. Its peculiarity is that\\nit is one of the largest rooms in existence without pillars. From the\\nfoot of the steps to the further wall I make it fifty-eight paces,\\nand thirty wide; and the proportions strike the eye as perfect. The\\nwall behind the steps is not at right angles with the other -- and this\\nmust be as peculiar as the absence of pillars.\\n\\nOnce there were to be paintings here by the greatest of all, for\\nmasters no less than Leonardo and Michelangelo were commissioned to\\ndecorate it, each with a great historical painting: a high honour\\nfor the youthful Michelangelo. The loss of these works is one of\\nthe tragedies of art. Leonardo chose for his subject the battle of\\nAnghiari, an incident of 1440 when the Florentines defeated Piccinino\\nand saved their Republic from the Milanese and Visconti. But both\\nthe cartoon and the fresco have gone for ever, and our sense of loss\\nis not diminished by reading in Leonardo's Thoughts on Painting the\\ndirections which he wrote for the use of artists who proposed to paint\\nbattles: one of the most interesting and exciting pieces of writing in\\nthe literature of art. Michelangelo's work, which never reached the\\nwall of the room, as Leonardo's had done, was completed as a cartoon\\nin 1504 to 1506 in his studio in the hospital of the dyers in Sant'\\nOnofrio, which is now the Via Guelfa. The subject was also military:\\nan incident in the long and bitter struggle between Florence and Pisa,\\nwhen Sir John Hawkwood (then in the pay of the Pisans, before he came\\nover finally to the Florentines) attacked a body of Florentines who\\nwere bathing in the river. The scene gave the young artist scope both\\nfor his power of delineating a spirited incident and for his drawing\\nof the nude, and those who saw it said of this work that it was finer\\nthan anything the painter ever did. While it was in progress all\\nthe young artists came to Sant' Onofrio to study it, as they and its\\ncreator had before flocked to the Carmine, where Masaccio's frescoes\\nhad for three-quarters of a century been object-lessons to students.\\n\\nWhat became of the cartoon is not definitely known, but Vasari's\\nstory is that Bandinelli, the sculptor of the Hercules and Cacus\\noutside the Palazzo, who was one of the most diligent copyists of the\\ncartoon after it was placed in a room in this building, had the key\\nof the door counterfeited, and, obtaining entrance during a moment\\nof tumult, destroyed the picture. The reasons given are: (1, and a\\nvery poor one) that he desired to own the pieces; (2) that he wished\\nto deprive other and rival students of the advantage of copying it;\\n(3) that he wanted Leonardo to be the only painter of the Palazzo to\\nbe considered; and (4, and sufficient) that he hated Michelangelo. At\\nthis time Bandinelli could not have been more than eighteen. Vasari's\\nstory is uncorroborated.\\n\\nLeonardo's battle merely perished, being done in some fugitive medium;\\nand the walls are now covered with the works of Vasari himself\\nand his pupils and do not matter, while the ceiling is a muddle\\nof undistinguished paint. There are many statues which also do not\\nmatter; but at the raised end is Leo X, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent,\\nand the first Medici Pope, and at the other a colossal modern statue\\nof Savonarola, who was in person the dominating influence here for\\nthe years between 1494 and 1497; who is to many the central figure\\nin the history of this building; and whose last night on earth was\\nspent with his companions in this very room. But to him we come in\\nthe chapter on S. Marco.\\n\\nMany rooms in the Palazzo are to be seen only on special occasions,\\nbut the great hall is always accessible. Certain rooms upstairs,\\nmostly with rich red and yellow floors, are also visible daily, all\\ninteresting; but most notable is the Salle de Lys, with its lovely blue\\nwalls of lilies, its glorious ceiling of gold and roses, Ghirlandaio's\\nfresco of S. Zenobius, and the perfect marble doorway containing\\nthe wooden doors of Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano, with the heads\\nof Dante and Petrarch in intarsia. Note the figures of Charity and\\nTemperance in the doorway and the charming youthful Baptist.\\n\\nIn Eleanor of Toledo's dining-room there are some rich and elaborate\\ngreen jugs which I remember very clearly and also the ceiling of her\\nworkroom with its choice of Penelope as the presiding genius. Both\\nEleanor's chapel and that in which Savonarola prayed before his\\nexecution are shown.\\n\\nBut the most popular room of all with visitors -- and quite naturally -- is\\nthe little boudoiresque study of Francis I, with its voluptuous\\nladies on the ceiling and the secret treasure-room leading from it,\\nwhile on the way, just outside the door, is a convenient oubliette\\ninto which to push any inconvenient visitor.\\n\\nThe loggia, which Mr. Morley has painted from the Via Castellani,\\nis also always accessible, and from it one has one of those pleasant\\nviews of warm roofs in which Florence abounds.\\n\\nOne of the most attractive of the smaller rooms usually on view is\\nthat one which leads from the lily-room and contains nothing but\\nmaps of the world: the most decorative things conceivable, next to\\nChinese paintings. Looking naturally for Sussex on the English map,\\nI found Winchelsey, Battel, Rye, Lewes, Sorham, Ar\\u00f4nde, and Cicestra.\\n\\nFrom the map-room a little room is gained where the debates in\\nthe Great Council Hall might be secretly overheard by interested\\neavesdroppers, but in particular by Cosimo I. A part of the cornice\\nhas holes in it for this purppse, but on regaining the hall itself\\nI found that the disparity in the pattern was perfectly evident even\\nto my eye, so that every one in those suspicious days must have been\\naware of the listener.\\n\\nThe tower should certainly be ascended -- not only for the view\\nand to be so near the bells and the pillars, but also for historic\\nassociations. After a little way we come to the cell where Cosimo de'\\nMedici, later to be the Father of his Country, was imprisoned, before\\nthat exile which ended in recall and triumph in 1433. This cell,\\nalthough not exactly \\\"a home from home,\\\" is possible. What is to be\\nsaid of that other, some thousands of steps (as it seems) higher,\\nwhere Savonarola was kept for forty days, varied only by intervals\\nof torture? For Savonarola's cell, which is very near the top, is\\nnothing but a recess in the wall with a door to it. It cannot be\\nmore than five feet wide and eight feet long, with an open loophole\\nto the wind. If a man were here for forty days and then pardoned his\\nlife would be worth very little. A bitter eyrie from which to watch\\nthe city one had risked all to reform. What thoughts must have been\\nhis in that trap! What reviews of policy! What illuminations as to\\nFlorentine character!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nThe Uffizi I: The Building and the Collectors\\n\\nThe growth of a gallery -- Vasari's Passaggio -- Cosimo I -- Francis\\nI -- Ferdinand I -- Ferdinand II -- Cosimo III -- Anna Maria Ludovica de'\\nMedici -- Pietro-Leopoldo -- The statues of the fa\\u00e7ade -- Art, literature,\\narms, science, and learning -- The omissions -- Florentine rapacity -- An\\nantique custom -- Window views -- The Uffizi drawings -- The best picture.\\n\\nThe foreigner should understand at once that any inquiries into the\\nhistory of the Uffizi family -- such as for example yield interesting\\nresults in the case of the Pazzi and the Albizzi -- are doomed to\\nfailure; because Uffizi merely means offices. The Palazzo degli\\nUffizi, or palace of offices, was built by Vasari, the biographer of\\nthe artists, for Cosimo I, who having taken the Signoria, or Palazzo\\nVecchio, for his own home, wished to provide another building for the\\nmunicipal government. It was begun in 1560 and still so far fulfils\\nits original purpose as to contain the general post office, while it\\nalso houses certain Tuscan archives and the national library.\\n\\nA glance at Piero di Cosimo's portrait of Ferrucci in our National\\nGallery will show that an ordinary Florentine street preceded the\\nerection of the Uffizi. At that time the top storey of the building,\\nas it now exists, was an open terrace affording a pleasant promenade\\nfrom the Palazzo Vecchio down to the river and back to the Loggia\\nde' Lanzi. Beneath this were studios and workrooms where Cosimo's\\narmy of artists and craftsmen (with Bronzino and Cellini as the most\\nfamous) were kept busy; while the public offices were on the ground\\nfloor. Then, as his family increased, Cosimo decided to move, and the\\nincomplete and abandoned Pitti Palace was bought and finished. In 1565,\\nas we have seen, Francis, Cosimo's son, married and was installed in\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio, and it was then that Vasari was called upon to\\nconstruct the Passaggio which unites the Palazzo Vecchio and the Pitti,\\ncrossing the river by the Ponte Vecchio -- Cosimo's idea (borrowed it\\nis said from Homer's description of the passage uniting the palaces of\\nPriam and Hector) being not only that he and his son might have access\\nto each other, but that in the event of danger on the other side of the\\nriver a body of soldiers could be swiftly and secretly mobilized there.\\n\\nCosimo I died in 1574, and Francis I (1574-1587) succeeded him not only\\nin rule but in that patronage of the arts which was one of the finest\\nMedicean traditions; and it was he who first thought of making the\\nUffizi a picture gallery. To do this was simple: it merely meant the\\nloss of part of the terrace by walling and roofing it in. Ferdinand\\nI (1587-1609) added the pretty Tribuna and other rooms, and brought\\nhither a number of the treasures from the Villa Medici at Rome. Cosimo\\nII (1609-1621) did little, but Ferdinand II (1621-1670) completed\\nthe roofing in of the terraces, placed there his own collection of\\ndrawings and a valuable collection of Venetian pictures which he\\nhad bought, together with those that his wife Vittoria della Rovere\\nhad brought him from Urbino, while his brothers, Cardinal Giovanni\\nCarlo de' Medici and Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici (the extremely\\nugly man with the curling chin, at the head of the Uffizi stairs),\\nadded theirs. Giovanni Carlo's pictures, which mostly went to the\\nPitti were varied; but Leopold's were chiefly portraits of artists,\\nwherever possible painted by themselves, a collection which is steadily\\nbeing added to at the present time and is to be seen in several rooms\\nof the Uffizi, and those miniature portraits of men of eminence which\\nwe shall see in the corridor between the Poccetti Gallery and Salon of\\nJustice at the Pitti. Cosimo III (1670-1723) added the Dutch pictures\\nand the famous Venus de' Medici and other Tribuna statuary.\\n\\nThe galleries remained the private property of the Medici family until\\nthe Electress Palatine, Anna Maria Ludovica de' Medici, daughter of\\nCosimo III and great niece of the Cardinal Leopold, bequeathed all\\nthese treasures, to which she had greatly added, together with bronzes\\nnow in the Bargello, Etruscan antiquities now in the Archaeological\\nMuseum, tapestries also there, and books in the Laurentian library,\\nto Florence for ever, on condition that they should never be removed\\nfrom Florence and should exist for the benefit of the public. Her\\ndeath was in 1743, and with her passed away the last descendant of\\nthat Giovanni de' Medici (1360-1429) whom we saw giving commissions\\nto Donatello, building the children's hospital, and helping Florence\\nto the best of his power: so that the first Medici and the last were\\nakin in love of art and in generosity to their beautiful city.\\n\\nThe new Austrian Grand Dukes continued to add to the Uffizi,\\nparticularly Pietro-Leopoldo (1765-1790), who also founded the\\nAccademia. To him was due the assembling, under the Uffizi roof,\\nof all the outlying pictures then belonging to the State, including\\nthose in the gallery of the hospital of S. Maria Nuova, which owned,\\namong others, the famous Hugo van der Goes. It was he also who\\nbrought together from Rome the Niobe statues and constructed a room\\nfor them. Leopold II added the Iscrizioni.\\n\\nIt was as recently as 1842 to 1856 that the statues of the great\\nFlorentines were placed in the portico. These, beginning at the Palazzo\\nVecchio, are, first, against the inner wall, Cosimo Pater (1389-1464)\\nand Lorenzo the Magnificent (1450-1492); then, outside: Orcagna;\\nAndrea Pisano, of the first Baptistery doors; Giotto and Donatello;\\nAlberti, who could do everything and who designed the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nS. Maria Novella; Leonardo and Michelangelo. Next, three poets, Dante\\n(1265-1321), Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374), and Giovanni Boccaccio\\n(1313-1375). Then Niccol\\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469-1527), the statesman,\\nand Francesco Guicciardini (1482-1540), the historian. That completes\\nthe first side.\\n\\nAt the end are Amerigo Vespucci (1451-1516), the explorer, who gave\\nhis name to America, and Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the astronomer;\\nand above is Cosimo I, the first Grand Duke.\\n\\nOn the Uffizi's river fa\\u00e7ade are four figures only -- and hundreds of\\nswallows' nests. The figures are Francesco Ferrucci, who died in 1530,\\nthe general painted by Piero di Cosimo in our National Gallery, who\\nrecaptured Volterra from Pope Clement VII in 1529; Giovanni delle Bande\\nNere (1500-1527), father of Cosimo I, and a great fighting man; Piero\\nCapponi, who died in 1496, and delivered Florence from Charles VIII in\\n1494, by threatening to ring the city bells; and Farinata degli Uberti,\\nan earlier soldier, who died in 1264 and is in the \\\"Divina Commedia\\\"\\nas a hero. It was he who repulsed the Ghibelline suggestion that\\nFlorence should be destroyed and the inhabitants emigrate to Empoli.\\n\\nWorking back towards the Loggia de' Lanzi we find less-known names:\\nPietro Antonio Michele (1679-1737), the botanist; Francesco Redi\\n(1626-1697), a poet and a man of science; Paolo Mascagni (1732-1815),\\nthe anatomist; Andrea Cesalpino (1519-1603), the philosopher;\\nS. Antonio (died 1461), Prior of the Convent of S. Marco and Archbishop\\nof Florence; Francesco Accorso (1182-1229), the jurist; Guido Aretino\\n(eleventh century), musician; and Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1572),\\nthe goldsmith and sculptor. The most notable omissions are Arnolfo\\nand Brunelleschi (but these are, as we have seen, on the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nthe Palazzo de' Canonici, opposite the south side of the cathedral),\\nGhiberti, Fra Angelico, and Savonarola. Personally I should like to\\nhave still others here, among them Giorgio Vasari, in recognition\\nof his enthusiastic and entertaining biographies of the Florentine\\nartists, to say nothing of the circumstance that he designed this\\nbuilding.\\n\\nBefore we enter any Florentine gallery let me say that there is only\\none free day and that the crowded Sabbath. Admittance to nearly all is\\na lira. Moreover, there is no re-admission. The charge strikes English\\nvisitors, accustomed to the open portals of their own museums and\\ngalleries, as an outrage, and it explains also the little interest in\\ntheir treasures which most Florentines display, for being essentially\\na frugal people they have seldom seen them. Visitors who can satisfy\\nthe authorities that they are desirous of studying the works of art\\nwith a serious purpose can obtain free passes; but only after certain\\npreliminaries, which include a seance with a photographer to satisfy\\nthe doorkeeper, by comparing the real and counterfeit physiognomies,\\nthat no illicit transference of the precious privilege has been\\nmade. Italy is, one knows, not a rich country; but the revenue which\\nthe gallery entrance-fees represent cannot reach any great volume,\\nand such as it is it had much better, I should say, be raised by\\nother means. Meanwhile, the foreigner chiefly pays it. What Giovanni\\nde' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici, and -- even more -- what Anna Maria\\nLudovica de' Medici, who bequeathed to the State these possessions,\\nwould think could they see this feverish and implacable pursuit of\\npence, I have not imagination, or scorn, enough to set down.\\n\\nInfirm and languid visitors should get it clearly into their heads (1)\\nthat the tour of the Uffizi means a long walk and (2) that there is\\na lift. You find it in the umbrella room -- at every Florentine gallery\\nand museum is an official whose one object in life is to take away your\\numbrella -- and it costs twopence-halfpenny and is worth far more. But\\nwalking downstairs is imperative, because otherwise one would miss\\nSilenus and Bacchus, and a beautiful urgent Mars, in bronze, together\\nwith other fine sculptured things.\\n\\nOne of the quaintest symbols of conservatism in Florence is the\\nscissors of the officials who supply tickets of entrance. Apparently\\nthe perforated line is unknown in Italy; hence the ticket is divided\\nfrom its counterfoil (which I assume goes to the authorities in\\norder that they may check their horrid takings) by a huge pair\\nof shears. These things are snip-snapping all over Italy, all day\\nlong. Having obtained your ticket you hand it to another official at a\\nturn-stile, and at last you are free of cupidity and red tape and may\\nbreathe easily again and examine the products of the light-hearted,\\ngenerous Renaissance in the right spirit.\\n\\nOne should never forget, in any gallery of Florence, to look out\\nof the windows. There is always a courtyard, a street, or a spire\\nagainst the sky; and at the Uffizi there are the river and bridges\\nand mountains. From the loggia of the Palazzo Vecchio I once saw a\\nwoman with some twenty or thirty city pigeons on the table of her\\nlittle room, feeding them with maize.\\n\\nExcept for glimpses of the river and the Via Guicciardini which it\\ngives, I advise no one to walk through the passage uniting the Pitti\\nand the Uffizi -- unless of course bent on catching some of the ancient\\nthrill when armed men ran swiftly from one palace to the other to quell\\na disturbance or repulse an assault. Particularly does this counsel\\napply to wet days, when all the windows are closed and there is no\\nair. A certain interest attaches to the myriad portraits which line\\nthe walls, chiefly of the Medici and comparatively recent worthies;\\nbut one must have a glutton's passion either for paint or history to\\nwish to examine these. As a matter of fact, only a lightning-speed\\ntourist could possibly think of seeing both the Uffizi and the Pitti\\non the same day, and therefore the need of the passage disappears. It\\nis hard worked only on Sundays.\\n\\nThe drawings in the cases in the first long corridor are worth close\\nstudy -- covering as they do the whole range of great Italian art: from,\\nsay, Uccello to Carlo Dolci. But as they are from time to time changed\\nit is useless to say more of them. There is also on the first landing\\nof the staircase a room in which exhibitions of drawings of the Old\\nMasters are held, and this is worth knowing about, not only because\\nof the riches of the portfolios in the collection, but also because\\nonce you have passed the doors you are inside the only picture gallery\\nin Florence for which no entrance fee is asked. How the authorities\\nhave come to overlook this additional source of revenue, I have no\\nnotion; but they have, and visitors should hasten to make the most\\nof it for fear that a translation of these words of mine may wander\\ninto bad hands.\\n\\nTo name the most wonderful picture in the Uffizi would be a very\\ndifficult task. At the Accademia, if a plebiscite were taken, there is\\nlittle doubt but that Botticelli's \\\"Primavera\\\" would win. At the Pitti\\nI personally would name Giorgione's \\\"Concert\\\" without any hesitation at\\nall; but probably the public vote would go to Raphael's \\\"Madonna della\\nSedia\\\". But the Uffizi? Here we are amid such wealth of masterpieces,\\nand yet when one comes to pass them in review in memory none stands\\nout as those other two I have named. Perhaps Botticelli would win\\nagain, with his \\\"Birth of Venus\\\". Were the Leonardo finished ... but\\nit is only a sketch. Luca Signorelli's wild flowers in No. 74 seem to\\nabide with me as vividly and graciously as anything; but they are but a\\ndetail and it is a very personal predilection. Perhaps the great exotic\\nwork painted far away in Belgium -- the Van der Goes triptych -- is the\\nmost memorable; but to choose an alien canvas is to break the rules of\\nthe game. Is it perhaps the unfinished Leonardo after all? If not, and\\nnot the Botticelli, it is beyond question that lovely adoring Madonna,\\nso gentle and sweet, against the purest and bluest of Tuscan skies,\\nwhich is attributed to Filippino Lippi: No. 1354.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nThe Uffizi II: The First Six Rooms\\n\\nLorenzo Monaco -- Fra Angelico -- Mariotto Albertinelli turns\\ninnkeeper -- The Venetian rooms -- Giorgione's death -- Titian -- Mantegna\\nuniting north and south -- Giovanni Bellini -- Domenico\\nGhirlandaio -- Michelangelo -- Luca Signorelli -- Wild flowers -- Leonardo\\nda Vinci -- Paolo Uccello.\\n\\nThe first and second rooms are Venetian; but I am inclined to think\\nthat it is better to take the second door on the left -- the first Tuscan\\nsalon -- and walking straight across it come at once to the Salon of\\nLorenzo Monaco and the primitives. For the earliest good pictures\\nare here. Here especially one should remember that the pictures\\nwere painted never for a gallery but for churches. Lorenzo Monaco\\n(Lawrence the Monk, 1370-c. 1425), who gives his name to this room,\\nwas a monk of the Camaldolese order in the Monastery of the Angeli,\\nand was a little earlier than Fra Angelico (the Angelic Brother),\\nthe more famous painting monk, whose dates are 1387-1455. Lorenzo\\nwas influenced by Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's godson, friend, pupil, and\\nassistant. His greatest work is this large Uffizi altar-piece -- he\\npainted nothing but altar-pieces -- depicting the Coronation of the\\nVirgin: a great gay scene of splendour, containing pretty angels who\\nmust have been the delight of children in church. The predella -- and\\nhere let me advise the visitor never to overlook the predellas, where\\nthe artist often throws off formality and allows his more natural\\nfeelings to have play, almost as though he painted the picture for\\nothers and the predella for himself -- is peculiarly interesting. Look,\\nat the left, at the death of an old Saint attended by monks and nuns,\\nwhose grief is profound. One other good Lorenzo is here, an \\\"Adoration\\nof the Magi,\\\" No. 39, a little out of drawing but full of life.\\n\\nBut for most people the glory of the room is not Lorenzo the Monk,\\nbut Brother Giovanni of Fiesole, known ever more as Beato, or Fra,\\nAngelico. Of that most adoring and most adorable of painters I say much\\nin the chapter on the Accademia, where he is very fully represented,\\nand it might perhaps be well to turn to those pages (227-230) and read\\nhere, on our first sight of his genius, what is said. Two Angelicos are\\nin this room -- the great triptych, opposite the chief Lorenzo, and the\\n\\\"Crowning of the Virgin,\\\" on an easel. The triptych is as much copied\\nas any picture in the gallery, not, however, for its principal figures,\\nbut for the border of twelve angels round the centre panel. Angelico's\\nbenignancy and sweetness are here, but it is not the equal of the\\n\\\"Coronation,\\\" which is a blaze of pious fervour and glory. The group\\nof saints on the right is very charming; but we are to be more pleased\\nby this radiant hand when we reach the Accademia. Already, however,\\nwe have learned his love of blue. Another altar-piece with a subtle\\nquality of its own is the early Annunciation by Simone Martini of\\nSiena (1285-1344) and Lippo Memmi, his brother (d. 1357), in which\\nthe angel speaks his golden words across the picture through a vase\\nof lilies, and the Virgin receives them shrinkingly. It is all very\\nprimitive, but it has great attraction, and it is interesting to\\nthink that the picture must be getting on for six hundred years of\\nage. This Simone was a pupil of Giotto and the painter of a portrait\\nof Petrarch's Laura, now preserved in the Laurentian library, which\\nearned him two sonnets of eulogy. It is also two Sienese painters\\nwho have made the gayest thing in this room, the predella, No. 1304,\\nby Neroccio di Siena (1447-1500) and Francesco di Giorgio di Siena\\n(1439-1502), containing scenes in the life of S. Benedetto. Neroccio\\ndid the landscape and figures; the other the architecture, and very\\nfine it is. Another delightful predella is that by Benozzo Gozzoli\\n(1420-1498), Fra Angelico's pupil, whom we have seen at the Riccardi\\npalace. Gozzoli's predella is No. 1302. Finally, look at No. 64,\\nwhich shows how prettily certain imitators of Fra Angelico could paint.\\n\\nAfter the Sala di Lorenzo Monaco let us enter the first Tuscan\\nroom. The draughtsmanship of the great Last Judgment fresco by Fra\\nBartolommeo (1475-1517) and Mariotto Albertinelli (1474-1515) is very\\nfine. It is now a ruin, but enough remains to show that it must have\\nbeen impressive. These collaborators, although intimate friends,\\nultimately went different ways, for Fra Bartolommeo came under\\nthe influence of Savonarola, burned his nude drawings, and entered\\nthe Convent of S. Marco; whereas Albertinelli, who was a convivial\\nfollower of Venus, tiring of art and even more of art jargon, took\\nan inn outside the S. Gallo gate and a tavern on the Ponte Vecchio,\\nremarking that he had found a way of life that needed no knowledge\\nof muscles, foreshortening, or perspective, and better still, was\\nwithout critics. Among his pupils was Franciabigio, whose lovely\\nMadonna of the Well we are coming to in the Tribuna.\\n\\nChief among the other pictures are two by the delightful Alessio\\nBaldovinetti, the master of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Nos. 60 and 56;\\nand a large early altar-piece by the brothers Orcagna, painted in\\n1367 for S. Maria Nuova, now the principal hospital of Florence\\nand once the home of many beautiful pictures. This work is rather\\ndingy now, but it is interesting as coming in part from the hand\\nthat designed the tabernacle in Or San Michele and the Loggia de'\\nLanzi. Another less-known painter represented here is Francesco\\nGranacci (1469-1543), the author of Nos. 1541 and 1280, both rich\\nand warm and pleasing. Granacci was a fellow-pupil of Michelangelo\\nboth in Lorenzo de' Medici's garden and in Ghirlandaio's workshop,\\nand the bosom friend of that great man all his life. Like Piero\\ndi Cosimo, Granacci was a great hand at pageantry, and Lorenzo de'\\nMedici kept him busy. He was not dependent upon art for his living,\\nbut painted for love of it, and Vasari makes him a very agreeable man.\\n\\nHere too is Gio. Antonio Sogliani (1492-1544), also a rare painter,\\nwith a finely coloured and finely drawn \\\"Disputa,\\\" No. 63. This painter\\nseems to have had the same devotion to his master, Lorenzo di Credi,\\nthat di Credi had for his master, Verrocchio. Vasari calls Sogliani a\\nworthy religious man who minded his own affairs -- a good epitaph. His\\nwork is rarely met with in Florence, but he has a large fresco at\\nS. Marco. Lorenzo di Credi (1459-1537) himself has two pretty circular\\npaintings here, of which No. 1528 is particularly sweet: \\\"The Virgin\\nand Child with St. John and Angels,\\\" all comfortable and happy in\\na Tuscan meadow; while on an easel is another circular picture, by\\nPacchiarotto (1477-1535). This has good colour and twilight beauty,\\nbut it does not touch one and is not too felicitously composed. Over\\nthe door to the Venetian room is a Cosimo Rosselli with a prettily\\naffectionate Madonna and Child.\\n\\nFrom this miscellaneous Tuscan room we pass to the two rooms which\\ncontain the Venetian pictures, of which I shall say less than might\\nperhaps be expected, not because I do not intensely admire them but\\nbecause I feel that the chief space in a Florentine book should be\\ngiven to Florentine or Tuscan things. As a matter of fact, I find\\nmyself when in the Uffizi continually drawn to revisit these walls. The\\nchief treasures are the Titians, the Giorgiones, the Mantegnas,\\nthe Carpaccio, and the Bellini allegory. These alone would make\\nthe Uffizi a Mecca of connoisseurs. Giorgione is to be found in his\\nrichest perfection at the Pitti, in his one unforgettable work that\\nis preserved there, but here he is wonderful too, with his Cavalier\\nof Malta, black and golden, and the two rich scenes, Nos. 621 and\\n630, nominally from Scripture, but really from romantic Italy. To me\\nthese three pictures are the jewels of the Venetian collection. To\\ndescribe them is impossible: enough to say that some glowing genius\\nproduced them; and whatever the experts admit, personally I prefer\\nto consider that genius Giorgione. Giorgione, who was born in 1477\\nand died young -- at thirty-three -- was, like Titian, the pupil of\\nBellini, but was greatly influenced by Leonardo da Vinci. Later he\\nbecame Titian's master. He was passionately devoted to music and to\\nladies, and it was indeed from a lady that he had his early death,\\nfor he continued to kiss her after she had taken the plague. (No bad\\nway to die, either; for to be in the power of an emotion that sways\\none to such foolishness is surely better than to live the lukewarm\\ncalculating lives of most of us.) Giorgione's claim to distinction\\nis that not only was he a glorious colourist and master of light and\\nshade, but may be said to have invented small genre pictures that\\ncould be earned about and hung in this or that room at pleasure -- such\\npictures as many of the best Dutch painters were to bend their genius\\nto almost exclusively -- his favourite subjects being music parties\\nand picnics. These Moses and Solomon pictures in the Uffizi are of\\ncourse only a pretext for gloriously coloured arrangements of people\\nwith rich scenic backgrounds. No.621 is the finer. The way in which\\nthe baby is being held in the other indicates how little Giorgione\\nthought of verisimilitude. The colour was the thing.\\n\\nAfter the Giorgiones the Titians, chief of which is No.633, \\\"The\\nMadonna and Child with S. John and S. Anthony,\\\" sometimes called the\\n\\\"Madonna of the Roses,\\\" a work which throws a pallor over all Tuscan\\npictures; No.626, the golden Flora, who glows more gloriously every\\nmoment (whom we shall see again, at the Pitti, as the Magdalen);\\nthe Duke and Duchess of Urbino, Nos.605 and 599, the Duchess set\\nat a window with what looks so curiously like a deep blue Surrey\\nlandscape through it and a village spire in the midst; and 618,\\nan unfinished Madonna and Child in which the Master's methods can\\nbe followed. The Child, completed save for the final bath of light,\\nis a miracle of draughtsmanship.\\n\\nThe triptych by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506) is of inexhaustible\\ninterest, for here, as ever, Mantegna is full of thought and\\npurpose. The left panel represents the Ascension, Christ being borne\\nupwards by eleven cherubim in a solid cloud; the right panel -- by far\\nthe best, I think -- shows the Circumcision, where the painter has set\\nhimself various difficulties of architecture and goldsmith's work\\nfor the pleasure of overcoming them, every detail being painted with\\nDutch minuteness and yet leaving the picture big; while the middle\\npanel, which is concave, depicts an Adoration of the Magi that will\\nbear much study. The whole effect is very northern: not much less\\nso than our own new National Gallery Mabuse. Mantegna also has a\\ncharming Madonna and Child, No. 1025, with pleasing pastoral and\\nstone-quarrying activities in the distance.\\n\\nOn the right of the triptych is the so-called Carpaccio (1450-1519),\\na confused but glorious melee of youths and halberds, reds and yellows\\nand browns, very modern and splendid and totally unlike anything else\\nin the whole gallery. Uccello may possibly be recalled, but only for\\nsubject. Finally there is Giovanni Bellini (1426-1516), master of\\nTitian and Giorgione, with his \\\"Sacra Conversazione,\\\" No. 631, which\\nmeans I know not what but has a haunting quality. Later we shall\\nsee a picture by Michelangelo which has been accused of blending\\nChristianity and paganism; but Bellini's sole purpose was to do\\nthis. We have children from a Bacchic vase and the crowned Virgin; two\\nnaked saints and a Venetian lady; and a centaur watching a hermit. The\\nforeground is a mosaic terrace; the background is rocks and water. It\\nis all bizarre and very curious and memorable and quite unique. For the\\nrest, I should mention two charming Guardis; a rich little Canaletto;\\na nice scene of sheep by Jacopo Bassano; the portrait of an unknown\\nyoung man by an unknown painter, No. 1157; and Tintoretto's daring\\n\\\"Abraham and Isaac\\\".\\n\\nThe other Venetian room is almost wholly devoted to portraits, chief\\namong them being a red-headed Tintoretto burning furiously, No. 613,\\nand Titian's sly and sinister Caterina Cornaro in her gorgeous dress,\\nNo. 648; Piombo's \\\"L'Uomo Ammalato\\\"; Tintoretto's Jacopo Sansovino,\\nthe sculptor, the grave old man holding his calipers who made that\\nwonderful Greek Bacchus at the Bargello; Schiavone's ripe, bearded\\n\\\"Ignoto,\\\" No. 649, and, perhaps above all, the Moroni, No. 386,\\nblack against grey. There is also Paolo Veronese's \\\"Holy Family with\\nS. Catherine,\\\" superbly masterly and golden but suggesting the Rialto\\nrather than Nazareth.\\n\\nOne picture gives the next room, the Sala di Michelangelo, its name;\\nbut entering from the Venetian room we come first on the right to a\\nvery well-known Lippo Lippi, copied in every picture shop in Florence:\\nNo. 1307, a Madonna and two Children. Few pictures are so beset by\\ndelighted observers, but apart from the perfection of it as an early\\npainting, leaving nothing to later dexterity, its appeal to me is\\nweak. The Madonna (whose head-dress, as so often in Lippo Lippi,\\nforeshadows Botticelli) and the landscape equally delight; the\\nchildren almost repel, and the decorative furniture in the corner\\nquite repels. The picture is interesting also for its colour, which\\nis unlike anything else in the gallery, the green of the Madonna's\\ndress being especially lovely and distinguished, and vulgarizing\\nthe Ghirlandaio -- No. 1297 -- which hangs next. This picture is far too\\nhot throughout, and would indeed be almost displeasing but for the\\nirradiation of the Virgin's face. The other Ghirlandaio -- No. 1295 -- in\\nthis room is far finer and sweeter; but at the Accademia and the Badia\\nwe are to see him at his best in this class of work. None the less,\\nNo. 1295 is a charming thing, and the little Mother and her happy\\nChild, whose big toe is being so reverently adored by the ancient\\nmage, are very near real simple life. This artist, we shall see,\\nalways paints healthy, honest babies. The seaport in the distance is\\ncharming too.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's place in this room is interesting on account of his\\nrelation to Michelangelo as first instructor; but by the time that the\\ngreat master's \\\"Holy Family,\\\" hanging here, was painted all traces\\nof Ghirlandaio's influence had disappeared, and if any forerunner\\nis noticeable it is Luca Signorelli. But we must first glance at\\nthe pretty little Lorenzo di Credi, No. 1160, the Annunciation,\\nan artificial work full of nice thoughts and touches, with the\\nprettiest little blue Virgin imaginable, a heavenly landscape, and\\na predella in monochrome, in one scene of which Eve rises from the\\nside of the sleeping Adam with extraordinary realism. The announcing\\nGabriel is deferential but positive; Mary is questioning but not\\nwholly surprised. In any collection of Annunciations this picture\\nwould find a prominent place.\\n\\nThe \\\"Holy Family\\\" of Michelangelo -- No. 1139 -- is remarkable for more\\nthan one reason. It is, to begin with, the only finished easel picture\\nthat exists from his brush. It is also his one work in oils, for he\\nafterwards despised that medium as being fit \\\"only for children\\\". The\\nframe is contemporary and was made for it, the whole being commissioned\\nby Angelo Doni, a wealthy connoisseur whose portrait by Raphael we\\nshall see in the Pitti, and who, according to Vasari, did his best to\\nget it cheaper than his bargain, and had in the end to pay dearer. The\\nperiod of the picture is about 1503, while the great David was in\\nprogress, when the painter was twenty-eight. That it is masterly and\\nsuperb there can be no doubt, but, like so much of Michelangelo's\\nwork, it suffers from its author's greatness. There is an austerity\\nof power here that ill consorts with the tender domesticity of the\\nscene, and the Child is a young Hercules. The nude figures in the\\nbackground introduce an alien element and suggest the conflict between\\nChristianity and paganism, the new religion and the old: in short, the\\nTwilight of the Gods. Whether Michelangelo intended this we shall not\\nknow; but there it is. The prevailing impression left by the picture\\nis immense power and virtuosity and no religion. In the beautiful Luca\\nSignorelli -- No.74 -- next it, we find at once a curious similarity and\\ndifference. The Madonna and Child only are in the foreground, a not\\ntoo radiant but very tender couple; in the background are male figures\\nnearly nude: not quite, as Michelangelo made them, and suggesting\\nno discord as in his picture. Luca was born in 1441, and was thus\\nthirty-four years older than Michelangelo. This picture is perhaps that\\none presented by Luca to Lorenzo de' Medici, of which Vasari tells, and\\nif so it was probably on a wall in the Medici palace when Michelangelo\\nas a boy was taught with Lorenzo's sons. Luca's sweetness was alien\\nto Michelangelo, but not his melancholy or his sense of composition;\\nwhile Luca's devotion to the human form as the unit of expression\\nwas in Michelangelo carried out to its highest power. Vasari, who\\nwas a relative of Luca's and a pupil of Michelangelo's, says that\\nhis master had the greatest admiration for Luca's genius.\\n\\nLuca Signorelli was born at Cortona, and was instructed by Piero della\\nFrancesca, whose one Uffizi painting is in a later room. His chief work\\nis at Cortona, at Rome (in the Sixtine Chapel), and at Orvieto. His\\nfame was sufficient in Florence in 1491 for him to be made one of\\nthe judges of the designs for the fa\\u00e7ade of the Duomo. Luca lived\\nto a great age, not dying till 1524, and was much beloved. He was\\nmagnificent in his habits and loved fine clothes, was very kindly\\nand helpful in disposition, and the influence of his naturalness and\\nsincerity upon art was great. One very pretty sad story is told of him,\\nto the effect that when his son, whom he had dearly loved, was killed\\nat Cortona, he caused the body to be stripped, and painted it with the\\nutmost exactitude, that through his own handiwork he might be able\\nto contemplate that treasure of which fate had robbed him. Perhaps\\nthe most beautiful or at any rate the most idiosyncratic thing in the\\npicture before us is its lovely profusion of wayside flowers. These\\ncome out but poorly in the photograph, but in the painting they\\nare exquisite both in form and in detail. Luca painted them as if\\nhe loved them. (There is a hint of the same thoughtful care in the\\nflowers in No. 1133, by Luca, in our National Gallery; but these at\\nFlorence are the best.) No. 74 is in tempera: the next, also by Luca,\\nNo.1291, is in oil, a \\\"Holy Family,\\\" a work at once powerful, rich,\\nand sweet. Here, again, we may trace an influence on Michelangelo,\\nfor the child is shown deprecating a book which his mother is\\ndisplaying, while in the beautiful marble tondo of the \\\"Madonna and\\nChild\\\" by Michelangelo, which we are soon to see in the Bargello,\\na reading lesson is in progress, and the child wearying of it. We\\nfind Luca again in the next large picture -- No.1547 -- a Crucifixion,\\nwith various Saints, done in collaboration with Perugino. The design\\nsuggests Luca rather than his companion, and the woman at the foot of\\nthe cross is surely the type of which he was so fond. The drawing of\\nChrist is masterly and all too sombre for Perugino. Finally, there is\\na Luca predella, No. 1298, representing the Annunciation, the Birth\\nof Christ (in which Joseph is older almost than in any version), and\\nthe Adoration of the Magi, all notable for freedom and richness. Note\\nthe realism and charm and the costume of the two pages of the Magi.\\n\\nAnd now we come to what is perhaps the most lovely picture in the whole\\ngallery, judged purely as colour and sweetness and design -- No.1549 -- a\\n\\\"Madonna Adoring,\\\" with Filippino Lippi's name and an interrogation\\nmark beneath it. Who painted it if not Filippino? That is the question;\\nbut into such problems, which confront one at every turn in Florence,\\nI am neither qualified nor anxious to enter. When doctors disagree any\\none may decide before me. The thought, moreover, that always occurs\\nin the presence of these good debatable pictures, is that any doubt\\nas to their origin merely enriches this already over-rich period,\\nsince some one had to paint them. Simon not pure becomes hardly less\\nremarkable than Simon pure.\\n\\nIf only the Baby were more pleasing, this would be perhaps the most\\ndelightful picture in the world: as it is, its blues alone lift it to\\nthe heavens of delectableness. By an unusual stroke of fortune a crack\\nin the paint where the panels join has made a star in the tender blue\\nsky. The Tuscan landscape is very still and beautiful; the flowers,\\nalthough conventional and not accurate like Luca's, are as pretty\\nas can be; the one unsatisfying element is the Baby, who is a little\\nclumsy and a little in pain, but diffuses radiance none the less. And\\nthe Mother -- the Mother is all perfection and winsomeness. Her face\\nand hands are exquisite, and the Tuscan twilight behind her is so\\nlovely. I have given a reproduction, but colour is essential.\\n\\nThe remaining three pictures in the room are a Bastiano and a\\nPollaiolo, which are rather for the student than for the wanderer,\\nand a charming Ignoto, No. 75, which I like immensely. But Ignoto\\nnearly always paints well.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Leonardo are two pictures which bear the name of\\nthis most fascinating of all the painters of the world. One is the\\nAnnunciation, No. 1288, upon the authenticity of which much has been\\nsaid and written, and the other an unfinished Adoration of the Magi\\nwhich cannot be questioned by anyone. The probabilities are that the\\nAnnunciation is an early work and that the ascription is accurate:\\nat Oxford is a drawing known to be Leonardo's that is almost certainly\\na study for a detail of this work, while among the Leonardo drawings\\nin the His de la Salle collection at the Louvre is something very\\nlike a first sketch of the whole. Certainly one can think of no one\\nelse who could have given the picture its quality, which increases\\nin richness with every visit to the gallery; but the workshop of\\nVerrocchio, where Leonardo worked, together with Lorenzo di Credi and\\nPerugino, with Andrea of the True Eye over all, no doubt put forth\\nwonderful things. The Annunciation is unique in the collection, both\\nin colour and character: nothing in the Uffizi so deepens. There are\\nno cypresses like these in any other picture, no finer drawing than\\nthat of Mary's hands. Luca's flowers are better, in the adjoining\\nroom; one is not too happy about the pedestal of the reading-desk;\\nand there are Virgins whom we can like more; but as a whole it is\\nperhaps the most fascinating picture of all, for it has the Leonardo\\ndarkness as well as light.\\n\\nOf Leonardo I could write for ever, but this book is not the place;\\nfor though he was a Florentine, Florence has very little of his work:\\nthese pictures only, and one of these only for certain, together\\nwith an angel in a work by Verrocchio at the Accademia which we\\nshall see, and possibly a sculptured figure over the north door of\\nthe Baptistery. Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Francis I of\\nFrance, lured him away, to the eternal loss of his own city. It is\\nMilan and Paris that are richest in his work, and after that London,\\nwhich has at South Kensington a sculptured relief by him as well as\\na painting at the National Gallery, a cartoon at Burlington House,\\nand the British Museum drawings.\\n\\nHis other work here -- No. 1252 -- in the grave brown frame, was to have\\nbeen Leonardo's greatest picture in oil, so Vasari says: larger, in\\nfact, than any known picture at that time. Being very indistinct,\\nit is, curiously enough, best as the light begins to fail and the\\nbeautiful wistful faces emerge from the gloom. In their presence one\\nrecalls Leonardo's remark in one of his notebooks that faces are most\\ninteresting beneath a troubled sky. \\\"You should make your portrait,\\\"\\nhe adds, \\\"at the hour of the fall of the evening when it is cloudy\\nor misty, for the light then is perfect.\\\" In the background one can\\ndiscern the prancing horses of the Magi's suite; a staircase with\\nfigures ascending and descending; the rocks and trees of Tuscany;\\nand looking at it one cannot but ponder upon the fatality which seems\\nto have pursued this divine and magical genius, ordaining that almost\\neverything that he put forth should be either destroyed or unfinished:\\nhis work in the Castello at Milan, which might otherwise be an eighth\\nwonder of the world, perished; his \\\"Last Supper\\\" at Milan perishing;\\nhis colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza broken to pieces;\\nhis sculpture lost; his Palazzo Vecchio battle cartoon perished;\\nthis picture only a sketch. Even after long years the evil fate still\\npersists, for in 1911 his \\\"Gioconda\\\" was stolen from the Louvre by\\nmadman or knave.\\n\\nAmong the other pictures in this room is the rather hot \\\"Adoration\\nof the Magi,\\\" by Cosimo Rosselli (1439-1507), over the Leonardo\\n\\\"Annunciation,\\\" a glowing scene of colour and animation: this Cosimo\\nbeing the Cosimo from whom Piero di Cosimo took his name, and an\\nassociate of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and Luca Signorelli\\non the Sixtine Chapel frescoes. On the left wall is Uccello's battle\\npiece, No. 52, very like that in our National Gallery: rich and\\nglorious as decoration, but quite bearing out Vasari's statement that\\nUccello could not draw horses. Uccello was a most laborious student\\nof animal life and so absorbed in the mysteries of perspective that\\nhe preferred them to bed; but he does not seem to have been able to\\nunite them. He was a perpetual butt of Donatello. It is told of him\\nthat having a commission to paint a fresco for the Mercato Vecchio\\nhe kept the progress of the work a secret and allowed no one to\\nsee it. At last, when it was finished, he drew aside the sheet for\\nDonatello, who was buying fruit, to admire. \\\"Ah, Paolo,\\\" said the\\nsculptor reproachfully, \\\"now that you ought to be covering it up,\\nyou uncover it.\\\"\\n\\nThere remain a superb nude study of Venus by Lorenzo di Credi,\\nNo. 3452 -- one of the pictures which escaped Savonarola's bonfire\\nof vanities, and No. 1305, a Virgin and Child with various Saints\\nby Domenico Veneziano (1400-1461), who taught Gentile da Fabriano,\\nthe teacher of Jacopo Bellini. This picture is a complete contrast to\\nthe Uccello: for that is all tapestry, richness, and belligerence,\\nand this is so pale and gentle, with its lovely light green, a rare\\ncolour in this gallery.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nThe Uffizi III: Botticelli\\n\\nA painter apart -- Sandro Filipepi -- Artists' names -- Piero de' Medici -- The\\n\\\"Adoration of the Magi\\\" -- The \\\"Judith\\\" pictures -- Lucrezia Tornabuoni,\\nLorenzo and Giuliano's mother -- The Tournaments -- The \\\"Birth of Venus\\\"\\nand the \\\"Primavera\\\" -- Simonetta -- A new star -- Sacred pictures -- Savonarola\\nand \\\"The Calumny\\\" -- The National Gallery -- Botticelli's old age and\\ndeath.\\n\\nWe come next to the Sala di Botticelli, and such is the position\\nheld by this painter in the affection of visitors to Florence, and\\nsuch the wealth of works from his hand that the Uffizi possesses,\\nthat I feel that a single chapter may well be devoted to his genius,\\nmore particularly as many of his pictures were so closely associated\\nwith Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici. We see Botticelli here\\nat his most varied. The Accademia also is very rich in his work,\\nhaving above all the \\\"Primavera,\\\" and in this chapter I shall glance\\nat the Accademia pictures too, returning to them when we reach that\\ngallery in due course. Among the great Florentine masters Botticelli\\nstands apart by reason not only of the sensitive wistful delicacy\\nof his work, but for the profound interest of his personality. He\\nis not essentially more beautiful than his friend Filippino Lippi\\nor -- occasionally -- than Fra Lippo Lippi his master; but he is always\\ndeeper. One feels that he too felt the emotion that his characters\\ndisplay; he did not merely paint, he thought and suffered. Hence his\\nwork is dramatic. Again Botticelli had far wider sympathies than most\\nof his contemporaries. He was a friend of the Medici, a neo-Platonist,\\na student of theology with the poet Palmieri, an illustrator of Dante,\\nand a devoted follower of Savonarola. Of the part that women played\\nin his life we know nothing: in fact we know less of him intimately\\nthan of almost any of the great painters; but this we may guess, that\\nhe was never a happy man. His work falls naturally into divisions\\ncorresponding to his early devotion to Piero de' Medici and his\\nwife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, in whose house for a while he lived; to\\nhis interest in their sons Lorenzo and Giuliano; and finally to his\\nbelief in Savonarola. Sublime he never is; comforting he never is;\\nbut he is everything else. One can never forget in his presence the\\ntragedy that attends the too earnest seeker after beauty: not \\\"all\\nis vanity\\\" does Botticelli say, but \\\"all is transitory\\\".\\n\\nBotticelli, as we now call him, was the son of Mariano Filipepi and\\nwas born in Florence in 1447. According to one account he was called\\nSandro di Botticelli because he was apprenticed to a goldsmith of\\nthat name; according to another his brother Antonio, a goldsmith,\\nwas known as Botticello (which means a little barrel), and Sandro\\nbeing with him was called Sandro di Botticello. Whatever the cause,\\nthe fact remains that the name of Filipepi is rarely used.\\n\\nAnd here a word as to the capriciousness of the nomenclature of\\nartists. We know some by their Christian names; some by their surnames;\\nsome by their nicknames; some by the names of their towns, and some\\nby the names of their masters. Tommaso Bigordi, a goldsmith, was so\\nclever in designing a pretty garland for women's hair that he was\\ncalled Ghirlandaio, the garland-maker, and his painter son Domenico\\nis therefore known for ever as Uomenico Ghirlandaio. Paolo Doni, a\\npainter of battle scenes, was so fond of birds that he was known as\\nUccello (a bird) and now has no other name; Pietro Vannucci coming\\nfrom Perugia was called Perugino; Agnolo di Francesco di Migliore\\nhappened to be a tailor with a genius of a son, Andrea; that genius is\\ntherefore Andrea of the Tailor -- del Sarto -- for all time. And so forth.\\n\\nTo return to Botticelli. In 1447, when he was born, Fra Angelico\\nwas sixty; and Masaccio had been dead for some years. At the age\\nof twelve the boy was placed with Fra Lippo Lippi, then a man of\\na little more than fifty, to learn painting. That Lippo was his\\nmaster one may see continually, but particularly by comparison of\\nhis headdresses with almost any of Botticelli's. Both were minutely\\ncareful in this detail. But where Lippo was beautifully obvious,\\nSandro was beautifully analytical: he was also, as I have said,\\nmuch more interesting and dramatic.\\n\\nBotticelli's best patron was Piero de' Medici, who took him into\\nhis house, much as his son Lorenzo was to take Michelangelo into\\nhis, and made him one of the family. For Piero, Botticelli always\\nhad affection and respect, and when he painted his \\\"Fortitude\\\" as\\none of the Pollaiuoli's series of the Virtues for the Mercatanzia\\n(of which several are in this gallery), he made the figure symbolize\\nPiero's life and character -- or so it is possible, if one wishes to\\nbelieve. But it should be understood that almost nothing is known\\nabout Botticelli and the origin of his pictures. At Piero's request\\nBotticelli painted the \\\"Adoration of the Magi\\\" (No. 1286) which was\\nto hang in S. Maria Novella as an offering of gratitude for Piero's\\nescape from the conspiracy of Luca Pitti in 1466. Piero had but just\\nsucceeded to Cosimo when Pitti, considering him merely an invalid,\\nstruck his blow. By virtue largely of the young Lorenzo's address\\nthe attack miscarried: hence the presence of Lorenzo in the picture,\\non the extreme left, with a sword. Piero himself in scarlet kneels\\nin the middle; Giuliano, his second son, doomed to an early death by\\nassassination, is kneeling on his right. The picture is not only a\\nsacred painting but (like the Gozzoli fresco at the Riccardi palace)\\nan exaltation of the Medici family. The dead Cosimo is at the Child's\\nfeet; the dead Giovanni, Piero's brother, stands close to the kneeling\\nGiuliano. Among the other persons represented are collateral Medici\\nand certain of their friends.\\n\\nIt is by some accepted that the figure in yellow, on the extreme right,\\nlooking out of this picture, is Botticelli himself. But for a portrait\\nof the painter of more authenticity we must go to the Carmine, where,\\nin the Brancacci chapel, we shall see a fresco by Botticelli's friend\\nFilippino Lippi representing the Crucifixion of S. Peter, in which\\nour painter is depicted on the right, looking on at the scene -- a\\nrather coarse heavy face, with a large mouth and long hair. He wears\\na purple cap and red cloak. Vasari tells us that Botticelli, although\\nso profoundly thoughtful and melancholy in his work, was extravagant,\\npleasure loving, and given to practical jokes. Part at least of this\\nmight be gathered from observation of Filippino Lippi's portrait of\\nhim. According to Vasari it was No. 1286 which brought Botticelli his\\ninvitation to Rome from Sixtus IV to decorate the Sixtine Chapel. But\\nthat was several years later and much was to happen in the interval.\\n\\nThe two little \\\"Judith\\\" pictures (Nos. 1156 and 1158) were painted for\\nPiero de' Medici and had their place in the Medici palace. In 1494,\\nwhen Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici was banished from Florence and the\\npalace looted, they were stolen and lost sight of; but during the reign\\nof Francis I they reappeared and were presented to his wife Bianca\\nCapella and once more placed with the Medici treasures. No. 1156,\\nthe Judith walking springily along, sword in hand, having slain the\\ntyrant, is one of the masterpieces of paint. Everything about it is\\nradiant, superb, and unforgettable.\\n\\nOne other picture which the young painter made for his patron -- or in\\nthis case his patroness, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Piero's wife -- is the\\n\\\"Madonna of the Magnificat,\\\" No. 1267, with its beautiful children and\\nsweet Madonna, its lovely landscape but not too attractive Child. The\\ntwo boys are Lorenzo, on the left, and Giuliano, in yellow. One\\nof their sisters leans over them. Here the boys are perhaps, in\\nBotticelli's way, typified rather than portrayed. Although this\\npicture came so early in his career Botticelli never excelled its\\nrichness, beauty, and depth of feeling, nor its liquid delicacy of\\ntreatment. Lucrezia Tornabuoni, for whom he painted it, was a very\\nremarkable woman, not only a good mother to her children and a good\\nwife to Piero, but a poet and exemplar. She survived Piero by thirteen\\nyears and her son Giuliano by five. Botticelli painted her portrait,\\nwhich is now in Berlin.\\n\\nThese pictures are the principal work of Botticelli's first period,\\nwhich coincides with the five years of Piero's rule and the period\\nof mourning for him.\\n\\nHe next appears in what many of his admirers find his most fascinating\\nmood, as a joyous allegorist, the picture of Venus rising from\\nthe sea in this room, the \\\"Primavera\\\" which we shall see at the\\nAccademia, and the \\\"Mars and Venus\\\" in our National Gallery,\\nbelonging to this epoch. But in order to understand them we must\\nagain go to history. Piero was succeeded in 1469 by his son Lorenzo\\nthe Magnificent, who continued his father's friendship for the young\\npainter, now twenty-two years of age. In 1474 Lorenzo devised for his\\nbrother Giuliano a tournament in the Piazza of S. Croce very like that\\nwhich Piero had given for Lorenzo on the occasion of his betrothal\\nin 1469; and Botticelli was commissioned by Lorenzo to make pictures\\ncommemorating the event. Verrocchio again helped with the costumes;\\nLucrezia Donati again was Queen of the Tournament; but the Queen of\\nBeauty was the sixteen-year-old bride of Marco Vespucci -- the lovely\\nSimonetta Cattaneo, a lady greatly beloved by all and a close friend\\nboth of Giuliano and Lorenzo.\\n\\nThe praises of Lorenzo's tournament had been sung by Luca Pulci:\\nGiuliano's were sung by Poliziano, under the title \\\"La Giostra di\\nGiuliano de' Medici,\\\" and it is this poem which Botticelli may be\\nsaid to have illustrated, for both poet and artist employ the same\\nimagery. Thus Poliziano, or Politian (of whom we shall hear more in the\\nchapter on S. Marco) compares Simonetta to Venus, and in stanzas 100\\nand 101 speaks of her birth, describing her blown to earth over the\\nsea by the breath of the Zephyrs, and welcomed there by the Hours,\\none of whom offers her a robe. This, Botticelli translates into\\nexquisite tempera with a wealth of pretty thoughts. The cornflowers\\nand daisies on the Hour's dress are alone a perennial joy.\\n\\nSimonetta as Venus has some of the wistfulness of the Madonnas;\\nand not without reason does Botticelli give her this expression, for\\nher days were very short. In the \\\"Primavera,\\\" which we are to see at\\nthe Accademia, but which must be described here, we find Simonetta\\nagain but we do not see her first. We see first that slender upright\\ncommanding figure, all flowers and youth and conquest, in her lovely\\nfloral dress, advancing over the grass like thistle-down. Never\\nbefore in painting had anything been done at once so distinguished\\nand joyous and pagan as this. For a kindred emotion one had to go to\\nGreek sculpture, but Botticelli, while his grace and joy are Hellenic,\\nwas intensely modern too: the problems of the Renaissance, the tragedy\\nof Christianity, equally cloud his brow.\\n\\nThe symbolism of the \\\"Primavera\\\" is interesting. Glorious Spring is\\nreturning to earth -- in the presence of Venus -- once more to make all\\nglad, and with her her attendants to dance and sing, and the Zephyrs\\nto bring the soft breezes; and by Spring Botticelli meant the reign\\nof Lorenzo, whose tournament motto was \\\"Le temps revient\\\". Simonetta\\nis again the central figure, and never did Botticelli paint more\\nexquisitely than here. Her bosom is the prettiest in Florence; the\\nlining of her robe over her right arm has such green and blue and\\ngold as never were seen elsewhere; her golden sandals are delicate\\nas gossamer. Over her head a little cupid hovers, directing his arrow\\nat Mercury, on the extreme left, beside the three Graces.\\n\\nIn Mercury, who is touching the trees with his caduceus and\\nbidding them burgeon, some see Giuliano de' Medici, who was not yet\\nbetrothed. But when the picture was painted both Giuliano and Simonetta\\nwere dead: Simonetta first, of consumption, in 1476, and Giuliano, by\\nstabbing in 1478. Lorenzo, who was at Pisa during Simonetta's illness,\\ndetailed his own physician for her care. On hearing of her death he\\nwalked out into the night and noticed for the first time a brilliant\\nstar. \\\"See,\\\" he said, \\\"either the soul of that most gentle lady\\nhath been transferred into that new star or else hath it been joined\\ntogether thereunto.\\\" Of Giuliano's end we have read in Chapter II,\\nand it was Botticelli, whose destinies were so closely bound up with\\nthe Medici, who was commissioned to paint portraits of the murderous\\nPazzi to be displayed outside the Palazzo Vecchio.\\n\\nA third picture in what may be called the tournament period is found by\\nsome in the \\\"Venus and Mars,\\\" No. 915, in our National Gallery. Here\\nGiuliano would be Mars, and Venus either one woman in particular\\nwhom Florence wished him to marry, or all women, typified by one,\\ntrying to lure him from other pre-occupations, such as hunting. To\\nmake her Simonetta is to go too far; for she is not like the Simonetta\\nof the other pictures, and Simonetta was but recently married and a\\nvery model of fair repute. In No. 916 in the National Gallery is a\\n\\\"Venus with Cupids\\\" (which might be by Botticelli and might be by that\\ninteresting painter of whom Mr. Berenson has written so attractively\\nas Amico di Sandro), in which Politian's description of Venus, in\\nhis poem, is again closely followed.\\n\\nAfter the tournament pictures we come in Botticelli's career to the\\nSixtine Chapel frescoes, and on his return to Florence to other\\nfrescoes, including that lovely one at the Villa Lemmi (then the\\nVilla Tornabuoni) which is now on the staircase of the Louvre. These\\nare followed by at least two more Medici pictures -- the portrait of\\nPiero di Lorenzo de' Medici, in this room, No. 1154, the sad-faced\\nyouth with the medal; and the \\\"Pallas and the Centaur\\\" at the Pitti,\\nan historical record of Lorenzo's success as a diplomatist when he\\nwent to Naples in 1480.\\n\\nThe latter part of Botticelli's life was spent under the influence\\nof Savonarola and in despair at the wickedness of the world and its\\ntreatment of that prophet. His pictures became wholly religious, but\\nit was religion without joy. Never capable of disguising the sorrow\\nthat underlies all human happiness -- or, as I think of it in looking\\nat his work, the sense of transience -- Botticelli, as age came upon\\nhim, was more than ever depressed. One has the feeling that he was\\npersuaded that only through devotion and self-negation could peace of\\nmind be gained, and yet for himself could find none. The sceptic was\\ntoo strong in him. Savonarola's eloquence could not make him serene,\\nhowever much he may have come beneath its spell. It but served to\\nincrease his melancholy. Hence these wistful despondent Madonnas, all\\nso conscious of the tragedy before their Child; hence these troubled\\nangels and shadowed saints.\\n\\nSavonarola was hanged and burned in 1498, and Botticelli paid\\na last tribute to his friend in the picture in this room called\\n\\\"The Calumny\\\". Under the pretence of merely illustrating a passage\\nin Lucian, who was one of his favourite authors, Botticelli has\\nrepresented the campaign against the great reformer. The hall\\nrepresents Florence; the judge (with the ears of an ass) the\\nSignoria and the Pope. Into these ears Ignorance and Suspicion\\nare whispering. Calumny, with Envy at her side and tended by Fraud\\nand Deception, holds a torch in one hand and with the other drags\\nher victim, who personifies (but with no attempt at a likeness)\\nSavonarola. Behind are the figures of Remorse, cloaked and miserable,\\nand Truth, naked and unafraid. The statues in the niches ironically\\nrepresent abstract virtues. Everything in the decoration of the palace\\npoints to enlightenment and content; and beyond is the calmest and\\ngreenest of seas.\\n\\nOne more picture was Botticelli to paint, and this also was to\\nthe glory of Savonarola. By good fortune it belongs to the English\\npeople and is No. 1034 in the National Gallery. It has upon it a\\nGreek inscription in the painter's own hand which runs in English\\nas follows: \\\"This picture I, Alessandro, painted at the end of the\\nyear 1500, in the troubles of Italy, in the half-time after the time\\nduring the fulfilment of the eleventh of St. John, in the second\\nwoe of the Apocalypse, in the loosing of the devil for three years\\nand a half. Afterwards he shall be confined, and we shall see him\\ntrodden down, as in this picture.\\\" The loosing of the devil was the\\nthree years and a half after Savonarola's execution on May 23rd,\\n1498, when Florence was mad with reaction from the severity of his\\ndiscipline. S. John says, \\\"I will give power unto my two witnesses,\\nand they shall prophesy\\\"; the painter makes three, Savonarola having\\nhad two comrades with him. The picture was intended to give heart to\\nthe followers of Savonarola and bring promise of ultimate triumph.\\n\\nAfter the death of Savonarola, Botticelli became both poor and\\ninfirm. He had saved no money and all his friends were dead -- Piero de'\\nMedici, Lorenzo, Giuliano, Lucrezia, Simonetta, Filippino Lippi, and\\nSavonarola. He hobbled about on crutches for a while, a pensioner of\\nthe Medici family, and dying at the age of seventy-eight was buried\\nin Ognissanti, but without a tombstone for fear of desecration by\\nthe enemies of Savonarola's adherents.\\n\\nSuch is the outline of Botticelli's life. We will now look at such\\nof the pictures in this room as have not been mentioned.\\n\\nEntering from the Sala di Leonardo, the first picture on the right is\\nthe \\\"Birth of Venus\\\". Then the very typical circular picture -- a shape\\nwhich has come to be intimately associated with this painter -- No. 1289,\\n\\\"The Madonna of the Pomegranate,\\\" one of his most beautiful works,\\nand possibly yet another designed for Lucrezia Tornabuoni, for the\\ncurl on the forehead of the boy to the left of the Madonna -- who is\\nmore than usually troubled -- is very like that for which Giuliano de'\\nMedici was famous. This is a very lovely work, although its colour\\nis a little depressed. Next is the most remarkable of the Piero de'\\nMedici pictures, which I have already touched upon -- No. 1286, \\\"The\\nAdoration of the Magi,\\\" as different from the Venus as could be:\\nthe Venus so cool and transparent, and this so hot and rich, with\\nits haughty Florentines and sumptuous cloaks. Above it is No. 23,\\na less subtle group -- the Madonna, the Child and angels -- difficult to\\nsee. And then comes the beautiful \\\"Magnificat,\\\" which we know to have\\nbeen painted for Lucrezia Tornabuoni and which shall here introduce a\\npassage from Pater: \\\"For with Botticelli she too, although she holds in\\nher hands the 'Desire of all nations,' is one of those who are neither\\nfor Jehovah nor for His enemies; and her choice is on her face. The\\nwhite light on it is cast up hard and cheerless from below, as when\\nsnow lies upon the ground, and the children look up with surprise\\nat the strange whiteness of the ceiling. Her trouble is in the very\\ncaress of the mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her,\\nand who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never\\nbeen able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an\\nobject almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he\\nguides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her exaltation,\\nthe 'Ave,' and the 'Magnificat,' and the 'Gaude Maria,' and the young\\nangels, glad to rouse her for a moment from her devotion, are eager\\nto hold the ink-horn and to support the book. But the pen almost\\ndrops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her,\\nand her true children are those others among whom, in her rude home,\\nthe intolerable honour came to her, with that look of wistful inquiry\\non their irregular faces which you see in startled animals -- gipsy\\nchildren, such as those who, in Apennine villages, still hold out\\ntheir long brown arms to beg of you, with their thick black hair\\nnicely combed, and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats.\\\"\\n\\nThe picture's frame is that which was made for it four hundred and\\nfifty years ago: by whom, I cannot say, but it was the custom at that\\ntime for the painter himself to be responsible also for the frame.\\n\\nThe glory of the end wall is the \\\"Annunciation,\\\" reproduced in this\\nbook. The picture is a work that may perhaps not wholly please at\\nfirst, the cause largely of the vermilion on the floor, but in the\\nend conquers. The hands are among the most beautiful in existence,\\nand the landscape, with its one tree and its fairy architecture, is a\\ncontinual delight. Among \\\"Annunciations,\\\" as among pictures, it stands\\nvery high. It has more of sophistication than most: the Virgin not\\nonly recognizes the honour, but the doom, which the painter himself\\nforeshadows in the predella, where Christ is seen rising from the\\ngrave. None of Fra Angelico's simple radiance here, and none of Fra\\nLippo Lippi's glorified matter-of-fact. Here is tragedy. The painting\\nof the Virgin's head-dress is again marvellous.\\n\\nNext the \\\"Annunciation\\\" on the left is, to my eyes, one of Botticelli's\\nmost attractive works: No. 1303, just the Madonna and Child again,\\nin a niche, with roses climbing behind them: the Madonna one of his\\nyoungest, and more placid and simple than most, with more than a hint\\nof the Verrocchio type in her face. To the \\\"School of Botticelli\\\" this\\nis sometimes attributed: it may be rightly. Its pendant is another\\n\\\"Madonna and Child,\\\" No. 76, more like Lippo Lippi and very beautiful\\nin its darker graver way.\\n\\nThe other wall has the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" the \\\"Calumny,\\\" and the two little\\n\\\"Judith and Holofernes\\\" pictures. Upon the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" to which I\\nhave already alluded, it is well to look at Ruskin, who, however,\\nwas not aware that the artist intended any symbolic reference to\\nthe character and career of Piero de' Medici. The criticism is in\\n\\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" and it is followed by some fine pages on the\\n\\\"Judith\\\". The \\\"Justice,\\\" \\\"Prudence,\\\" and \\\"Charity\\\" of the Pollaiuolo\\nbrothers, belonging to the same series as the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" are also\\nhere; but after the \\\"Fortitude\\\" one does not look at them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nthe Uffizi IV: Remaining Rooms\\n\\nS. Zenobius -- Piero della Francesca -- Federigo da Montefeltro -- Melozzo\\nda Forli -- The Tribuna -- Raphael -- Re-arrangement -- The gems -- The\\nself-painted portraits -- A northern room -- Hugo van der Goes -- \\nTommaso Portinari -- The sympathetic Memling -- Rubens riotous -- Vittoria\\ndella Rovere -- Baroccio -- Honthorst -- Giovanni the indiscreet -- The\\nMedusa -- Medici miniatures -- Hercules Seghers -- The Sala di Niobe -- \\nBeautiful antiques.\\n\\nPassing from the Sala di Botticelli through the Sala di Lorenzo\\nMonaco and the first Tuscan rooms to the corridor, we come to\\nthe second Tuscan room, which is dominated by Andrea del Sarto\\n(1486-1531), whose \\\"Madonna and Child,\\\" with \\\"S. Francis and S. John\\nthe Evangelist\\\" -- No. 112 -- is certainly the favourite picture here,\\nas it is, in reproduction, in so many homes; but, apart from the\\nChild, I like far better the \\\"S. Giacomo\\\" -- No. 1254 -- so sympathetic\\nand rich in colour, which is reproduced in this volume. Another\\ngood Andrea is No. 93 -- a soft and misty apparition of Christ to\\nthe Magdalen. The Sodoma (1477-1549) on the easel -- \\\"S. Sebastian,\\\"\\nNo. 1279 -- is very beautiful in its Leonardesque hues and romantic\\nlandscape, and the two Ridolfo Ghirlandaios (1483-1561) near it are\\ninteresting as representing, with much hard force, scenes in the story\\nof S. Zenobius, of Florence, of whom we read in chapter II. In one he\\nrestores life to the dead child in the midst of a Florentine crowd;\\nin the other his bier, passing the Baptistery, reanimates the dead\\ntree. Giotto's tower and the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio are to be\\nseen on the left. A very different picture is the Cosimo Rosselli,\\nNo. 1280 his, a comely \\\"Madonna and Saints,\\\" with a motherly thought\\nin the treatment of the bodice.\\n\\nAmong the other pictures is a naked sprawling scene of bodies and\\nlimbs by Cosimo I's favourite painter, Bronzino (1502-1572), called\\n\\\"The Saviour in Hell,\\\" and two nice Medici children from the same\\nbrush, which was kept busy both on the living and ancestral lineaments\\nof that family; two Filippino Lippis, both fine if with a little\\ntoo much colour for this painter: one -- No. 1257 -- approaching the\\nhotness of a Ghirlandaio carpet piece, but a great feat of crowded\\nactivity; the other, No. 1268, having a beautiful blue Madonna and\\na pretty little cherub with a red book. Piero di Cosimo is here,\\nreligious and not mythological; and here are a very straightforward\\nand satisfying Mariotto Albertinelli -- the \\\"Virgin and S. Elizabeth,\\\"\\nvery like a Fra Bartolommeo; a very rich and beautiful \\\"Deposition\\\"\\nby Botticini, one of Verrocchio's pupils, with a gay little predella\\nunderneath it, and a pretty \\\"Holy Family\\\" by Franciabigio. But Andrea\\nremains the king of the walls.\\n\\nFrom this Sala a little room is gained which I advise all\\ntired visitors to the Uffizi to make their harbour of refuge and\\nrecuperation; for it has only three or four pictures in it and three\\nor four pieces of sculpture and some pleasant maps and tapestry\\non the walls, and from its windows you look across the brown-red\\ntiles to S. Miniato. The pictures, although so few, are peculiarly\\nattractive, being the work of two very rare hands, Piero della\\nFrancesca (? 1398-1492) and Melozzo da Forli (1438-1494). Melozzo\\nhas here a very charming Annunciation in two panels, the fascination\\nof which I cannot describe. That they are fascinating there is,\\nhowever, no doubt. We have symbolical figures by him in our National\\nGallery -- again hanging next to Piero della Francesca -- but they are not\\nthe equal of these in charm, although very charming. These grow more\\nattractive with every visit: the eager advancing angel with his lily,\\nand the timid little Virgin in her green dress, with folded hands.\\n\\nThe two Pieros are, of course, superb. Piero never painted anything\\nthat was not distinguished and liquid, and here he gives us of\\nhis best: portraits of Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and\\nBattista, his second Duchess, with classical scenes behind them. Piero\\ndella Francesca has ever been one of my favourite painters, and here he\\nis wholly a joy. Of his works Florence has but few, since he was not\\na Florentine, nor did he work here, being engaged chiefly at Urbino,\\nFerrara, Arezzo, and Rome. His life ended sadly, for he became totally\\nblind. In addition to his painting he was a mathematician of much\\nrepute. The Duke of Urbino here depicted is Federigo da Montefeltro,\\nwho ruled from 1444 to 1482, and in 1459 married as his second wife\\na daughter of Alessandro Sforza, of Pesaro, the wedding being the\\noccasion of Piero's pictures. The duke stands out among the many\\nItalian lords of that time as a humane and beneficent ruler and\\ncollector, and eager to administer well. He was a born fighter, and it\\nwas owing to the loss of his right eye and the fracture of his noble\\nold nose that he is seen here in such a determined profile against\\nthe lovely light over the Umbrian hills. The symbolical chariots in\\nthe landscape at the back represent respectively the Triumph of Fame\\n(the Duke's) and the Triumph of Chastity (that of the Duchess). The\\nDuke's companions are Victory, Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and\\nTemperance; the little Duchess's are Love, Hope, Faith, Charity,\\nand Innocence; and if these are not exquisite pictures I never saw any.\\n\\nThe statues in the room should not be missed, particularly the little\\nGenius of Love, the Bacchus and Ampelos, and the spoilt little comely\\nboy supposed to represent -- and quite conceivably -- the infant Nero.\\n\\nCrossing the large Tuscan room again, we come to a little narrow room\\nfilled with what are now called cabinet pictures: far too many to\\nstudy properly, but comprising a benignant old man's head, No. 1167,\\nwhich is sometimes called a Filippino Lippi and sometimes a Masaccio,\\na fragment of a fresco; a boy from the serene perfect hand of Perugino,\\nNo. 1217; two little panels by Fra Bartolommeo -- No. 1161 -- painted for a\\ntabernacle to hold a Donatello relief and representing the Circumcision\\nand Nativity, in colours, and at the back a pretty Annunciation in\\nmonochrome; No. 1235, on the opposite wall, a very sweet Mother and\\nChild by the same artist; a Perseus liberating Andromeda, by Piero\\ndi Cosimo, No. 1312; two or three Lorenzo di Credis; two or three\\nAlloris; a portrait of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, by Antonio Pollaiuolo;\\nand three charming little scenes from the lives of S. John the Baptist\\nand the Virgin, by Fra Angelico, which belong properly to the predella\\nof an altar-piece that we saw in the first room we entered -- No. 1290,\\n\\\"The Coronation of the Virgin\\\". No. 1162 has the gayest green dress\\nin it imaginable.\\n\\nAnd here we enter the Tribuna, which is to the Uffizi what the Salon\\nCarr\\u00e9 is to the Louvre: the special treasure-room of the gallery,\\nholding its most valuable pictures. But to-day there are as good works\\noutside it as in; for the Michelangelo has been moved to another\\nroom, and Botticelli (to name no other) is not represented here at\\nall. Probably the statue famous as the Venus de' Medici would be\\nconsidered the Tribuna's chief possession; but not by me. Nor should\\nI vote either for Titian's Venus. In sculpture I should choose rather\\nthe \\\"Knife-sharpener,\\\" and among the pictures Raphael's \\\"Madonna del\\nCardellino,\\\" No. 1129. But this is not to suggest that everything\\nis not a masterpiece, for it is. Beginning at the door leading from\\nthe room of the little pictures, we find, on our left, Raphael's\\n\\\"Ignota,\\\" No. 1120, so rich and unfeeling, and then Francia's portrait\\nof Evangelista Scappi, so rich and real and a picture that one never\\nforgets. Raphael's Julius II comes next, not so powerful as the version\\nin the Pitti, and above that Titian's famous Venus. In Perugino's\\nportrait of Francesco delle Opere, No. 287, we find an evening sky\\nand landscape still more lovely than Francia's. This Francesco was\\nbrother of Giovanni delle Corniole, a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of Lorenzo de' Medici,\\nfamous as a carver of intaglios, whose portrait of Savonarola in\\nthis medium, now preserved in the Uffizi, in the Gem Room, was said\\nby Michelangelo to carry art to its farthest possible point.\\n\\nA placid and typical Perugino -- the Virgin and two saints -- comes next,\\nand then a northern air sweeps in with Van Dyck's Giovanni di Montfort,\\nnow darkening into gloom but very fine and commanding. Titian's second\\nVenus is above, for which his daughter Lavinia acted as model (the\\nVenus of the other version being possibly the Marchesa della Rovere),\\nand under it is the only Luini in the Uffizi, unmistakably from the\\nsweet hand and full of Leonardesque influence. Beneath this is a rich\\nand decorative work of the Veronese school, a portrait of Elisabetta\\nGonzaga, with another evening sky. Then we go north again, to D\\u00fcrer's\\nAdoration of the Magi, a picture full of pleasant detail -- a little\\nmountain town here, a knight in difficulties with his horse there,\\ntwo butterflies close to the Madonna -- and interesting also for the\\ntreatment of the main theme in D\\u00fcrer's masterly careful way; and then\\nto Spain to Spagnoletto's \\\"S. Jerome\\\" in sombre chiaroscuro; then north\\nagain to a painfully real Christ crowned with thorns, by Lucas van\\nLeyden, and the mousy, Reynoldsy, first wife of Peter Paul Rubens,\\nwhile a Van Dyck portrait under a superb Domenichino and an \\\"Adam\\nand Eve\\\" by Lucas Cranach complete the northern group. And so we come\\nto the two Correggios -- so accomplished and rich and untouching -- all\\ndelightful virtuosity without feeling. The favourite is, of course,\\nNo. 1134, for its adorable Baby, whose natural charm atones for its\\ntheatrical Mother.\\n\\nOn the other side of the door is No. 1129, the perfect \\\"Madonna\\ndel Cardellino\\\" of Raphael, so called from the goldfinch that the\\nlittle boys are caressing. This, one is forced to consider one of the\\nperfect pictures of the world, even though others may communicate more\\npleasure. The landscape is so exquisite and the mild sweetness of the\\nwhole work so complete; and yet, although the technical mastery is\\nalmost thrilling, the \\\"Madonna del Pozzo\\\" by Andrea del Sarto's friend\\nFranciabigio, close by -- No. 1125 -- arouses infinitely livelier feelings\\nin the observer, so much movement and happiness has it. Raphael is\\nperfect but cold; Franciabigio is less perfect (although exceedingly\\naccomplished) but warm with life. The charm of this picture is as\\nnotable as the skill of Raphael's: it is wholly joyous, and the little\\nMadonna really once lived. Both are reproduced in this volume.\\n\\nRaphael's neighbouring youthful \\\"John the Baptist\\\" is almost a\\nGiorgione for richness, but is as truly Raphael as the Sebastian\\ndel Piombo, once (like the Franciabigio also) called a Raphael, is\\nnot. How it came to be considered Raphael, except that there may be\\na faint likeness to the Fornarina, is a mystery.\\n\\nThe rooms next the Tribuna have for some time been under\\nreconstruction, and of these I say little, nor of what pictures are\\nto be placed there. But with the Tribuna, in any case, the collection\\nsuddenly declines, begins to crumble. The first of these rooms, in the\\nspring of this year, 1912, was opened with a number of small Italian\\npaintings; but they are probably only temporarily there. Chief among\\nthem was a Parmigianino, a Boltraffio, a pretty little Guido Reni,\\na Cosimo Tura, a Lorenzo Costa, but nothing really important.\\n\\nIn the tiny Gem Room at the end of the corridor are wonders of\\nthe lapidary's art -- and here is the famous intaglio portrait of\\nSavonarola -- but they want better treatment. The vases and other\\nornaments should have the light all round them, as in the Galerie\\nd'Apollon at the Louvre. These are packed together in wall cases and\\nare hard to see.\\n\\nPassing through the end corridor, where the beautiful Matrona reclines\\nso placidly on her couch against the light, and where we have such\\npleasant views of the Ponte Vecchio, the Trinita bridge, the Arno,\\nand the Apennines, so fresh and real and soothing after so much paint,\\nwe come to the rooms containing the famous collection of self-painted\\nportraits, which, moved hither from Rome, has been accumulating\\nin the Uffizi for many years and is still growing, to be invited\\nto contribute to it being one of the highest honours a painter can\\nreceive. The portraits occupy eight rooms and a passage. Though the\\ncollection is historically and biographically valuable, it contains for\\nevery interesting portrait three or four dull ones, and thus becomes\\nsomething of a weariness. Among the best are Lucas Cranach, Anton More,\\nVan Dyck, Rembrandt (three), Rubens, Seybold, Jordaens, Reynolds,\\nand Romney, all of which remind us of Michelangelo's dry comment,\\n\\\"Every painter draws himself well\\\". Among the most interesting to us,\\nwandering in Florence, are the two Andreas, one youthful and the other\\ngrown fatter than one likes and very different from the melancholy\\nromantic figure in the Pitti; Verrocchio, by Lorenzo di Credi; Carlo\\nDolci, surprising by its good sense and humour; Raphael, angelic,\\nwistful, and weak; Tintoretto, old and powerful; and Jacopo Bassano,\\nold and simple. Among the moderns, Corot's portrait of himself is\\none of the most memorable, but Fantin Latour, Flandrin, Leon Bonnat,\\nand Lenbach are all strong and modest; which one cannot say of our\\nown Leighton. Among the later English heads Orchardson's is notable,\\nbut Mr. Sargent's is disappointing.\\n\\nWe now come to one of the most remarkable rooms in the gallery, where\\nevery picture is a gem; but since all are northern pictures, imported,\\nI give no reproductions. This is the Sala di Van der Goes, so called\\nfrom the great work here, the triptych, painted in 1474 to 1477 by\\nHugo van der Goes, who died in 1482, and was born at Ghent or Leyden\\nabout 1405. This painter, of whose genius there can be no question,\\nis supposed to have been a pupil of the Van Eycks. Not much is known\\nof him save that he painted at Bruges and Ghent and in 1476 entered\\na convent at Brussels where he was allowed to dine with distinguished\\nstrangers who came to see him and where he drank so much wine that his\\nnatural excitability turned to insanity. He seems, however, to have\\nrecovered, and if ever a picture showed few signs of a deranged or\\ninflamed mind it is this, which was painted for the agent of the Medici\\nbank at Bruges, Tommaso Portinari, who presented it to the Hospital of\\nS. Maria Nuova in his native city of Florence, which had been founded\\nby his ancestor Folco, the father of Dante's Beatrice. The left panel\\nshows Tommaso praying with his two sons Antonio and Pigallo, the right\\nhis wife Maria Portinari and their adorably quaint little daughter\\nwith her charming head-dress and costume. The flowers in the centre\\npanel are among the most beautiful things in any Florentine picture:\\nnot wild and wayward like Luca Signorelli's, but most exquisitely\\ndone: irises, red lilies, columbines and dark red clove pinks -- all\\nunexpected and all very unlikely to be in such a wintry landscape at\\nall. On the ground are violets. The whole work is grave, austere,\\ncool, and as different as can be from the Tuscan spirit; yet it is\\nsaid to have had a deep influence on the painters of the time and\\nmust have drawn throngs to the Hospital to see it.\\n\\nThe other Flemish and German pictures in the room are all remarkable\\nand all warmer in tone. No. 906, an unknown work, is perhaps the\\nfinest: a Crucifixion, which might have borrowed its richness from\\nthe Carpaccio, we saw in the Venetian room. There is a fine Adoration\\nof the Magi, by Gerard David (1460-1523); an unknown portrait of\\nPierantonio Baroncelli and his wife, with a lovely landscape; a jewel\\nof paint by Hans Memling (1425-1492) -- No. 703 -- the Madonna Enthroned;\\na masterpiece of drawing by D\\u00fcrer, \\\"Calvary\\\"; an austere and poignant\\nTransportation of Christ to the Sepulchre, by Roger van der Weyden\\n(1400-1464); and several very beautiful portraits by Memling, notably\\nNos. 769 and 780 with their lovely evening light. Memling, indeed,\\nI never liked better than here. Other fine pictures are a Spanish\\nprince by Lucas van Leyden; an old Dutch scholar by an artist unknown,\\nNo. 784; and a young husband and wife by Joost van Cleef the Elder,\\nand a Breughel the Elder, like an old Crome -- a beauty -- No. 928. The\\nroom is interesting both for itself and also as showing how the\\nFlemish brushes were working at the time that so many of the great\\nItalians were engaged on similar themes.\\n\\nAfter the cool, self-contained, scientific work of these northerners\\nit is a change to enter the Sala di Rubens and find that luxuriant\\ngiant -- their compatriot, but how different! -- once more. In the Uffizi,\\nRubens seems more foreign, far, than any one, so fleshly pagan is\\nhe. In Antwerp Cathedral his \\\"Descent from the Cross,\\\" although\\nits bravura is, as always with him, more noticeable than its piety,\\nmight be called a religious picture, but I doubt if even that would\\nseem so here. At any rate his Uffizi works are all secular, while\\nhis \\\"Holy Family\\\" in the Pitti is merely domestic and robust. His\\nFlorentine masterpieces are the two Henri IV pictures in this room,\\n\\\"Henri IV at Ivry,\\\" magnificent if not war, and \\\"Henri's entry into\\nParis after Ivry,\\\" with its confusing muddle of naked warriors and\\nspears. Only Rubens could have painted these spirited, impossible,\\nglorious things, which for all their greatness send one's thoughts\\nback longingly to the portrait of his wife, in the Tribuna, while\\nNo. 216 -- the Bacchanale -- is so coarse as almost to send one's feet\\nthere too.\\n\\nLooking round the room, after Rubens has been dismissed, it is too\\nevident that the best of the Uffizi collection is behind us. There\\nare interesting portraits here, but biographically rather than\\nartistically. Here are one or two fine Sustermans' (1597-1681),\\nthat imported painter whom we shall find in such rare form at the\\nPitti. Here, for example, is Ferdinand II, who did so much for the\\nUffizi and so little for Galileo; and his cousin and wife Vittoria\\ndella Rovere, daughter of Claudia de' Medici (whose portrait, No. 763,\\nis on the easel), and Federigo della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. This\\nsilly, plump lady had been married at the age of fourteen, and she\\nbrought her husband a little money and many pictures from Urbino,\\nnotably those delightful portraits of an earlier Duke and Duchess of\\nUrbino by Piero della Francesca, and also the two Titian \\\"Venuses\\\"\\nin the Tribuna. Ferdinand II and his Grand Duchess were on bad terms\\nfor most of their lives, and she behaved foolishly, and brought up\\nher son Cosimo III foolishly, and altogether was a misfortune to\\nFlorence. Sustermans the painter she held in the highest esteem, and\\nin return he painted her not only as herself but in various unlikely\\ncharacters, among them a Vestal Virgin and even the Madonna.\\n\\nHere also is No. 196, Van Dyck's portrait of Margherita of Lorraine,\\nwhose daughter became Cosimo III's wife -- a mischievous, weak face\\nbut magnificently painted; and No. 1536, a vividly-painted elderly\\nwidow by Jordaens (1593-1678); and on each side of the outrageous\\nRubens a distinguished Dutch gentleman and lady by the placid,\\nrefined Mierevelt.\\n\\nThe two priceless rooms devoted to Iscrizioni come next, but we\\nwill finish the pictures first and therefore pass on to the Sala di\\nBaroccio. Federigo Baroccio (1528-1612) is one of the later painters\\nfor whom I, at any rate, cannot feel any enthusiasm. His position in\\nthe Uffizi is due rather to the circumstance that he was a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of\\nthe Cardinal della Rovere at Rome, whose collection came here, than to\\nhis genius. This room again is of interest rather historically than\\nartistically. Here, for example, are some good Medici portraits by\\nBronzino, among them the famous Eleanora of Toledo, wife of Cosimo I,\\nin a rich brocade (in which she was buried), with the little staring\\nFerdinand I beside her. Eleanora, as we saw in chapter V. was the first\\nmistress of the Pitti palace, and the lady who so disliked Cellini and\\ngot him into such trouble through his lying tongue. Bronzino's little\\nMaria de' Medici -- No. 1164 -- is more pleasing, for the other picture has\\na sinister air. This child, the first-born of Cosimo I and Eleanora,\\ndied when only sixteen. Baroccio has a fine portrait -- Francesco Maria\\nII, last Duke of Urbino, and the grandfather of the Vittoria della\\nRovere whom we saw in the Sala di Rubens. Here also is a portrait\\nof Lorenzo the Magnificent by Vasari, but it is of small value\\nsince Vasari was not born till after Lorenzo's death. The Galileo\\nby Sustermans -- No. 163 -- on the contrary would be from life; and\\nafter the Tribuna portrait of Rubens' first wife it is interesting\\nto find here his pleasant portrait of Helen Fourment, his second. To\\nmy eyes two of the most attractive pictures in the room are the Young\\nSculptor -- No. 1266 -- by Bronzino, and the version of Leonardo's S. Anne\\nat the Louvre by Andrea Salaino of Milan (1483?-1520?). I like also\\nthe hints of tenderness of Bernardino Luini which break through the\\nhardness of the Aurelio Luini picture -- No. 204. For the rest there are\\nsome sickly Guido Renis and Carlo Dolcis and a sentimental Guercino.\\n\\nBut the most popular works -- on Sundays -- are the two Gerard Honthorsts,\\nand not without reason, for they are dramatic and bold and vivid,\\nand there is a Baby in each that goes straight to the maternal\\nheart. No. 157 is perhaps the more satisfying, but I have more reason\\nto remember the larger one -- the Adoration of the Shepherds -- for I\\nwatched a copyist produce a most remarkable replica of it in something\\nunder a week, on the same scale. He was a short, swarthy man with\\na neck like a bull's, and he carried the task off with astonishing\\nbrio, never drawing a line, finishing each part as he came to it, and\\ntalking to a friend or an official the whole time. Somehow one felt him\\nto be precisely the type of copyist that Gherardo della Notte ought\\nto have. This painter was born at Utrecht in 1590 but went early to\\nItaly, and settling in Rome devoted himself to mastering the methods\\nof Amerighi, better known as Caravaggio (1569-1609), who specialized\\nin strong contrasts of light and shade. After learning all he could\\nin Rome, Honthorst returned to Holland and made much money and fame,\\nfor his hand was swift and sure. Charles I engaged him to decorate\\nWhitehall. He died in 1656. These two Honthorsts are, as I say, the\\nmost popular of the pictures on Sunday, when the Uffizi is free; but\\ntheir supremacy is challenged by the five inlaid tables, one of which,\\nchiefly in lapis lazuli, must be the bluest thing on earth.\\n\\nPassing for the present the Sala di Niobe, we come to the Sala di\\nGiovanni di San Giovanni, which is given to a second-rate painter who\\nwas born in 1599 and died in 1636. His best work is a fresco at the\\nBadia of Fiesole. Here he has some theatrical things, including one\\npicture which sends English ladies out blushing. Here also are some\\nLelys, including \\\"Nelly Gwynn\\\". Next are two rooms, one leading from\\nthe other, given to German and Flemish pictures and to miniatures,\\nboth of which are interesting. In the first are more D\\u00fcrers, and\\nthat alone would make it a desirable resort. Here is a \\\"Virgin and\\nChild\\\" -- No. 851 -- very naive and homely, and the beautiful portrait of\\nhis father -- No. 766 -- -a symphony of brown and green. Less attractive\\nworks from the same hand are the \\\"Apostle Philip\\\" -- No. 777 -- and\\n\\\"S. Giacomo Maggiore,\\\" an old man very coarsely painted by comparison\\nwith the artist's father. Here also is a very beautiful portrait\\nof Richard Southwell, by Holbein, with the peacock-green background\\nthat we know so well and always rejoice to see; a typical candle-light\\nSchalcken, No. 800; several golden Poelenburghs; an anonymous portrait\\nof Virgilius von Hytta of Zuicham, No. 784; a clever smiling lady by\\nSustermans, No. 709; the Signora Puliciani and her husband, No. 699;\\na rather crudely coloured Rubens -- \\\"Venus and Adonis\\\" -- No. 812; the\\nsame artist's \\\"Three Graces,\\\" in monochrome, very naked; and some\\nquaint portraits by Lucas Cranach.\\n\\nBut no doubt to many persons the most enchaining picture here is\\nthe Medusa's head, which used to be called a Leonardo and quite\\nsatisfied Ruskin of its genuineness, but is now attributed to the\\nFlemish school. The head, at any rate, would seem to be very similar\\nto that of which Vasari speaks, painted by Leonardo for a peasant,\\nbut retained by his father. Time has dealt hardly with the paint, and\\none has to study minutely before Medusa's horrors are visible. Whether\\nLeonardo's or not, it is not uninteresting to read how the picture\\naffected Shelley when he saw it here in 1819: -- \\n\\n\\n ... Its Horror and its Beauty are divine.\\n Upon its lips and eyelids seem to lie\\n Loveliness like a shadow, from which shine,\\n Fiery and lurid, struggling underneath,\\n The agonies of anguish and of death.\\n\\n\\nThe little room leading from this one should be neglected by no one\\ninterested in Medicean history, for most of the family is here, in\\nminiature, by Bronzino's hand. Here also are miniatures by other great\\npainters, such as Pourbus, Guido Reni, Bassano, Clouet, Holbein. Look\\nparticularly at No. 3382, a woman with brown hair, in purple -- a most\\nfascinating little picture. The Ignota in No. 3348 might easily be\\nHenrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England. The other exhibits\\nare copies in miniature of famous pictures, notable among them a\\nRaphael -- No. 3386 -- and a Breughel -- No. 3445 -- while No. 3341, the\\nrobing of a monk, is worth attention.\\n\\nWe come now to the last pictures of the collection -- in three little\\nrooms at the end, near the bronze sleeping Cupid. Those in the first\\nroom were being rearranged when I was last here; the others contain\\nDutch works notable for a few masterpieces. There are too many\\nPoelenburghs, but the taste shown as a whole is good. Perhaps to\\nthe English enthusiast for painting the fine landscape by Hercules\\nSeghers will, in view of the recent agitation over Lord Lansdowne's\\nRembrandt, \\\"The Mill,\\\" -- ascribed in some quarters to Seghers -- be the\\nmost interesting picture of all. It is a sombre, powerful scene of\\nrugged coast which any artist would have been proud to sign; but it\\nin no way recalls \\\"The Mill's\\\" serene strength. Among the best of\\nits companions are a very good Terburg, a very good Metsu, and an\\nextremely beautiful Ruysdael.\\n\\nAnd so we are at the end of the pictures -- but only to return again and\\nagain -- and are not unwilling to fall into the trap of the official who\\nsits here, and allow him to unlock the door behind the Laoc\\u00f6on group\\nand enjoy what he recommends as a \\\"bella vista\\\" from the open space,\\nwhich turns out to be the roof of the Loggia de' Lanzi. From this\\nhigh point one may see much of Florence and its mountains, while,\\non looking down, over the coping, one finds the busy Piazza della\\nSignoria below, with all its cabs and wayfarers.\\n\\nReturning to the gallery, we come quickly on the right to the first\\nof the neglected statuary rooms, the beautiful Sala di Niobe, which\\ncontains some interesting Medicean and other tapestries, and the\\nsixteen statues of Niobe and her children from the Temple of Apollo,\\nwhich the Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici acquired, and which were for\\nmany years at the Villa Medici at Rome. A suggested reconstruction\\nof the group will be found by the door. I cannot pretend to a deep\\ninterest in the figures, but I like to be in the room. The famous\\nMedicean vase is in the middle of it. Sculpture more ingratiating\\nis close by, in the two rooms given to Iscrizioni: a collection\\nof priceless antiques which are not only beautiful but peculiarly\\ninteresting in that they can be compared with the work of Donatello,\\nVerrocchio, and other of the Renaissance sculptors. For in such a case\\ncomparisons are anything but odious and become fascinating. In the\\nfirst room there is, for example, a Mercury, isolated on the left,\\nin marble, who is a blood relation of Donatello's bronze David in\\nthe Bargello; and certain reliefs of merry children, on the right,\\nlow down, as one approaches the second room, are cousins of the same\\nsculptor's cantoria romps. Not that Donatello ever reproduced the\\nantique spirit as Michelangelo nearly did in his Bacchus, and Sansovino\\nabsolutely did in his Bacchus, both at the Bargello: Donatello was\\nof his time, and the spirit of his time animates his creations, but\\nhe had studied the Greek art in Rome and profited by his lessons,\\nand his evenly-balanced humane mind had a warm corner for pagan\\njoyfulness. Among other statues in this first room is a Sacerdotessa,\\nwearing a marble robe with long folds, whose hands can be seen through\\nthe drapery. Opposite the door are Bacchus and Ampelos, superbly\\npagan, while a sleeping Cupid is most lovely. Among the various fine\\nheads is one of Cicero, of an Unknown -- No. 377 -- and of Homer in bronze\\n(called by the photographers Aristophanes). But each thing in turn is\\nalmost the best. The trouble is that the Uffizi is so vast, and the\\nRenaissance seems to be so eminently the only proper study of mankind\\nwhen one is here, that to attune oneself to the enjoyment of antique\\nsculpture needs a special effort which not all are ready to make.\\n\\nIn the centre of the next room is the punctual Hermaphrodite without\\nwhich no large Continental gallery is complete. But more worthy of\\nattention is the torso of a faun on the left, on a revolving pedestal\\nwhich (unlike those in the Bargello, as we shall discover) really does\\nrevolve and enables you to admire the perfect back. There is also a\\ntorso in basalt or porphyry which one should study from all points,\\nand on the walls some wonderful portions of a frieze from the Ara\\nPacis, erected in Rome, B.C. 139, with wonderful figures of men,\\nwomen, and children on it. Among the heads is a colossal Alexander,\\nvery fine indeed, a beautiful Antoninus, a benign and silly Roman\\nlady in whose existence one can quite believe, and a melancholy\\nSeneca. Look also at Nos. 330 and 332, on the wall: 330, a charming\\ngenius, carrying one of Jove's thunderbolts; and 332, a boy who is\\nsheer Luca della Robbia centuries before his birth.\\n\\nI ought to add that, in addition to the various salons in the Uffizi,\\nthe long corridors are hung with pictures too, in chronological order,\\nthe earliest of all being to the right of the entrance door, and in\\nthe corridors there is also some admirable statuary. But the pictures\\nhere, although not the equals of those in the rooms, receive far too\\nlittle attention, while the sculpture receives even less, whether the\\nbeutiful full-length athletes or the reliefs on the cisterns, several\\nof which have riotous Dionysian processions. On the stairs, too, are\\nsome very beautiful works; while at the top, in the turnstile room, is\\nthe original of the boar which Tacca copied in bronze for the Mercato\\nNuovo, and just outside it are the Medici who were chiefly concerned\\nwith the formation of the collection. On the first landing, nearest\\nthe ground, is a very beautiful and youthful Bacchus. The ceilings\\nof the Uffizi rooms and corridors also are painted, thoughtfully\\nand dexterously, in the Pompeian manner; but there are limits to the\\nreceptive capacity of travellers' eyes, and I must plead guilty to\\nconsistently neglecting them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\\"A\\u00ebrial Fiesole\\\"\\n\\nAndrea del Sarto -- Fiesole sights -- The Villa Palmieri\\nand the \\\"Decameron\\\" -- Botticini's picture in the National\\nGallery -- S. Francesco -- The Roman amphitheatre -- The Etruscan museum -- A\\nsculptor's walk -- The Badia di Fiesole -- Brunelleschi again -- Giovanni\\ndi San Giovanni.\\n\\nAfter all these pictures, how about a little climbing? From so many\\nwindows in Florence, along so many streets, from so many loggias and\\ntowers, and perhaps, above all, from the Piazzale di Michelangelo,\\nFiesole is to be seen on her hill, with the beautiful campanile of\\nher church in the dip between the two eminences, that very soon one\\ncomes to feel that this surely is the promised land. Florence lies\\nso low, and the delectable mountain is so near and so alluring. But\\nI am not sure that to dream of Fiesole as desirable, and to murmur\\nits beautiful syllables, is not best.\\n\\n\\n Let me sit\\nHere by the window with your hand in mine,\\nAnd look a half-hour forth on Fiesole\\n\\n\\n -- that was Andrea's way and not an unwise one. For Fiesole at\\nnearer view can easily disappoint. It is beautifully set on its\\nhill and it has a fascinating past; but the journey thither on\\nfoot is very wearisome, by the electric tram vexatious and noisy,\\nand in a horse-drawn carriage expensive and cruel; and when you\\nare there you become once more a tourist without alleviation and\\nare pestered by beggars, and by nice little girls who ought to\\nknow better, whose peculiar importunacy it is to thrust flowers\\ninto the hand or buttonhole without any denial. What should have\\nbeen a mountain retreat from the city has become a kind of Devil's\\nDyke. But if one is resolute, and, defying all, walks up to the\\nlittle monastery of S. Francesco at the very top of the hill, one\\nmay rest almost undisturbed, with Florence in the valley below, and\\ngardens and vineyards undulating beneath, and a monk or two ascending\\nor descending the steps, and three or four picture-postcard hawkers\\ngambling in a corner, and lizards on the wall. Here it is good to be\\nin the late afternoon, when the light is mellowing; and if you want\\ntea there is a little loggia a few yards down this narrow steep path\\nwhere it may be found. How many beautiful villas in which one could\\nbe happy sunning oneself among the lizards lie between this point\\nand Florence! Who, sitting here, can fail to think that?\\n\\nIn walking to Fiesole one follows the high walls of the Villa Palmieri,\\nwhich is now very private American property, but is famous for ever as\\nthe first refuge of Boccaccio's seven young women and three young men\\nwhen they fled from plague-stricken Florence in 1348 and told tales for\\nten halcyon days. It is now generally agreed that if Boccaccio had any\\nparticular house in his mind it was this. It used to be thought that\\nthe Villa Poggio Gherardo, Mrs. Ross's beautiful home on the way to\\nSettignano, was the first refuge, and the Villa Palmieri the second,\\nbut the latest researches have it that the Palmieri was the first and\\nthe Podere della Fonte, or Villa di Boccaccio, as it is called, near\\nCamerata, a little village below S. Domenico, the other. The Villa\\nPalmieri has another and somewhat different historical association,\\nfor it was there that Queen Victoria resided for a while in 1888. But\\nthe most interesting thing of all about it is the circumstance that\\nit was the home of Matteo Palmieri, the poet, and Botticelli's friend\\nand fellow-speculator on the riddle of life. Palmieri was the author\\nof a remarkable poem called \\\"La Citta della Vita\\\" (The City of Life)\\nwhich developed a scheme of theology that had many attractions to\\nBotticelli's curious mind. The poem was banned by Rome, although\\nnot until after its author's death. In our National Gallery is a\\npicture which used to be considered Botticelli's -- No. 1126, \\\"The\\nAssumption of the Virgin\\\" -- especially as it is mentioned with some\\nparticularity by Vasari, together with the circumstance that the\\npoet and painter devised it in collaboration, in which the poem is\\ntranslated into pigment. As to the theology, I say nothing, nor as to\\nits new ascription to Botticini; but the picture has a greater interest\\nfor us in that it contains a view of Florence with its wall of towers\\naround it in about 1475. The exact spot where the painter sat has been\\nidentified by Miss Stokes in \\\"Six Months in the Apennines\\\". On the\\nleft immediately below the painter's vantage-ground is the Mugnone,\\nwith a bridge over it. On the bank in front is the Villa Palmieri,\\nand on the picture's extreme left is the Badia of Fiesole.\\n\\nOn leaving S. Domenico, if still bent on walking, one should keep\\nstraight on and not follow the tram lines to the right. This is the\\nold and terribly steep road which Lorenzo the Magnificent and his\\nfriends Politian and Pico della Mirandola had to travel whenever they\\nvisited the Medici villa, just under Fiesole, with its drive lined with\\ncypresses. Here must have been great talk and much conviviality. It\\nis now called the Villa McCalmont.\\n\\nOnce at Fiesole, by whatever means you reach it, do not neglect to\\nclimb the monastery steps to the very top. It is a day of climbing,\\nand a hundred or more steps either way mean nothing now. For here\\nis a gentle little church with swift, silent monks in it, and a few\\nflowers in bowls, and a religious picture by that strange Piero di\\nCosimo whose heart was with the gods in exile; and the view of Monte\\nCeceri, on the other side of Fiesole, seen through the cypresses here,\\nwhich could not be better in disposition had Benozzo Gozzoli himself\\narranged them, is very striking and memorable.\\n\\nFiesole's darling son is Mino the sculptor -- the \\\"Raphael of the\\nchisel\\\" -- whose radiant Madonnas and children and delicate tombs may\\nbe seen here and there all over Florence. The piazza is named after\\nhim; he is celebrated on a marble slab outside the museum, where all\\nthe famous names of the vicinity may be read too; and in the church\\nis one of his most charming groups and finest heads. They are in a\\nlittle chapel on the right of the choir. The head is that of Bishop\\nSalutati, humorous, wise, and benign, and the group represents the\\nadoration of a merry little Christ by a merry little S. John and\\nothers. As for the church itself, it is severe and cool, with such\\nstone columns in it as must last for ever.\\n\\nBut the main interest of Fiesole to most people is not the\\ncypress-covered hill of S. Francesco; not the view from the summit;\\nnot the straw mementoes; not the Mino relief in the church; but\\nthe Roman arena. The excavators have made of this a very complete\\nplace. One can stand at the top of the steps and reconstruct it\\nall -- the audience, the performance, the performers. A very little time\\nspent on building would be needed to restore the amphitheatre to its\\noriginal form. Beyond it are baths, and in a hollow the remains of a\\ntemple with the altar where it ever was; and then one walks a little\\nfarther and is on the ancient Etruscan wall, built when Fiesole was an\\nEtruscan fortified hill city. So do the centuries fall away here! But\\neverywhere, among the ancient Roman stones so massive and exact,\\nand the Etruscan stones, are the wild flowers which Luca Signorelli\\npainted in that picture in the Uffizi which I love so much.\\n\\nAfter the amphitheatre one visits the Museum -- with the same ticket -- a\\nlittle building filled with trophies of the spade. There is nothing\\nvery wonderful -- nothing to compare with the treasures of the\\nArchaeological Museum in Florence -- but it is well worth a visit.\\n\\nOn leaving the Museum on the last occasion that I was there -- in\\nApril -- I walked to Settignano. The road for a while is between\\nhouses, for Fiesole stretches a long way farther than one suspects,\\nvery high, looking over the valley of the Mugnone; and then after a\\nperiod between pine trees and grape-hyacinths one turns to the right\\nand begins to descend. Until Poggio del Castello, a noble villa,\\non an isolated eminence, the descent is very gradual, with views of\\nFlorence round the shoulder of Monte Ceceri; but afterwards the road\\nwinds, to ease the fall, and the wayfarer turns off into the woods and\\ntumbles down the hill by a dry water-course, amid crags and stones,\\nto the beginnings of civilization again, at the Via di Desiderio da\\nSettignano, a sculptor who stands to his native town in precisely\\nthe same relation as Mino to his.\\n\\nSettignano is a mere village, with villas all about it, and\\nthe thing to remember there is not only that Desiderio was born\\nthere but that Michelangelo's foster-mother was the wife of a\\nlocal stone-cutter -- stone-cutting at that time being the staple\\nindustry. On the way back to Florence in the tram, one passes on the\\nright a gateway surmounted by statues of the poets, the Villa Poggio\\nGherardo, of which I have spoken earlier in the chapter. There is no\\nvilla with a nobler mien than this.\\n\\nThat is one walk from Fiesole. Another is even more a sculptors' way:\\nfor it would include Maiano too, where Benedetto was born. The road\\nis by way of the tram lines to that acute angle just below Fiesole\\nwhen they turn back to S. Domenico, and so straight on down the hill.\\n\\nBut if one is returning to Florence direct after leaving Fiesole it\\nis well to walk down the precipitous paths to S. Domenico, and before\\nagain taking the tram visit the Badia overlooking the valley of the\\nMugnone. This is done by turning to the right just opposite the church\\nof S. Domenico, which has little interest structurally but is famous\\nas being the chapel of the monastery where Fra Angelico was once a\\nmonk. The Badia (Abbey) di Fiesole, as it now is, was built on the\\nsite of an older monastery, by Cosimo Pater. Here Marsilio Ficino's\\nPlatonic Academy used to meet, in the loggia and in the little temple\\nwhich one gains from the cloisters, and here Pico della Mirandola\\ncomposed his curious gloss on Genesis.\\n\\nThe dilapidated marble fa\\u00e7ade of the church and its rugged stone-work\\nare exceedingly ancient -- dating in fact from the eleventh century;\\nthe new building is by Brunelleschi and to my mind is one of his\\nmost beautiful works, its lovely proportions and cool, unfretted\\nwhite spaces communicating even more pleasure than the Pazzi chapel\\nitself. The decoration has been kept simple and severe, and the colour\\nis just the grey pietra serena of Fiesole, of which the lovely arches\\nare made, all most exquisitely chiselled, and the pure white of the\\nwalls and ceilings. This church was a favourite with the Medici, and\\nthe youthful Giovanni, the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, received\\nhis cardinal's hat here in 1492, at the age of sixteen. He afterwards\\nbecame Pope Leo X. How many of the boys, now in the school -- for the\\nmonastery has become a Jesuit school -- will, one wonders, rise to\\nsimilar eminence.\\n\\nIn the beautiful cloisters we have the same colour scheme as\\nin the church, and here again Brunelleschi's miraculous genius\\nfor proportion is to be found. Here and there are foliations and\\nother exquisite tracery by pupils of Desiderio da Settignano. The\\nrefectory has a high-spirited fresco by that artist whose room in\\nthe Uffizi is so carefully avoided by discreet chaperons -- Giovanni di\\nSan Giovanni -- representing Christ eating at a table, his ministrants\\nbeing a crowd of little roguish angels and cherubim, one of whom (on\\nthe right) is in despair at having broken a plate. In the entrance\\nlobby is a lavabo by Mino da Fiesole, with two little boys of the\\nwhitest and softest marble on it, which is worth study.\\n\\nAnd now we will return to the heart of Florence once more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nThe Badia and Dante\\n\\nFilippino Lippi -- Buffalmacco -- Mino da Fiesole -- The Dante quarter -- Dante\\nand Beatrice -- Monna Tessa -- Gemma Donati -- Dante in exile -- Dante\\nmemorials in Florence -- The Torre della Castagna -- The Borgo degli\\nAlbizzi and the old palaces -- S. Ambrogio -- Mino's tabernacle -- Wayside\\nmasterpieces -- S. Egidio.\\n\\nOpposite the Bargello is a church with a very beautiful doorway\\ndesigned by Benedetto da Rovezzano. This church is known as the Badia,\\nand its delicate spire is a joy in the landscape from every point of\\nvantage. The Badia is very ancient, but the restorers have been busy\\nand little of Arnolfo's thirteenth-century work is left. It is chiefly\\nfamous now for its Filippino Lippi and two tombs by Mino da Fiesole,\\nbut historically it is interesting as being the burial-place of the\\nchief Florentine families in the Middle Ages and as being the scene\\nof Boccaccio's lectures on Dante in 1373. The Filippino altar-piece,\\nwhich represents S. Bernard's Vision of the Virgin (a subject we shall\\nsee treated very beautifully by Fra Bartolommeo at the Accademia)\\nis one of the most perfect and charming pictures by this artist:\\nvery grave and real and sweet, and the saint's hands exquisitely\\npainted. The figure praying in the right-hand corner is the patron,\\nPiero di Francesco del Pugliese, who commissioned this picture for the\\nchurch of La Campora, outside the Porta Romana, where it was honoured\\nuntil 1529, when Clement VII's troops advancing, it was brought here\\nfor safety and has here remained.\\n\\nClose by -- in the same chapel -- is a little door which the sacristan\\nwill open, disclosing a portion of Arnolfo's building with perishing\\nfrescoes which are attributed to Buffalmacco, an artist as to whose\\nreality much scepticism prevails. They are not in themselves of much\\ninterest, although the sacristan's eagerness should not be discouraged;\\nbut Buffalmacco being Boccaccio's, Sacchetti's, Vasari's (and, later,\\nAnatole France's) amusing hero, it is pleasant to look at his work and\\nthink of his freakishness. Buffalmacco (if he ever existed) was one\\nof the earlier painters, flourishing between 1311 and 1350, and was\\na pupil of Andrea Tafi. This simple man he plagued very divertingly,\\nonce frightening him clean out of his house by fixing little lighted\\ncandles to the backs of beetles and steering them into Tafi's bedroom\\nat night. Tafi was terrified, but on being told by Buffalmacco (who was\\na lazy rascal) that these devils were merely showing their objection\\nto early rising, he became calm again, and agreed to lie in bed to\\na reasonable hour. Cupidity, however, conquering, he again ordered\\nhis pupil to be up betimes, when the beetles again re-appeared and\\ncontinued to do so until the order was revoked.\\n\\nThe sculptor Mino da Fiesole, whom we shall shortly see again, at the\\nBargello, in portrait busts and Madonna reliefs, is at his best here,\\nin the superb monument to Count Ugo, who founded, with his mother,\\nthe Benedictine Abbey of which the Badia is the relic. Here all Mino's\\nsweet thoughts, gaiety and charm are apparent, together with the\\nperfection of radiant workmanship. The quiet dignity of the recumbent\\nfigure is no less masterly than the group above it. Note the impulsive\\nurgency of the splendid Charity, with her two babies, and the quiet\\nbeauty of the Madonna and Child above all, while the proportions and\\ndelicate patterns of the tomb as a whole still remain to excite one's\\npleasure and admiration. We shall see many tombs in Florence -- few not\\nbeautiful -- but none more joyously accomplished than this. The tomb\\nof Carlo Marsuppini in S. Croce by Desiderio da Settignano, which\\nawaits us, was undoubtedly the parent of the Ugo, Mino following his\\nmaster very closely; but his charm was his own. According to Vasari,\\nthe Ugo tomb was considered to be Mino's finest achievement, and he\\ndeliberately made the Madonna and Child as like the types of his\\nbeloved Desiderio as he could. It was finished in 1481, and Mino\\ndied in 1484, from a chill following over-exertion in moving heavy\\nstones. Mino also has here a monument to Bernardo Giugni, a famous\\ngonfalonier in the time of Cosimo de' Medici, marked by the same\\ndistinction, but not quite so memorable. The Ugo is his masterpiece.\\n\\nThe carved wooden ceiling, which is a very wonderful piece of work\\nand of the deepest and most glorious hue, should not be forgotten;\\nbut nothing is easier than to overlook ceilings.\\n\\nThe cloisters are small, but they atone for that -- if it is a fault -- by\\nhaving a loggia. From the loggia the top of the noble tower of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio is seen to perfection. Upon the upper walls is a\\nseries of frescoes illustrating the life of S. Benedict which must\\nhave been very gay and spirited once but are now faded.\\n\\nThe Badia may be said to be the heart of the Dante quarter. Dante must\\noften have been in the church before it was restored as we now see it,\\nand a quotation from the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\" is on its fa\\u00e7ade. The Via\\nDante and the Piazza Donati are close by, and in the Via Dante are many\\nreminders of the poet besides his alleged birthplace. Elsewhere in the\\ncity we find incised quotations from his poem; but the Baptistery -- his\\n\\\"beautiful San Giovanni\\\" -- is the only building in the city proper now\\nremaining which Dante would feel at home in could he return to it, and\\nwhere we can feel assured of sharing his presence. The same pavement is\\nthere on which his feet once stood, and on the same mosaic of Christ\\nabove the altar would his eyes have fallen. When Dante was exiled in\\n1302 the cathedral had been in progress only for six or eight years;\\nbut it is known that he took the deepest interest in its construction,\\nand we have seen the stone marking the place where he sat, watching\\nthe builders. The fa\\u00e7ade of the Badia of Fiesole and the church of\\nS. Miniato can also remember Dante; no others.\\n\\nHere, however, we are on that ground which is richest in personal\\nassociations with him and his, for in spite of re-building and\\ncertain modern changes the air is heavy with antiquity in these\\nnarrow streets and passages where the poet had his childhood and\\nyouth. The son of a lawyer named Alighieri, Dante was born in\\n1265, but whether or not in this Casa Dante is an open question,\\nand it was in the Baptistery that he received the name of Durante,\\nafterwards abbreviated to Dante -- Durante meaning enduring, and Dante\\ngiving. Those who have read the \\\"Vita Nuova,\\\" either in the original\\nor in Rossetti's translation, may be surprised to learn that the\\nboy was only nine when he first met his Beatrice, who was seven,\\nand for ever passed into bondage to her. Who Beatrice was is again\\na mystery, but it has been agreed to consider her in real life a\\ndaughter of Folco Portinari, a wealthy Florentine and the founder of\\nthe hospital of S. Maria Nuova, one of whose descendants commissioned\\nHugo van der Goes to paint the great triptych in the Uffizi. Folco's\\ntomb is in S. Egidio, the hospital church, while in the passage to\\nthe cloisters is a stone figure of Monna Tessa (of whom we are about\\nto see a coloured bust in the Bargello), who was not only Beatrice's\\nnurse (if Beatrice were truly of the Portinari) but the instigator,\\nit is said, of Folco's deed of charity.\\n\\nOf Dante's rapt adoration of his lady, the \\\"Vita Nuova\\\"\\ntells. According to that strangest monument of devotion it was not\\nuntil another nine years had passed that he had speech of her; and\\nthen Beatrice, meeting him in the street, saluted him as she passed\\nhim with such ineffable courtesy and grace that he was lifted into a\\nseventh heaven of devotion and set upon the writing of his book. The\\ntwo seem to have had no closer intercourse: Beatrice shone distantly\\nlike a star and her lover worshipped her with increasing loyalty\\nand fervour, overlaying the idea of her, as one might say, with gold\\nand radiance, very much as we shall see Fra Angelico adding glory to\\nthe Madonna and Saints in his pictures, and with a similar intensity\\nof ecstasy. Then one day Beatrice married, and not long afterwards,\\nbeing always very fragile, she died, at the age of twenty-three. The\\nfact that she was no longer on earth hardly affected her poet,\\nwhose worship of her had always so little of a physical character;\\nand she continued to dominate his thoughts.\\n\\nIn 1293, however, Dante married, one Gemma Donati of the powerful\\nGuelph family of that name, of which Corso Donati was the turbulent\\nhead; and by her he had many children. For Gemma, however, he seems\\nto have had no affection; and when in 1301 he left Florence, never to\\nreturn, he left his wife for ever too. In 1289 Dante had been present\\nat the battle of Campaldino, fighting with the Guelphs against the\\nGhibellines, and on settling down in Florence and taking to politics it\\nwas as a Guelph, or rather as one of that branch of the Guelph party\\nwhich had become White -- the Bianchi -- as opposed to the other party\\nwhich was Black -- the Neri. The feuds between these divisions took the\\nplace of those between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, since Florence\\nwas never happy without internal strife, and it cannot have added\\nto Dante's home comfort that his wife was related to Corso Donati,\\nwho led the Neri and swaggered in his bullying way about the city with\\nproprietary, intolerant airs that must have been infuriating to a man\\nwith Dante's stern sense of right and justice. It was Corso who brought\\nabout Dante's exile; but he himself survived only six years, and was\\nthen killed, by his own wish, on his way to execution, rather than be\\nhumiliated in the city in which he had swayed. Dante, whose genius\\ndevised a more lasting form of reprisal than any personal encounter\\ncould be, has depicted him in the \\\"Purgatorio\\\" as on the road to Hell.\\n\\nBut this is going too fast. In 1300, when Dante was thirty-five,\\nhe was sufficiently important to be made one of the six priors of\\nthe city, and in that capacity was called upon to quell a Neri and\\nBianchi disturbance. It is characteristic of him that he was a party\\nto the banishment of the leaders of both factions, among whom was\\nhis closest friend, Guido Cavalcanti the poet, who was one of the\\nBianchi. Whether it was because of Guide's illness in his exile, or\\nfrom what motive, we shall not know; but the sentence was lightened in\\nthe case of this Bianco, a circumstance which did not add to Dante's\\nchances when the Neri, having plotted successfully with Charles of\\nValois, captured supreme power in Florence. This was in the year 1301,\\nDante being absent from that city on an embassy to Rome to obtain help\\nfor the Bianchi. He never came back; for the Neri plans succeeded;\\nthe Neri assumed control; and in January, 1302, he was formally fined\\nand banished. The nominal charge against him was of misappropriating\\nfunds while a prior; but that was merely a matter of form. His real\\noffence was in being one of the Bianchi, an enemy of the Neri, and\\na man of parts.\\n\\nIn the rest of Dante's life Florence had no part, except in his\\nthoughts. How he viewed her the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\" tells us, and that he\\nlonged to return we also know. The chance was indeed once offered,\\nbut under the impossible condition that he should do public penance\\nin the Baptistery for his offence. This he refused. He wandered here\\nand there, and settled finally in Ravenna, where he died in 1321. The\\n\\\"Divine Comedy\\\" anticipating printing by so many years -- the invention\\ndid not reach Florence until 1471 -- Dante could not make much popular\\nway as a poet before that time; but to his genius certain Florentines\\nwere earlier no strangers, not only by perusing MS. copies of his\\ngreat work, which by its richness in Florentine allusions excited\\nan interest apart altogether from that created by its beauty, but by\\npublic lectures on the poem, delivered in the churches by order of\\nthe Signoria. The first Dante professor to be appointed was Giovanni\\nBoccaccio, the author of the \\\"Decameron,\\\" who was born in 1313,\\neight years before Dante's death, and became an enthusiast upon the\\npoet. The picture in the Duomo was placed there in 1465. Then came\\nprinting to Florence and Dante passed quickly into his countrymen's\\nthoughts and language.\\n\\nMichelangelo, who was born in time -- 1475 -- to enjoy in Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent's house the new and precious advantage of printed books,\\nbecame as a boy a profound student of the poet, and when later an\\nappeal was made from Florence to the Pope to sanction the removal of\\nDante's bones to Florence, Michelangelo was among the signatories. But\\nit was not done. His death-mask from Ravenna is in the Bargello:\\na few of his bones and their coffin are still in Ravenna, in the\\nmonastery of Classe, piously preserved in a room filled with Dante\\nrelics and literature; his tomb is elsewhere at Ravenna, a shrine\\nvisited by thousands every year.\\n\\nEver since has Dante's fame been growing, so that only the Bible has\\nled to more literature; and to-day Florence is more proud of him than\\nany of her sons, except perhaps Michelangelo. We have seen one or\\ntwo reminders of him already; more are here where we stand. We have\\nseen the picture in honour of him which the Republic set up in the\\ncathedral; his head on a beautiful inlaid door in the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nthe building where his sentence of banishment was devised and carried,\\nto be followed by death sentence thrice repeated (burning alive,\\nto be exact); and we have seen the head-quarters of the Florentine\\nDante society in the guild house at Or San Michele. We have still\\nto see his statue opposite S. Croce, another fresco head in S. Maria\\nNovella, certain holograph relics at the library at S. Lorenzo, and\\nhis head again by his friend Giotto, in the Bargello, where he would\\nhave been confined while waiting for death had he been captured.\\n\\nDante's house has been rebuilt, very recently, and next to it is a\\nnewer building still, with a long inscription in Italian upon it,\\nto the effect that the residence of Bella and Bellincione Alighieri\\nstood hereabouts, and in that abode was Dante born. The Commune of\\nFlorence, it goes on to say, having secured possession of the site,\\n\\\"built this edifice on the remains of the ancestral house as fresh\\nevidence of the public veneration of the divine poet\\\". The Torre della\\nCastagna, across the way, has an inscription in Italian, which may be\\ntranslated thus: \\\"This Tower, the so-called Tower of the Chestnut, is\\nthe solitary remnant of the head-quarters from which the Priors of the\\nArts governed Florence, before the power and glory of the Florentine\\nCommune procured the erection of the Palace of the Signoria\\\".\\n\\nFew persons in the real city of Florence, it may be said confidently,\\nlive in a house built for them; but hereabouts none at all. In fact,\\nit is the exception anywhere near the centre of the city to live in\\na house built less than three centuries ago. Palaces abound, cut up\\ninto offices, flats, rooms, and even cinema theatres. The telegraph\\noffice in the Via del Proconsolo is a palace commissioned by the\\nStrozzi but never completed: hence its name, Nonfinito; next it is\\nthe superb Palazzo Quaratesi, which Brunelleschi designed, now the\\nhead-quarters of a score of firms and an Ecclesiastical School whence\\nsounds of sacred song continually emerge.\\n\\nSince we have Mino da Fiesole in our minds and are on the subject\\nof old palaces let us walk from the Dante quarter in a straight line\\nfrom the Corso, that very busy street of small shops, across the Via\\ndel Proconsolo and down the Borgo degli Albizzi to S. Ambrogio, where\\nMino was buried. This Borgo is a street of palaces and an excellent one\\nin which to reflect upon the strange habit which wealthy Florentines\\nthen indulged of setting their mansions within a few feet of those\\nopposite. Houses -- or rather fortresses -- that must have cost fortunes\\nand have been occupied by families of wealth and splendour were\\nerected so close to their vis-\\u00e0-vis that two carts could not pass\\nabreast between them. Side by side contiguity one can understand,\\nbut not this other adjacence. Every ground floor window is barred\\nlike a gaol. Those bars tell us something of the perils of life in\\nFlorence in the great days of faction ambition; while the thickness\\nof the walls and solidity of construction tell us something too of\\nthe integrity of the Florentine builders. These ancient palaces,\\none feels, whatever may happen to them, can never fall to ruin. Such\\nstones as are placed one upon the other in the Pitti and the Strozzi\\nand the Riccardi nothing can displace. It is an odd thought that\\nseveral Florentine palaces and villas built before Columbus sailed\\nfor America are now occupied by rich Americans, some of them draw\\npossibly much of their income from the manufacture of steel girders\\nfor sky-scrapers. These ancient streets with their stern and sombre\\npalaces specially touched the imagination of Dickens when he was in\\nFlorence in 1844, but in his \\\"Pictures from Italy\\\" he gave the city\\nonly fugitive mention. The old prison, which then adjoined the Palazzo\\nVecchio, and in which the prisoners could be seen, also moved him.\\n\\nThe Borgo degli Albizzi, as I have said, is crowded with\\nPalazzi. No. 24 -- and there is something very incongruous in palaces\\nhaving numbers at all -- is memorable in history as being one of the\\nhomes of the Pazzi family who organized the conspiracy against the\\nMedici in 1478, as I have related in the second chapter, and failed\\nso completely. Donatello designed the coat of arms here. The palace\\nat No. 18 belonged to the Altoviti. No. 12 is the Palazzo Albizzi,\\nthe residence of one of the most powerful of the Florentine families,\\nwhose allies were all about them in this quarter, as it was wise to be.\\n\\nAs a change from picture galleries, I can think of nothing more\\ndelightful than to wander about these ancient streets, and, wherever a\\ncourtyard or garden shines, penetrate to it; stopping now and again to\\nenjoy the vista, the red Duomo, or Giotto's tower, so often mounting\\ninto the sky at one end, or an indigo Apennine at the other. Standing\\nin the middle of the Via Ricasoli, for example, one has sight of both.\\n\\nAt the Piazza S. Pietro we see one of the old towers of Florence,\\nof which there were once so many, into which the women and children\\nmight retreat in times of great danger, and here too is a series of\\narches which fruit and vegetable shops make gay.\\n\\nThe next Piazza is that of S. Ambrogio. This church is interesting\\nnot only for doing its work in a poor quarter -- one has the feeling at\\nonce that it is a right church in the right place -- but as containing,\\nas I have said, the grave of Mino da Fiesole: Mino de' Poppi detto da\\nFiesole, as the floor tablet has it. Over the altar of Mino's little\\nchapel is a large tabernacle from his hand, in which the gayest little\\nBoy gives the benediction, own brother to that one by Desiderio at\\nS. Lorenzo. The tabernacle must be one of the master's finest works,\\nand beneath it is a relief in which a priest pours something -- perhaps\\nthe very blood of Christ which is kept here -- from one chalice to\\nanother held by a kneeling woman, surrounded by other kneeling women,\\nwhich is a marvel of flowing beauty and life. The lines of it are\\npeculiarly lovely.\\n\\nOn the wall of the same little chapel is a fresco by Cosimo Rosselli\\nwhich must once have been a delight, representing a procession of\\nCorpus Christi -- this chapel being dedicated to the miracle of the\\nSacrament -- and it contains, according to Vasari, a speaking likeness of\\nPico della Mirandola. Other graves in the church are those of Cronaca,\\nthe architect of the Palazzo Vecchio's great Council Room, a friend\\nof Savonarola and Rosselli's nephew by marriage; and Verrocchio, the\\nsculptor, whose beautiful work we are now to see in the Bargello. It\\nis said that Lorenzo di Credi also lies here, and Albertinelli,\\nwho gave up the brush for innkeeping.\\n\\nOpposite the church, on a house at the corner of the Borgo S. Croce\\nand the Via de' Macci, is a della Robbia saint -- one of many such\\nmural works of art in Florence. Thus, at the corner of the Via Cavour\\nand the Via de' Pucci, opposite the Riccardi palace, is a beautiful\\nMadonna and Child by Donatello. In the Via Zannetti, which leads\\nout of the Via Cerretani, is a very pretty example by Mino, a few\\nhouses on the right. These are sculpture. And everywhere in the older\\nstreets you may see shrines built into the wall: there is even one in\\nthe prison, in the Via dell' Agnolo, once the convent of the Murate,\\nwhere Catherine de' Medici was imprisoned as a girl; but many of them\\nare covered with glass which has been allowed to become black.\\n\\nA word or two on S. Egidio, the church of the great hospital of\\nS. Maria Nuova, might round off this chapter, since it was Folco\\nPortinari, Beatrice's father, who founded it. The hospital stands\\nin a rather forlorn square a few steps from the Duomo, down the Via\\ndell' Orivolo and then the first to the left; and it extends right\\nthrough to the Via degli Alfani in cloisters and ramifications. The\\nfa\\u00e7ade is in a state of decay, old frescoes peeling off it, but one\\npicture has been enclosed for protection -- a gay and busy scene of the\\nconsecration of the church by Pope Martin V. Within, it is a church\\nof the poor, notable for its general florid comfort (comparatively)\\nand Folco's gothic tomb. In the chancel is a pretty little tabernacle\\nby Mino, which used to have a bronze door by Ghiberti, but has it no\\nlonger, and a very fine della Robbia Madonna and Child, probably by\\nAndrea. Behind a grille, upstairs, sit the hospital nurses. In the\\nadjoining cloisters -- one of the high roads to the hospital proper -- is\\nthe ancient statue of old Monna Tessa, Beatrice's nurse, and, in a\\nniche, a pretty symbolical painting of Charity by that curious painter\\nGiovanni di San Giovanni. It was in the hospital that the famous Van\\nder Goes triptych used to hang.\\n\\nA tablet on a house opposite S. Egidio, a little to the right,\\nstates that it was there that Ghiberti made the Baptistery gates\\nwhich Michelangelo considered fit to be the portals of Paradise.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nThe Bargello\\n\\nPlastic art -- Blood-soaked stones -- The faithful\\nartists -- Michelangelo -- Italian custodians -- The famous\\nDavids -- Michelangelo's tondo -- Brutus -- Benedetto da\\nRovezzano -- Donatello's life-work -- The S. George -- Verrocchio -- Ghiberti\\nand Brunelleschi and the Baptistery doors -- Benvenuto Cellini -- John of\\nBologna -- Antonio Pollaiuolo -- Verrocchio again -- Mino da Fiesole -- The\\nFlorentine wealth of sculpture -- Beautiful ladies -- The della\\nRobbias -- South Kensington and the Louvre.\\n\\nBefore my last visit but one to Florence, plastic art was less\\nattractive to me than pictorial art. But now I am not sure. At\\nany rate when, here in England, I think of Florence, as so often\\nI do, I find myself visiting in imagination the Bargello before the\\nUffizi. Pictures in any number can bewilder and dazzle as much as they\\ndelight. The eye tires. And so, it is true, can a multiplicity of\\nantique statuary such as one finds at the Vatican or at the Louvre;\\nbut a small collection of Renaissance work, so soft and human,\\nas at the Bargello, is not only joy-giving but refreshing too. The\\nsoft contours soothe as well as enrapture the eye: the tenderness of\\nthe Madonnas, the gentleness of the Florentine ladies and youths, as\\nVerrocchio and Mino da Fiesole, Donatello, and Pollaiuolo moulded them,\\ncalm one where the perfection of Phidias and Praxiteles excites. Hence\\nthe very special charm of the Bargello, whose plastic treasures are\\ncomparatively few and picked, as against the heaped profusion of paint\\nin the Uffizi and the Pitti. It pairs off rather with the Accademia,\\nand has this further point in common with that choicest of galleries,\\nthat Michelangelo's chisel is represented in both.\\n\\nThe Bargello is at the corner of the Via Ghibellina in the narrow\\nVia del Proconsolo -- so narrow that if you take one step off the\\npavement a tram may easily sweep you into eternity; so narrow also\\nthat the real dignity of the Bargello is never to be properly seen,\\nand one thinks of it rather for its inner court and staircase and\\nits strong tower than for its massive fa\\u00e7ades. Its history is soaked\\nin blood. It was built in the middle of the thirteenth century as the\\nresidence of the chief magistrate of the city, the Capitano del popolo,\\nor Podest\\u00e0, first appointed soon after the return of the Guelphs in\\n1251, and it so remained, with such natural Florentine vicissitudes\\nas destruction by mobs and fire, for four hundred years, when, in\\n1574, it was converted into a prison and place of execution and the\\nhead-quarters of the police, and changed its name from the Palazzo\\ndel Podest\\u00e0 to that by which it is now known, so called after the\\nBargello, or chief of the police.\\n\\nIt is indeed fortunate that no rioters succeeded in obliterating\\nGiotto's fresco in the Bargello chapel, which he painted probably in\\n1300, when his friend Dante was a Prior of the city. Giotto introduced\\nthe portrait of Dante which has drawn so many people to this little\\nroom, together with portraits of Corso Donati, and Brunetto Latini,\\nDante's tutor. Whitewash covered it for two centuries. Dante's head\\nhas been restored.\\n\\nIt was in 1857 that the Bargello was again converted, this time to its\\npresent gracious office of preserving the very flower of Renaissance\\nplastic art.\\n\\nPassing through the entrance hall, which has a remarkable collection of\\nMedicean armour and weapons, and in which (I have read but not seen)\\nis an oubliette under one of the great pillars, the famous court is\\ngained and the famous staircase. Of this court what can I say? Its\\nquality is not to be communicated in words; and even the photographs of\\nit that are sold have to be made from pictures, which the assiduous\\nSignor Giuliani, among others, is always so faithfully painting,\\nstone for stone. One forgets all the horrors that once were enacted\\nhere -- the execution of honourable Florentine patriots whose only\\noffence was that in their service of this proud and beautiful city they\\ndiffered from those in power; one thinks only of the soft light on the\\nimmemorial walls, the sturdy graceful columns, the carved escutcheons,\\nthe resolute steps, the spaciousness and stern calm of it all.\\n\\nIn the colonnade are a number of statues, the most famous of which\\nis perhaps the \\\"Dying Adonis\\\" which Baedeker gives to Michelangelo\\nbut the curator to Vincenzo di Rossi; an ascription that would annoy\\nMichelangelo exceedingly, if it were a mistake, since Rossi was a\\npupil of his enemy, the absurd Bandinelli. Mr. W.G. Waters, in his\\n\\\"Italian Sculptors,\\\" considers not only that Michelangelo was the\\nsculptor, but that the work was intended to form part of the tomb of\\nPope Julius. In the second room opposite the main entrance across the\\ncourtyard, we come however to Michelangelo authentic and supreme,\\nfor here are his small David, his Brutus, his Bacchus, and a tondo\\nof the Madonna and Child.\\n\\nAccording to Baedeker the Bacchus and the David revolve. Certainly they\\nare on revolving stands, but to say that they revolve is to disregard\\nutterly the character of the Italian official. A catch holds each in\\nits place, and any effort to release this or to induce the custodian to\\nrelease it is equally futile. \\\"Chiuso\\\" (closed), he replies, and that\\nis final. Useless to explain that the backs of statues can be beautiful\\nas the front; that one of the triumphs of great statuary is its equal\\nperfection from every point; that the revolving stand was not made\\nfor a joke but for a serious purpose. \\\"Chiuso,\\\" he replies. The museum\\ncustodians of Italy are either like this -- jaded figures of apathy -- or\\nthey are enthusiasts. To each enthusiast there are ninety-nine of the\\nother, who either sit in a kind of stupor and watch you with sullen\\nsuspicion, or clear their throats as no gentleman should. The result\\nis that when one meets the enthusiasts one remembers them. There is\\na little dark fellow in the Brera at Milan whose zeal in displaying\\nthe merits of Mantegna's foreshortened Christ is as unforgettable as\\na striking piece of character-acting in a theatre. There is a more\\nreserved but hardly less appreciative official in the Accademia at\\nBologna with a genuine if incommunicable passion for Guido Reni. And,\\nlastly, there is Alfred Branconi, at S. Croce, with his continual and\\nrapturous \\\"It is faine! It is faine!\\\" but he is a private guide. The\\nBargello custodians belong to the other camp.\\n\\nThe fondness of sculptors for David as a subject is due to the fact\\nthat the Florentines, who had spent so much of their time under\\ntyrants and so much of their blood in resisting them, were captivated\\nby the idea of this stripling freeing his compatriots from Goliath\\nand the Philistines. David, as I have said in my remarks on the\\nPiazza della Signoria, stood to them, with Judith, as a champion of\\nliberty. He was alluring also on account of his youth, so attractive\\nto Renaissance sculptors and poets, and the Florentines' admiration\\nwas not diminished by the circumstance that his task was a singularly\\nlight one, since he never came to close quarters with his antagonist\\nat all and had the Lord of Hosts on his side. A David of mythology,\\nPerseus, another Florentine hero, a stripling with what looked like\\na formidable enemy, also enjoyed supernatural assistance.\\n\\nDavid appealed to the greatest sculptors of all -- to Michelangelo,\\nto Donatello, and to Verrocchio; and Michelangelo made two figures,\\none of which is here and the other at the Accademia, and Donatello\\ntwo figures, both of which are here, so that, Verrocchio's example\\nbeing also here, very interesting comparisons are possible.\\n\\nPersonally I put Michelangelo's small David first; it is the one\\nin which, apart from its beauty, you can best believe. His colossal\\nDavid seems to me one of the most glorious things in the world; but it\\nis not David; not the simple, ruddy shepherd lad of the Bible. This\\nDavid could obviously defeat anybody. Donatello's more famous David,\\nin the hat, upstairs, is the most charming creature you ever saw,\\nbut it had been far better to call him something else. Both he and\\nVerrocchio's David, also upstairs, are young tournament nobles rather\\nthan shepherd lads who have slung a stone at a Philistine bully. I see\\nthem both -- but particularly perhaps Verrocchio's -- in the intervals of\\nstrife most acceptably holding up a lady's train, or lying at her feet\\nreading one of Boccaccio's stories; neither could ever have watched\\na flock. Donatello's second David, behind the more famous one, has\\nmore reality; but I would put Michelangelo's smaller one first. And\\nwhat beautiful marble it is -- so rich and warm!\\n\\nOne point which both Donatello's and Verrocchio's David emphasizes\\nis the gulf that was fixed between the Biblical and religious\\nconception of the youthful psalmist and that of these sculptors of the\\nRenaissance. One can, indeed, never think of Donatello as a religious\\nartist. Serious, yes; but not religious, or at any rate not religious\\nin the too common sense of the word, in the sense of appertaining\\nto a special reverential mood distinguished from ordinary moods of\\ndailiness. His David, as I have said, is a comely, cultured boy,\\nwho belongs to the very flower of chivalry and romance. Verrocchio's\\nis akin to him, but he has less radiant mastery. Donatello's David\\nmight be the young lord; Verrocchio's, his page. Here we see the new\\nspirit, the Renaissance, at work, for though religion called it into\\nbeing and the Church continued to be its patron, it rapidly divided\\ninto two halves, and while the painters were bringing all their\\ngenius to glorify sacred history, the scholars were endeavouring to\\nhumanize it. In this task they had no such allies as the sculptors,\\nand particularly Donatello, who, always thinking independently and\\nvigorously, was their best friend. Donatello's David fought also more\\npowerfully for the modern spirit (had he known it) than ever he could\\nhave done in real life with such a large sword in such delicate hands;\\nfor by being the first nude statue of a Biblical character, he made\\nsimpler the way to all humanists in whatever medium they worked.\\n\\nMichelangelo was not often tender. Profoundly sad he could be: indeed\\nhis own head, in bronze, at the Accademia, might stand for melancholy\\nand bitter world-knowledge; but seldom tender; yet the Madonna and\\nChild in the circular bas-relief in this ground-floor room have\\nsomething very nigh tenderness, and a greatness that none of the\\nother Italian sculptors, however often they attempted this subject,\\never reached. The head of Mary in this relief is, I think, one of the\\nmost beautiful things in Florence, none the less so for the charming\\nhead-dress which the great austere artist has given her. The Child\\nis older than is usual in such groups, and differs in another way,\\nfor tiring of a reading lesson, He has laid His arm upon the book:\\na pretty touch.\\n\\nMichelangelo's Bacchus, an early work, is opposite. It is a remarkable\\nproof of his extraordinary range that the same little room should\\ncontain the David, the Madonna, the Brutus, and the Bacchus. In\\nDavid one can believe, as I have said, as the young serious stalwart\\nof the Book of Kings. The Madonna, although perhaps a shade too\\nintellectual -- or at any rate more intellectual and commanding than\\nthe other great artists have accustomed us to think of her -- has a\\nsweet gravity and power and almost domestic tenderness. The Brutus\\nis powerful and modern and realistic; while Bacchus is steeped in the\\nGreek spirit, and the little faun hiding behind him is the very essence\\nof mischief. Add to these the fluid vigour of the unfinished relief\\nof the Martyrdom of S. Andrew, No. 126, and you have five examples of\\nhuman accomplishment that would be enough without the other Florentine\\nevidences at all -- the Medici chapel tombs and the Duomo Pieta.\\n\\nThe inscription under the Brutus says: \\\"While the sculptor was carving\\nthe statue of Brutus in marble, he thought of the crime and held\\nhis hand\\\"; and the theory is that Michelangelo was at work upon this\\nhead at Rome when, in 1537, Lorenzino de' Medici, who claimed to be\\na modern Brutus, murdered Alessandro de' Medici. But it might easily\\nhave been that the sculptor was concerned only with Brutus the friend\\nof C\\u00e6sar and revolted at his crime. The circumstance that the head\\nis unfinished matters nothing. Once seen it can never be forgotten.\\n\\nAlthough Michelangelo is, as always, the dominator, this room has\\nother possessions to make it a resort of visitors. At the end is a\\nfireplace from the Casa Borgherini, by Benedetto da Rovezzano, which\\nprobably has not an equal, although the pietra serena of which it is\\nmade is a horrid hue; and on the walls are fragments of the tomb of\\nS. Giovanni Gualberto at Vallombrosa, designed by the same artist but\\nnever finished. Benedetto (1474-1556) has a peculiar interest to the\\nEnglish in having come to England in 1524 at the bidding of Cardinal\\nWolsey to design a tomb for that proud prelate. On Wolsey's disgrace,\\nHenry VIII decided that the tomb should be continued for his own bones;\\nbut the sculptor died first and it was unfinished. Later Charles I cast\\nenvious eyes upon it and wished to lie within it; but circumstances\\ndeprived him too of the honour. Finally, after having been despoiled\\nof certain bronze additions, the sarcophagus was used for the remains\\nof Nelson, which it now holds, in St. Paul's crypt. The Borgherini\\nfireplace is a miracle of exquisite work, everything having received\\nthought, the delicate traceries on the pillars not less than the\\nfrieze. The fireplace is in perfect condition, not one head having\\nbeen knocked off, but the Gualberto reliefs are badly damaged, yet\\nfull of life. The angel under the saint's bier in No. 104 almost moves.\\n\\nIn this room look also at the beautiful blades of barley on the\\npillars in the corner close to Brutus, and the lovely frieze by an\\nunknown hand above Michelangelo's Martyrdom of S. Andrew, and the\\ncarving upon the two niches for statues on either side of the door.\\n\\nThe little room through which one passes to the Michelangelos may\\nwell be lingered in. There is a gravely fine floor-tomb of a nun\\nto the left of the door -- No. 20 -- which one would like to see in its\\nproper position instead of upright against the wall; and a stone font\\nin the middle which is very fine. There is also a beautiful tomb by\\nGiusti da Settignano, and the iron gates are worth attention.\\n\\nFrom Michelangelo let us ascend the stairs, past the splendid gates,\\nto Donatello; and here a word about that sculptor, for though we\\nmeet him again and again in Florence (yet never often enough) it is\\nin the upper room in the Bargello that he is enthroned. Of Donatello\\nthere is nothing known but good, and good of the most captivating\\nvariety. Not only was he a great creative genius, equally the first\\nmodern sculptor and the sanest, but he was himself tall and comely,\\nopen-handed, a warm friend, humorous and of vigorous intellect. A\\nhint of the affection in which he was held is obtained from his name\\nDonatello, which is a pet diminutive of Donato -- his full style being\\nDonato di Niccol\\u00f2 di Betto Bardi. Born in 1386, four years before\\nFra Angelico and nearly a century after Giotto, he was the son of a\\nwell-to-do wool-comber who was no stranger to the perils of political\\nenergy in these times. Of Donatello's youth little is known, but it is\\nalmost certain that he helped Ghiberti with his first Baptistery doors,\\nbeing thirteen when that sculptor began upon them. At sixteen he was\\nhimself enrolled as a sculptor. It was soon after this that, as I have\\nsaid in the first chapter, he accompanied his friend Brunelleschi,\\nwho was thirteen years his senior, to Rome; and returning alone he\\nbegan work in Florence in earnest, both for the cathedral and campanile\\nand for Or San Michele. In 1425 he took into partnership Michelozzo,\\nand became, with him, a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of Cosimo de' Medici, with whom both\\ncontinued on friendly terms for the rest of their lives. In 1433 he\\nwas in Rome again, probably not sorry to be there since Cosimo had\\nbeen banished and had taken Michelozzo with him. On the triumphant\\nreturn of Cosimo in 1434 Donatello's most prosperous period began;\\nfor he was intimate with the most powerful man in Florence, was\\nhonoured by him, and was himself at the useful age of forty-four.\\n\\nOf Donatello as an innovator I have said something above, in\\nconsidering the Florentine Davids, but he was also the inventor of\\nthat low relief in which his school worked, called rilievo stiacciato,\\nof which there are some excellent examples at South Kensington. In\\nGhiberti's high relief, breaking out often into completely detached\\nfigures, he was also a master, as we shall see at S. Lorenzo. But his\\ngreatest claim to distinction is his psychological insight allied\\nto perfect mastery of form. His statues were not only the first\\nreally great statues since the Greeks, but are still (always leaving\\nMichelangelo on one side as abnormal) the greatest modern examples\\njudged upon a realistic basis. Here in the Bargello, in originals and\\nin casts, he may be adequately appreciated; but to Padua his admirers\\nmust certainly go, for the bronze equestrian statue of Gattamelata is\\nthere. Donatello was painted by his friend Masaccio at the Carmine,\\nbut the fresco has perished. He is to be seen in the Uffizi portico,\\nalthough that is probably a fancy representation; and again on a tablet\\nin the wall opposite the apse of the Duomo. The only contemporary\\nportrait (and this is very doubtful) is in a picture in the Louvre\\ngiven to Uccello -- a serious, thoughtful, bearded face with steady,\\nobservant eyes: one of five heads, the others being Giotto, Manetti,\\nBrunelleschi, and Uccello himself.\\n\\nDonatello, who never married, but lived for much of his life with his\\nmother and sister, died at a great age, cared for both by Cosimo de'\\nMedici and his son and successor Piero. He was buried with Cosimo\\nin S. Lorenzo. Vasari tells us that he was free, affectionate, and\\ncourteous, but of a high spirit and capable of sudden anger, as when\\nhe destroyed with a blow a head he had made for a mean patron who\\nobjected to its very reasonable price. \\\"He thought,\\\" says Vasari,\\n\\\"nothing of money, keeping it in a basket suspended from the ceiling,\\nso that all his workmen and friends took what they wanted without\\nsaying anything.\\\" He was as careless of dress as great artists have\\never been, and of a handsome robe which Cosimo gave him he complained\\nthat it spoiled his work. When he was dying his relations affected\\ngreat concern in the hope of inheriting a farm at Prato, but he told\\nthem that he had left it to the peasant who had always toiled there,\\nand he would not alter his will.\\n\\nThe Donatello collection in the Bargello has been made representative\\nby the addition of casts. The originals number ten: there is also\\na cast of the equestrian statue of Gattemalata at Padua, which is,\\nI suppose, next to Verrocchio's Bartolommeo Colleoni at Venice, the\\nfinest equestrian statue that exists; heads from various collections,\\nincluding M. Dreyfus' in Paris, although Dr. Bode now gives that\\ncharming example to Donatello's pupil Desiderio; and various\\nother masterpieces elsewhere. But it is the originals that chiefly\\ninterest us, and first of these in bronze is the David, of which I\\nhave already spoken, and first of these in marble the S. George. This\\nGeorge is just such a resolute, clean, warlike idealist as one dreams\\nhim. He would kill a dragon, it is true; but he would eat and sleep\\nafter it and tell the story modestly and not without humour. By a\\nhappy chance the marble upon which Donatello worked had light veins\\nrunning through it just where the head is, with the result that the\\nface seems to possess a radiance of its own. This statue was made for\\nOr San Michele, where it used to stand until 1891, when the present\\nbronze replica that takes its place was made. The spirited marble\\nfrieze underneath it at Or San Michele is the original and has been\\nthere for centuries. It was this S. George whom Ruskin took as the\\nhead and inspiration of his Saint George's Guild.\\n\\nThe David is interesting not only in itself but as being the first\\nisolated statue of modern times. It was made for Cosimo de' Medici,\\nto stand in the courtyard of the Medici palace (now the Riccardi),\\nand until that time, since antiquity, no one had made a statue to\\nstand on a pedestal and be observable from all points. Hitherto modern\\nsculptors had either made reliefs or statues for niches. It was also\\nthe first nude statue of modern times; and once again one has the\\nsatisfaction of recognizing that the first was the best. At any rate,\\nno later sculptor has made anything more charming than this figure,\\nor more masterly within its limits.\\n\\nAfter the S. George and the bronze David, the two most memorable things\\nare the adorable bronze Amorino in its quaint little trousers -- or\\nperhaps not Amorino at all, since it is trampling on a snake,\\nwhich such little sprites did not do -- and the coloured terra-cotta\\nbust called Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano, so like life as to be after a while\\ndisconcerting. The sensitiveness of the mouth can never have been\\nexcelled. The other originals include the gaunt John the Baptist with\\nits curious little moustache, so far removed from the Amorino and so\\nadmirable a proof of the sculptor's vigilant thoughtfulness in all\\nhe did; the relief of the infant John, one of the most animated of\\nthe heads (the Baptist at all periods of his life being a favourite\\nwith this sculptor); three bronze heads, of which those of the Young\\nGentleman and the Roman Emperor remain most clearly in my mind. But\\nthe authorship of the Roman Emperor is very doubtful. And lastly the\\nglorious Marzocco -- the lion from the front of the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nfirmly holding the Florentine escutcheon against the world. Florence\\nhas other Donatellos -- the Judith in the Loggia de' Lanzi, the figures\\non Giotto's campanile, the Annunciation in S. Croce, and above all\\nthe cantoria in the Museum of the Cathedral; but this room holds most\\nof his strong sweet genius. Here (for there are seldom more than two\\nor three persons in it) you can be on terms with him.\\n\\nAfter the Donatellos we should see the other Renaissance sculpture. But\\nfirst the Carrand collection of ivories, pictures, jewels, carvings,\\nvestments, plaquettes, and objets d'art, bequeathed to Florence\\nin 1888. Everything here is good and worth examination. Among the\\noutstanding things is a plaquette, No. 393, a Satyr and a Bacchante,\\nattributed to Donatello, under the title \\\"Allegory of Spring,\\\" which\\nis the work of a master and a very riot of mythological imagery. The\\nneighbouring plaquettes, many of them of the school of Donatello,\\nare all beautiful.\\n\\nWe now find the sixth salon, to see Verrocchio's David, of which I have\\nalready spoken. This wholly charming boy, a little nearer life perhaps\\nthan Donatello's, although not quite so radiantly distinguished,\\nillustrates the association of Verrocchio and Leonardo as clearly\\nas any of the paintings do; for the head is sheer Leonardo. At the\\nPalazzo Vecchio we saw Verrocchio's boy with the dolphin -- that happy\\nbronze lyric -- and outside Or San Michele his Christ and S. Thomas, in\\nDonatello and Michelozzo's niche, with the flying cherubim beneath. But\\nas with Donatello, so with Verrocchio, one must visit the Bargello\\nto see him, in Florence, most intimately. For here are not only his\\nDavid, which once known can never be forgotten and is as full of the\\nRenaissance spirit as anything ever fashioned, whether in bronze,\\nmarble, or paint, but -- upstairs -- certain other wonderfully beautiful\\nthings to which we shall come, and, that being so, I would like here\\nto say a little about their author.\\n\\nVerrocchio is a nickname, signifying the true eye. Andrea's real name\\nwas de' Cioni; he is known to fame as Andrea of the true eye, and since\\nhe had acquired this style at a time when every eye was true enough,\\nhis must have been true indeed. It is probable that he was a pupil\\nof Donatello, who in 1435, when Andrea was born, was forty-nine, and\\nin time he was to become the master of Leonardo: thus are the great\\nartists related. The history of Florentine art is practically the\\nhistory of a family; one artist leads to the other -- the genealogy\\nof genius. The story goes that it was the excellence of the angel\\ncontributed by Leonardo to his master's picture of the Baptism of\\nChrist (at the Accademia) which decided Verrocchio to paint no more,\\njust as Ghiberti's superiority in the relief of Abraham and Isaac\\ndrove Brunelleschi from sculpture. If this be so, it accounts for the\\nextraordinarily small number of pictures by him. Like many artists\\nof his day Verrocchio was also a goldsmith, but he was versatile\\nabove most, even when versatility was a habit, and excelled also as\\na musician. Both Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo employed him to design\\ntheir tournament costumes; and it was for Lorenzo that he made this\\ncharming David and the boy and the dolphin. His greatest work of all\\nis the bronze equestrian statue of Bartolommeo Colleoni in Venice, the\\nfinest thing of its kind in the world, and so glorious and exciting\\nindeed that every city should have a cast of it in a conspicuous\\nposition just for the good of the people. It was while at work upon\\nthis that Verrocchio died, at the age of fifty-three. His body was\\nbrought from Venice by his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who adored him,\\nand was buried in S. Ambrogio in Florence. Lorenzo di Credi painted his\\nportrait, which is now in the Uffizi -- a plump, undistinguished-looking\\nlittle man.\\n\\nIn the David room are also the extremely interesting rival bronze\\nreliefs of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, which were made by Ghiberti and\\nBrunelleschi as trials of skill to see which would win the commission\\nto design the new gates of the Baptistery, as I have told earlier in\\nthis book. Six competitors entered for the contest; but Ghiberti's and\\nBrunelleschi's efforts were alone considered seriously. A comparison\\nof these two reliefs proves that Ghiberti, at any rate, had a finer\\nsense of grouping. He filled the space at his disposal more easily\\nand his hand was more fluent; but there is a very engaging vivacity\\nin the other work, the realistic details of which are so arresting\\nas to make one regret that Brunelleschi had for sculpture so little\\ntime. In S. Maria Novella is that crucifix in wood which he carved for\\nhis friend Donatello, but his only other sculptured work in Florence is\\nthe door of his beautiful Pazzi chapel in the cloisters of S. Croce. Of\\nGhiberti's Baptistery gates I have said more elsewhere. Enough here\\nto add that the episode of Abraham and Isaac does not occur in them.\\n\\nThis little room also has a Cassa Reliquiaria by Ghiberti, below a fine\\nrelief by Bertoldo, Michelangelo's master in sculpture, representing\\na battle between the Romans and the Barbarians; cases of exquisite\\nbronzes; the head, in bronze (No. 25), of an old placid, shrewd woman,\\nexecuted from a death-mask, which the photographers call Contessina\\nde' Bardi, wife of Cosimo de' Medici, by Donatello, but which cannot\\nbe so, since the sculptor died first; heads of Apollo and two babies,\\nover the Ghiberti and Brunelleschi competition reliefs; a crucifixion\\nby Bertoldo; a row of babies representing the triumph of Bacchus; and\\nbelow these a case of medals and plaquettes, every one a masterpiece.\\n\\nThe next room, Sala VII, is apportioned chiefly between Cellini\\nand Gian or Giovanni da Bologna, the two sculptors who dominate the\\nLoggia de' Lanzi. Here we may see models for Cellini's Perseus in\\nbronze and wax and also for the relief of the rescue of Andromeda,\\nunder the statue; his Cosimo I, with the wart (omitted by Bandinelli\\nin the head downstairs, which pairs with Michelangelo's Brutus);\\nand various smaller works. But personally I find that Cellini will\\nnot do in such near proximity to Donatello, Verrocchio, and their\\ngentle followers. He was, of course, far later. He was not born (in\\n1500) until Donatello had been dead thirty-four years, Mino da Fiesole\\nsixteen years, Desiderio da Settignano thirty-six years, and Verrocchio\\ntwelve years. He thus did not begin to work until the finer impulses\\nof the Renaissance were exhausted. Giovanni da Bologna, although he,\\nit is true, was even later (1524-1608), I find more sympathetic; while\\nLandor boldly proclaimed him superior to Michelangelo. His \\\"Mercury,\\\"\\nin the middle of the room, which one sees counterfeited in all the\\nstatuary shops of Florence, is truly very nearly light as air. If ever\\nbronze floated, this figure does. His cherubs and dolphins are very\\nskilful and merry; his turkey and eagle and other animals indicate\\nthat he had humility. John of Bologna is best known at Florence by\\nhis Rape of the Sabines and Hercules and Nessus in the Loggia de'\\nLanzi; but the Boboli gardens have a fine group of Oceanus and river\\ngods by him in the midst of a lake. Before leaving this room look at\\nthe relief of Christ in glory (No. 35), to the left of the door, by\\nJacopo Sansovino, a rival of Michelangelo, which is most admirable,\\nand at the case of bronze animals by Pietro Tacca, John of Bologna's\\npupil, who made the famous boar (a copy of an ancient marble) at\\nthe Mercato Nuovo and the reliefs for the pediment of the statue of\\nCosimo I (by his master) in the Piazza della Signoria. But I believe\\nthat the most beautiful thing in this room is the bronze figure for\\nthe tomb of Mariano Sozzino by Lorenzo di Pietro.\\n\\nBefore we look at the della Robbias, which are in the two large rooms\\nupstairs, let us finish with the marble and terra-cotta statuary in\\nthe two smaller rooms to the left as one passes through the first\\ndella Robbia room. In the first of them, corresponding to the room\\nwith Verrocchio's David downstairs, we find Verrocchio again, with\\na bust of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici (whom Botticelli painted in\\nthe Uffizi holding a medal in his hand) and a most exquisite Madonna\\nand Child in terra-cotta from S. Maria Nuova. (This is on a hinge,\\nfor better light, but the official skies will fall if you touch\\nit.) Here also is the bust of a young warrior by Antonio Pollaiuolo\\n(1429-1498) who was Verrocchio's closest rival and one of Ghiberti's\\nassistants for the second Baptistery doors. His greatest work is at\\nRome, but this bust is indescribably charming, and the softness of the\\nboy's contours is almost of life. It is sometimes called Giuliano de'\\nMedici. Other beautiful objects in the room are the terra-cotta Madonna\\nand Child by Andrea Sansovino (1460-1529), Pollaiuolo's pupil, which\\nis as radiant although not so domestically lovely as Verrocchio's;\\nthe bust by Benedetto da Maiano (1442-1497) of Pietro Mellini, that\\nshrewd and wrinkled patron of the Church who presented to S. Croce\\nthe famous pulpit by this sculptor; an ancient lady, by the door,\\nin coloured terra-cotta, who is thought to represent Monna Tessa, the\\nnurse of Dante's Beatrice; and certain other works by that delightful\\nand prolific person Ignoto Fiorentino, who here, and in the next room,\\nwhich we now enter, is at his best.\\n\\nThis next priceless room is chiefly memorable for Verrocchio and\\nMino da Fiesole. We come to Verrocchio at once, on the left, where\\nhis relief of the death of Francesca Pitti Tornabuoni (on a tiny\\nbed only half as long as herself) may be seen. This poor lady, who\\ndied in childbirth, was the wife of Giovanni Tornabuoni, and he it\\nwas who employed Ghirlandaio to make the frescoes in the choir of\\nS. Maria Novella. (I ought, however, to state that Miss Cruttwell,\\nin her monograph on Verrocchio, questions both the subject and the\\nartist.) Close by we have two more works by Verrocchio -- No. 180, a\\nmarble relief of the Madonna and Child, the Madonna's dress fastened\\nby the prettiest of brooches, and She herself possessing a dainty sad\\nhead and the long fingers that Verrocchio so favoured, which we find\\nagain in the famous \\\"Gentildonna\\\" (No. 181) next it -- that Florentine\\nlady with flowers in her bosom, whose contours are so exquisite and\\nwho has such pretty shoulders.\\n\\nNear by is the little eager S. John the Baptist as a boy by Antonio\\nRossellino (1427-1478), and on the next wall the same sculptor's\\ncircular relief of the Madonna adoring, in a border of cherubs.\\nIn the middle is the masterpiece of Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570): a\\nBacchus, so strangely like a genuine antique, full of Greek lightness\\nand grace. And then we come back to the wall in which the door is,\\nand find more works from the delicate hand of Mino da Fiesole, whom\\nwe in London are fortunate in being able to study as near home as at\\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum. Of Mino I have said more both at the\\nBadia and at Fiesole. But here I might remark again that he was born\\nin 1431 and died in 1484, and was the favourite pupil of Desiderio\\nda Settignano, who was in his turn the favourite pupil of Donatello.\\n\\nIn the little church of S. Ambrogio we have seen a tablet to the\\nmemory of Mino, who lies there, not far from the grave of Verrocchio,\\nwhom he most nearly approached in feeling, although their ideal type of\\nwoman differed in everything save the slenderness of the fingers. The\\nBargello has both busts and reliefs by him, all distinguished and\\nsensitive and marked by Mino's profound refinement. The Madonna and\\nChild in No. 232 are peculiarly beautiful and notable both for high\\nrelief and shallow relief, and the Child in No. 193 is even more\\ncharming. For delicacy and vivacity in marble portraiture it would\\nbe impossible to surpass the head of Rinaldo della Luna; and the two\\nMedicis are wonderfully real. Everything in Mino's work is thoughtful\\nand exquisite, while the unusual type of face which so attracted him\\ngives him freshness too.\\n\\nThis room and that next it illustrate the wealth of fine sculptors\\nwhich Florence had in the fifteenth century, for the works by the\\nunknown hands are in some cases hardly less beautiful and masterly than\\nthose by the known. Look, for example, at the fleur-de-lis over the\\ndoor; at the Madonna and Child next it, on the right; at the girl's\\nhead next to that; at the baby girl at the other end of the room;\\nand at the older boy and his pendant. But one does not need to come\\nhere to form an idea of the wealth of good sculpture. The streets\\nalone are full of it. Every palace has beautiful stone-work and an\\nescutcheon which often only a master could execute -- as Donatello\\ndevised that for the Palazzo Pazzi in the Borgo degli Albizzi. On the\\ngreat staircase of the Bargello, for example, are numbers of coats\\nof arms that could not be more beautifully designed and incised.\\n\\nIn the room leading from that which is memorable for Pollaiuolo's\\nyouth in armour is a collection of medals by all the best medallists,\\nbeginning, in the first case, with Pisanello. Here are his Sigismondo\\nMalatesta, the tyrant of Rimini, and Isotta his wife; here also is\\na portrait of Leon Battista Alberti, who designed and worked on the\\ncathedral of Rimini as well as upon S. Maria Novella in Florence. On\\nthe other side of this case is the medal commemorating the Pazzi\\nconspiracy. In other cases are pretty Italian ladies, such as Julia\\nAstalla, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, with her hair in curls just as in\\nGhirlandaio's frescoes, Costanza Rucellai, Leonora Altoviti, Maria\\nPoliziano, and Maria de' Mucini.\\n\\nAnd so we come to the della Robbias, without whose joyous, radiant\\nart Florence would be only half as beautiful as she is. Of these\\nexquisite artists Luca, the uncle, born in 1400, was by far the\\ngreatest. Andrea, his nephew, born in 1435, came next, and then\\nGiovanni. Luca seems to have been a serious, quiet man who would\\nprobably have made sculpture not much below his friend Donatello's had\\nnot he chanced on the discovery of a means of colouring and glazing\\nterra-cotta. Examples of this craft are seen all over Florence both\\nwithin doors and out, as the pages of this book indicate, but at the\\nBargello is the greatest number of small pieces gathered together. I\\ndo not say there is anything here more notable than the Annunciation\\nattributed to Andrea at the Spedale degli Innocenti, while of course,\\nfor most people, his putti on the fa\\u00e7ade of that building are the\\ndella Robbia symbol; nor is there anything finer than Luca's work\\nat Impruneta; but as a collection of sweetness and gentle domestic\\nbeauty these Bargello reliefs are unequalled, both in character and in\\nvolume. Here you see what one might call Roman Catholic art -- that is,\\nthe art which at once gives pleasure to simple souls and symbolizes\\nbenevolence and safety -- carried out to its highest power. Tenderness,\\nhappiness, and purity are equally suggested by every relief here. Had\\nLuca and Andrea been entrusted with the creation of the world it\\nwould be a paradise. And, as it is, it seems to me impossible but\\nthat they left the world sweeter than they found it. Such examples\\nof affection and solicitude as they were continually bringing to the\\npopular vision must have engendered kindness.\\n\\nI have noted as especially beautiful in the first room Nos. 4,\\n6, 12, 23, by Andrea; and 10 and 21, by Luca. These, by the\\nway, are the Bargello ascriptions, but the experts do not always\\nagree. Herr Bode, for example, who has studied the della Robbias with\\npassionate thoroughness, gives the famous head of the boy, which is\\nin reproduction one of the best-known works of plastic art, to Luca;\\nbut the Bargello director says Andrea. In Herr Bode's fascinating\\nmonograph, \\\"Florentine Sculptors of the Renaissance,\\\" he goes very\\ncarefully into the differences between the uncle and the nephew,\\nmaster and pupil. In all the groups, for example, he says that Luca\\nplaces the Child on the Madonna's left arm, Andrea on the right. In\\nthe second room I have marked particularly Nos. 21, 28, and 31,\\nby Luca, 28 being a deeper relief than usual, and the Madonna not\\nadoring but holding and delighting in one of the most adorable of\\nBabies. Observe in the reproduction of this relief in this volume -- \\nhow the Mother's fingers sink into the child's flesh. Luca was the\\nfirst sculptor to notice that. No. 31 is the lovely Madonna of the\\nRose Bower. But nothing gives me more pleasure than the boy's head of\\nwhich I have just spoken, attributed to Andrea and also reproduced\\nhere. The \\\"Giovane Donna\\\" which pairs with it has extraordinary\\ncharm and delicacy too. I have marked also, by Andrea, Nos. 71 and\\n76. Giovanni della Robbia's best is perhaps No. 15, in the other room.\\n\\nOne curious thing that one notes about della Robbia pottery is its\\ninability to travel. It was made for the church and it should remain\\nthere. Even in the Bargello, where there is an ancient environment,\\nit loses half its charm; while in an English museum it becomes hard\\nand cold. But in a church to which the poor carry their troubles,\\nwith a dim light and a little incense, it is perfect, far beyond\\npainting in its tenderness and symbolic value. I speak of course\\nof the Madonnas and altar-pieces. When the della Robbias worked for\\nthe open air -- as in the fa\\u00e7ade of the Children's Hospital, or at the\\nCertosa, or in the Loggia di San Paolo, opposite S. Maria Novella,\\nwhere one may see the beautiful meeting of S. Francis and S. Dominic,\\nby Andrea -- they seem, in Italy, to have fitness enough; but it would\\nnot do to transplant any of these reliefs to an English fa\\u00e7ade. There\\nwas once, I might add, in Florence a Via della Robbia, but it is now\\nthe Via Nazionale. I suppose this injustice to the great potters came\\nabout in the eighteen-sixties, when popular political enthusiasm led\\nto every kind of similar re-naming.\\n\\nIn the room leading out of the second della Robbia room is a collection\\nof vestments and brocades bequeathed by Baron Giulio Franchetti, where\\nyou may see, dating from as far back as the sixth century, designs\\nthat for beauty and splendour and durability put to shame most of the\\nstuffs now woven; but the top floor of the Museo Archeologico in the\\nVia della Colonna is the chief home in Florence of such treasures.\\n\\nThere are other beautiful things in the Bargello of which I have said\\nnothing -- a gallery of mediaeval bells most exquisitely designed, from\\nfamous steeples; cases of carved ivory; and many of such treasures as\\none sees at the Cluny in Paris. But it is for its courtyard and for the\\nRenaissance sculpture that one goes to the Bargello, and returns again\\nand again to the Bargello, and it is for these that one remembers it.\\n\\nOn returning to London the first duty of every one who has drunk\\ndeep of delight in the Bargello is to visit that too much neglected\\ntreasure-house of our own, the Victoria and Albert Museum at South\\nKensington. There may be nothing at South Kensington as fine as the\\nBargello's finest, but it is a priceless collection and is superior\\nto the Bargello in one respect at any rate, for it has a relief\\nattributed to Leonardo. Here also is an adorable Madonna and laughing\\nChild, beyond anything in Florence for sheer gaiety if not mischief,\\nwhich the South Kensington authorities call a Rossellino but Herr\\nBode a Desiderio da Settignano. The room is rich too in Donatello\\nand in Verrocchio, and altogether it makes a perfect footnote to the\\nBargello. It also has within call learned gentlemen who can give\\nintimate information about the exhibits, which the Bargello badly\\nlacks. The Louvre and the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin -- but\\nparticularly the Kaiser Friedrich since Herr Bode, who has such\\na passion for this period, became its director -- have priceless\\ntreasures, and in Paris I have had the privilege of seeing the little\\nbut exquisite collection formed by M. Gustave Dreyfus, dominated by\\nthat mirthful Italian child which the Bargello authorities consider to\\nbe by Donatello, but Herr Bode gives to Desiderio. At the Louvre, in\\ngalleries on the ground floor gained through the Egyptian sculpture\\nsection and opened very capriciously, may be seen the finest of\\nthe prisoners from Michelangelo's tomb for Pope Julius; Donatello's\\nyouthful Baptist; a Madonna and Children by Agostino di Duccio, whom\\nwe saw at the Museum of the Cathedral; an early coloured terra-cotta\\nby Luca della Robbia, and No. 316, a terra-cotta Madonna and Child\\nwithout ascription, which looks very like Rossellino.\\n\\nIn addition to originals there are at South Kensington casts of many\\nof the Bargello's most valuable possessions, such as Donatello's\\nand Verrocchio's Davids, Donatello's Baptist and many heads, Mino\\nda Fiesole's best Madonna, Pollaiuolo's Young Warrior, and so forth;\\nso that to loiter there is most attractively to recapture something\\nof the Florentine feeling.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nS. Croce\\n\\nAn historic piazza -- Marble fa\\u00e7ades -- Florence's Westminster\\nAbbey -- Galileo's ancestor and Ruskin -- Benedetto's\\npulpit -- Michelangelo's tomb -- A fond lady -- Donatello's\\nAnnunciation -- Giotto's frescoes -- S. Francis -- Donatello magnanimous -- The\\ngifted Alberti -- Desiderio's great tomb -- The sacristy -- The Medici\\nchapel -- The Pazzi chapel -- Old Jacopo desecrated -- A Restoration.\\n\\nThe piazza S. Croce now belongs to children. The church is at one\\nend, bizarre buildings are on either side, the Dante statue is in the\\nmiddle, and harsh gravel covers the ground. Everywhere are children,\\nall dirty, and all rather squalid and mostly bow-legged, showing that\\nthey were of the wrong age to take their first steps on Holy Saturday\\nat noon. The long brown building on the right, as we face S. Croce,\\nis a seventeenth-century palazzo. For the rest, the architecture is\\nchiefly notable for green shutters.\\n\\nThe frigid and florid Dante memorial, which was unveiled in 1865 on\\nthe six hundredth anniversary of the poet's birthday, looks gloomily\\nupon what once was a scene of splendour and animation, for in 1469\\nPiero de' Medici devised here a tournament in honour of the betrothal\\nof Lorenzo to Clarice Orsini. The Queen of the tournament was Lucrezia\\nDonati, and she awarded the first prize to Lorenzo. The tournament cost\\n10,000 gold florins and was very splendid, Verrocchio and other artists\\nbeing called in to design costumes, and it is thought that Pollaiuolo's\\nterra-cotta of the Young Warrior in the Bargello represents the comely\\nGiuliano de' Medici as he appeared in his armour in the lists. The\\npiazza was the scene also of that famous tournament given by Lorenzo\\nde' Medici for Giuliano in 1474, of which the beautiful Simonetta\\nwas the Queen of Beauty, and to which, as I have said elsewhere, we\\nowe Botticelli's two most famous pictures. Difficult to reconstruct\\nin the Piazza any of those glories to-day.\\n\\nThe new fa\\u00e7ade of S. Croce, endowed not long since by an Englishman,\\nhas been much abused, but it is not so bad. As the front of so\\nbeautiful and wonderful a church it may be inadequate, but as a\\nstructure of black and white marble it will do. To my mind nothing\\nsatisfactory can now be done in this medium, which, unless it is\\ncenturies old, is always harsh and cuts the sky like a knife, instead\\nof resting against it as architecture should. But when it is old,\\nas at S. Miniato, it is right.\\n\\nS. Croce is the Westminster Abbey of Florence. Michelangelo lies here,\\nMachiavelli lies here, Galileo lies here; and here Giotto painted,\\nDonatello carved, and Brunelleschi planned. Although outside the church\\nis disappointing, within it is the most beautiful in Florence. It\\nhas the boldest arches, the best light at all seasons, the most\\nattractive floor -- of gentle red -- and an apse almost wholly made of\\ncoloured glass. Not a little of its charm comes from the delicate\\npassage-way that runs the whole course of the church high up on the\\nyellow walls. It also has the finest circular window in Florence,\\nover the main entrance, a \\\"Deposition\\\" by Ghiberti.\\n\\nThe lightness was indeed once so intense that no fewer than twenty-two\\nwindows had to be closed. The circular window over the altar upon which\\na new roof seems to be intruding is in reality the interloper: the roof\\nis the original one, and the window was cut later, in defiance of good\\narchitecture, by Vasari, who, since he was a pupil of Michelangelo,\\nshould have known better. To him was entrusted the restoration of\\nthe church in the middle of the sixteenth century.\\n\\nThe original architect of the modern S. Croce was the same Arnolfo di\\nCambio, or Lapo, who began the Duomo. He had some right to be chosen\\nsince his father, Jacopo, or Lapo, a German, was the builder of the\\nmost famous of all the Franciscan churches -- that at Assisi, which was\\nbegun while S. Francis was still living. And Giotto, who painted in\\nthat church his most famous frescoes, depicting scenes in the life\\nof S. Francis, succeeded Arnolfo here, as at the Duomo, with equal\\nfitness. Arnolfo began S. Croce in 1294, the year that the building of\\nthe Duomo was decided upon, as a reply to the new Dominican Church of\\nS. Maria Novella, and to his German origin is probably due the Northern\\nimpression which the interiors both of S. Croce and the Duomo convey.\\n\\nThe first thing to examine in S. Croce is the floor-tomb, close to the\\ncentre door, upon which Ruskin wrote one of his most characteristic\\npassages. The tomb is of an ancestor of Galileo (who lies close\\nby, but beneath a florid monument), and it represents a mediaeval\\nscholarly figure with folded hands. Ruskin writes: \\\"That worn face is\\nstill a perfect portrait of the old man, though like one struck out\\nat a venture, with a few rough touches of a master's chisel. And that\\nfalling drapery of his cap is, in its few lines, faultless, and subtle\\nbeyond description. And now, here is a simple but most useful test of\\nyour capacity for understanding Florentine sculpture or painting. If\\nyou can see that the lines of that cap are both right, and lovely; that\\nthe choice of the folds is exquisite in its ornamental relations of\\nline; and that the softness and ease of them is complete, -- though only\\nsketched with a few dark touches, -- then you can understand Giotto's\\ndrawing, and Botticelli's; Donatello's carving and Luca's. But if\\nyou see nothing in this sculpture, you will see nothing in theirs,\\nof theirs. Where they choose to imitate flesh, or silk, or to play any\\nvulgar modern trick with marble -- (and they often do) -- whatever, in a\\nword, is French, or American, or Cockney, in their work, you can see;\\nbut what is Florentine, and for ever great -- unless you can see also\\nthe beauty of this old man in his citizen's cap, -- you will see never.\\\"\\n\\nThe passage is in \\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" which begins with S. Croce\\nand should be read by every one visiting the city. And here let me\\nadvise another companion for this church: a little dark enthusiast, in\\na black skull cap, named Alfred Branconi, who is usually to be found\\njust inside the doors, but may be secured as a guide by a postcard\\nto the church. Signor Branconi knows S. Croce and he loves it, and\\nhe has the further qualifications of knowing all Florence too and\\nspeaking excellent English, which he taught himself.\\n\\nThe S. Croce pulpit, which is by Benedetto da Maiano, is a satisfying\\nthing, accomplished both in proportions and workmanship, with panels\\nillustrating scenes in the life of S. Francis. These are all most\\ngently and persuasively done, influenced, of course, by the Baptistery\\ndoors, but individual too, and full of a kindred sweetness and\\nliveliness. The scenes are the \\\"Confirmation of the Franciscan Order\\\"\\n(the best, I think); the \\\"Burning of the Books\\\"; the \\\"Stigmata,\\\"\\nwhich we shall see again in the church, in fresco, for here we are\\nall dedicated to the saint of Assisi, not yet having come upon the\\nstern S. Dominic, the ruler at S. Marco and S. Maria Novella; the\\n\\\"Death of S. Francis,\\\" very real and touching, which we shall also\\nsee again; and the execution of certain Franciscans. Benedetto,\\nwho was also an architect and made the plan of the Strozzi palace,\\nwas so unwilling that anything should mar the scheme of his pulpit,\\nthat after strengthening this pillar with the greatest care and\\nthoroughness, he hollowed it and placed the stairs inside.\\n\\nThe first tomb on the right, close to this pulpit, is Michelangelo's,\\na mass of allegory, designed by his friend Vasari, the author of the\\n\\\"Lives of the Artists,\\\" the reading of which is perhaps the best\\npreparation for the understanding of Florence. \\\"If life pleases us,\\\"\\nMichelangelo once said, \\\"we ought not to be grieved by death, which\\ncomes from the same Giver.\\\" Michelangelo had intended the Piet\\u00e0, now\\nin the Duomo, to stand above his grave; but Vasari, who had a little\\nof the Pepys in his nature, thought to do him greater honour by this\\nornateness. The artist was laid to his rest in 1564, but not before his\\nbody was exhumed, by his nephew, at Rome, where the great man had died,\\nand a series of elaborate ceremonies had been performed, which Vasari,\\nwho is here trustworthy enough, describes minutely. All the artists\\nin Florence vied in celebrating the dead master in memorial paintings\\nfor his catafalque and its surroundings, which have now perished;\\nbut probably the loss is not great, except as an example of homage,\\nfor that was a bad period. How bad it was may be a little gauged by\\nVasari's tributory tomb and his window over the high altar.\\n\\nOpposite Michelangelo's tomb, on the pillar, is the pretty but rather\\nVictorian \\\"Madonna del Latte,\\\" surrounded by angels, by Bernardo\\nRossellino (1409-1464), brother of the author of the great tomb at\\nS. Miniato. This pretty relief was commissioned as a family memorial\\nby that Francesco Nori, the close friend of Lorenzo de' Medici, who\\nwas killed in the Duomo during the Pazzi conspiracy in his effort to\\nsave Lorenzo from the assassins.\\n\\nThe tomb of Alfieri, the dramatist, to which we now come, was\\nerected at the cost of his mistress, the Countess of Albany,\\nwho herself sat to Canova for the figure of bereaved Italy. This\\ncurious and unfortunate woman became, at the age of nineteen, the\\nwife of the Young Pretender, twenty-seven years after the '45, and\\nled a miserable existence with him (due chiefly to his depravity,\\nbut a little, she always held, to the circumstance that they chose\\nGood Friday for their wedding day) until Alfieri fell in love with\\nher and offered his protection. Together she and the poet remained,\\napparently contented with each other and received by society, even\\nby the English Royal family, until Alfieri died, in 1803, when after\\nexclaiming that she had lost all -- \\\"consolations, support, society,\\nall, all!\\\" -- and establishing this handsome memorial, she selected the\\nFrench artist Fabre to fill the aching void in her fifty-years-old\\nheart; and Fabre not only filled it until her death in 1824, but\\nbecame the heir of all that had been bequeathed to her by both the\\nStuart and Alfieri. Such was the Countess of Albany, to whom human\\naffection was so necessary. She herself is buried close by, in the\\nchapel of the Castellani.\\n\\nMrs. Piozzi, in her \\\"Glimpses of Italian Society,\\\" mentions seeing\\nin Florence in 1785 the unhappy Pretender. Though old and sickly,\\nhe went much into society, sported the English arms and livery,\\nand wore the garter.\\n\\nOther tombs in the right aisle are those of Machiavelli, the\\nstatesman and author of \\\"The Prince,\\\" and Rossini, the composer of\\n\\\"William Tell,\\\" who died in Paris in 1868, but was brought here for\\nburial. These tombs are modern and of no artistic value, but there\\nis near them a fine fifteenth-century example in the monument by\\nBernardo Rossellino to another statesman and author, Leonardo Bruni,\\nknown as Aretino, who wrote the lives of Dante and Petrarch and a\\nLatin history of Florence, a copy of which was placed on his heart at\\nhis funeral. This tomb is considered to be Rossellino's masterpiece;\\nbut there is one opposite by another hand which dwarfs it.\\n\\nThere is also a work of sculpture near it, in the same wall, which\\ndraws away the eyes -- Donatello's \\\"Annunciation\\\". The experts now think\\nthis to belong to the sculptor's middle period, but Vasari thought it\\nearlier, and makes it the work which had most influence in establishing\\nhis reputation; while according to the archives it was placed in the\\nchurch before Donatello was living. Vasari ought to be better informed\\nupon this point than usual, since it was he who was employed in the\\nsixteenth century to renovate S. Croce, at which time the chapel for\\nwhose altar the relief was made -- that of the Cavalcanti family -- was\\nremoved. The relief now stands unrelated to anything. Every detail of\\nit should be examined; but Alfred Branconi will see to that. The stone\\nis the grey pietra serena of Fiesole, and Donatello has plentifully,\\nbut not too plentifully, lightened it with gold, which is exactly what\\nall artists who used this medium for sculpture should have done. By a\\npleasant tactful touch the designer of the modern Donatello monument\\nin S. Lorenzo has followed the master's lead.\\n\\nAlmost everything of Donatello's that one sees is in turn the best; but\\nstanding before this lovely work one is more than commonly conscious\\nof being in the presence of a wonderful creator. The Virgin is wholly\\nunlike any other woman, and She is surprising and modern even for\\nDonatello with his vast range. The charming terra-cotta boys above\\nare almost without doubt from the same hand, but they cannot have\\nbeen made for this monument.\\n\\nTo the della Robbias we come in the Castellani chapel in the right\\ntransept, which has two full-length statues by either Luca or\\nAndrea, in the gentle glazed medium, of S. Francis and S. Bernard,\\nquite different from anything we have seen or shall see, because\\nisolated. The other full-size figures by these masters -- such as\\nthose at Impruneta -- are placed against the wall. The S. Bernard,\\non the left as one enters the chapel, is far the finer. It surely\\nmust be one of the most beautiful male draped figures in the world.\\n\\nThe next chapel, at the end of the transept, was once enriched by\\nGiotto frescoes, but they no longer exist. There are, however, an\\ninteresting but restored series of scenes in the life of the Virgin\\nby Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's godson; a Madonna ascending to heaven,\\nby Mainardi, who was Ghirlandaio's pupil, and so satisfactory a one\\nthat he was rewarded by the hand of his master's sister; and a pretty\\npiece of Gothic sculpture with the Christ Child upon it. Hereabouts,\\nI may remark, we have continually to be walking over floor-tombs,\\nnow ruined beyond hope, their ruin being perhaps the cause of a\\nprotecting rail being placed round the others; although a floor-tomb\\nshould have, I think, a little wearing from the feet of worshippers,\\njust to soften the lines. Those at the Certosa are, for example,\\nfar too sharp and clean.\\n\\nLet us complete the round of the church before we examine the sacristy,\\nand go now to the two chapels, where Giotto may be found at his best,\\nalthough restored too, on this side of the high altar. The Peruzzi\\nchapel has scenes from the lives of the two S. Johns, the Baptist,\\nand the Evangelist: all rather too thoroughly re-painted, although\\nfollowing Giotto's groundwork closely enough to retain much of\\ntheir interest and value. And here once again one should consult the\\n\\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" where the wilful discerning enthusiast is,\\nlike his revered subject, also at his best. Giotto's thoughtfulness\\ncould not be better illustrated than in S. Croce. One sees him, as\\never, thinking of everything: not a very remarkable attribute of the\\nfresco painter since then, but very remarkable then, when any kind of\\nfacile saintliness sufficed. Signor Bianchi, who found these paintings\\nunder the whitewash in 1853, and restored them, overdid his part,\\nthere is no doubt; but as I have said, their interest is unharmed,\\nand it is that which one so delights in. Look, for instance, at the\\nattitude of Drusiana, suddenly twitched by S. John back again into\\nthis vale of tears, while her bier is on its way to the cemetery\\noutside the pretty city. \\\"Am I really to live again?\\\" she so plainly\\nsays to the inexorable miracle-worker. The dancing of Herodias'\\ndaughter, which offered Giotto less scope, is original too -- original\\nnot because it came so early, but because Giotto's mind was original\\nand innovating and creative. The musician is charming. The last scene\\nof all is a delightful blend of religious fervour and reality: the\\nmiraculous ascent from the tomb, through an elegant Florentine loggia,\\nto everlasting glory, in a blaze of gold, and Christ and an apostle\\nleaning out of heaven with outstretched hands to pull the saint in,\\nas into a boat. Such a Christ as that could not but be believed in.\\n\\nIn the next chapel, the Bardi, we find Giotto at work on a life of\\nS. Francis, and here again Ruskin is essential. It was a task which,\\nsince this church was the great effort of the Florentine Franciscans,\\nwould put an artist upon his mettle, and Giotto set the chosen\\nincidents before the observers with the discretion and skill of the\\ngreat biographer that he was, and not only that, but the great Assisi\\ndecorator that he was. No choice could have been better at any time\\nin the history of art. Giotto chose the following scenes, one or two\\nof which coincide with those on Benedetto da Maiano's pulpit, which\\ncame of course many years later: the \\\"Confirmation of the Rules of the\\nFranciscans,\\\" \\\"S. Francis before the Sultan and the Magi,\\\" \\\"S. Francis\\nSick and Appearing to the Bishop of Assisi,\\\" \\\"S. Francis Fleeing from\\nHis Father's House and His Reception by the Bishop of Assisi,\\\" and the\\n\\\"Death of S. Francis\\\". Giotto's Assisi frescoes, which preceded these,\\nanticipate them; but in some cases these are considered to be better,\\nalthough in others not so good. It is generally agreed that the death\\nscene is the best. Note the characteristic touch by which Giotto makes\\none of the monks at the head of the bed look up at the precise moment\\nwhen the saint dies, seeing him being received into heaven. According\\nto Vasari, one of the two monks (on the extreme left, as I suppose)\\nis Giotto's portrait of the architect of the church, Amolfo. The altar\\npicture, consisting of many more scenes in the life of S. Francis,\\nis often attributed to Cimabue, Giotto's master, but probably is by\\nanother hand. In one of these scenes the saint is found preaching\\nto what must be the most attentive birds on record. The figures on\\nthe ceiling represent Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience, which all\\nFranciscans are pledged to observe. The glass is coeval with the\\nbuilding, which has been described as the most perfect Gothic chapel\\nin existence.\\n\\nThe founder of this chapel was Ridolfo de' Bardi, whose family early\\nin the fourteenth century bade fair to become as powerful as the\\nMedici, and by the same means, their business being banking and\\nmoney-lending, in association with the founders of the adjoining\\nchapel, the Peruzzi. Ridolfo's father died in 1310, and his son,\\nwho had become a Franciscan, in 1327; and the chapel was built,\\nand Giotto probably painted the frescoes, soon after the father's\\ndeath. Both the Bardi and Peruzzi were brought low by our King Edward\\nIII, who borrowed from them money with which to fight the French,\\nat Crecy and Poitiers, and omitted to repay it.\\n\\nThe chapels in the left transept are less interesting, except perhaps\\nto students of painting in its early days. In the chapel at the end\\nwe find Donatello's wooden crucifix which led to that friendly rivalry\\non the part of Brunelleschi, the story of which is one of the best in\\nall Vasari. Donatello, having finished this wooden crucifix, and being\\nunusually satisfied with it, asked Brunelleschi's opinion, confidently\\nexpecting praise. But Brunelleschi, who was sufficiently close a friend\\nto say what he thought, replied that the type was too rough and common:\\nit was not Christ but a peasant. Christ, of course, was a peasant;\\nbut by peasant Brunelleschi meant a stupid, dull man. Donatello,\\nchagrined, had recourse to what has always been a popular retort to\\ncritics, and challenged him to make a better. Brunelleschi took it very\\nquietly: he said nothing in reply, but secretly for many months, in\\nthe intervals of his architecture, worked at his own version, and then\\none day, when it was finished, invited Donatello to dinner, stopping\\nat the Mercato Vecchio to get some eggs and other things. These he\\ngave Donatello to carry, and sent him on before him to the studio,\\nwhere the crucifix was standing unveiled. When Brunelleschi arrived he\\nfound the eggs scattered and broken on the floor and Donatello before\\nhis carving in an ecstasy of admiration. \\\"But what are we going to\\nhave for dinner?\\\" the host inquired. \\\"Dinner!\\\" said Donatello; \\\"I've\\nhad all the dinner I require. To thee it is given to carve Christs:\\nto me only peasants.\\\" No one should forget this pretty story, either\\nhere or at S. Maria Novella, where Brunelleschi's crucifix now is.\\n\\nThe flexible Siena iron grille of this end chapel dates from 1335. Note\\nits ivy border.\\n\\nOn entering the left aisle we find the tombs of Cherubini, the\\ncomposer, Raphael Morghen, the engraver, and that curious example of\\nthe Florentine universalist, whose figure we saw under the Uffizi,\\nLeon Battista Alberti (1405-1472), architect, painter, author,\\nmathematician, scholar, conversationalist, aristocrat, and friend of\\nprinces. His chief work in Florence is the Rucellai palace and the\\nfa\\u00e7ade of S. Maria Novella, but he was greater as an influence than\\ncreator, and his manuals on architecture, painting, and the study of\\nperspective helped to bring the arts to perfection. It is at Rimini\\nthat he was perhaps most wonderful. Lorenzo de' Medici greatly valued\\nhis society, and he was a leader in the Platonic Academy. But the most\\nhuman achievement to his credit is his powerful plea for using the\\nvernacular in literature, rather than concealing one's best thoughts,\\nas was fashionable before his protest, in Latin. So much for Alberti's\\nintellectual side. Physically he was remarkable too, and one of his\\naccomplishments was to jump over a man standing upright, while he was\\nalso able to throw a coin on to the highest tower, even, I suppose,\\nthe Campanile, and ride any horse, however wild. At the Bargello may\\nbe seen Alberti's portrait, on a medal designed by Pisanello. The old\\nmedals are indeed the best authority for the lineaments of the great\\nmen of the Renaissance, better far than paint. At South Kensington\\nthousands may be seen, either in the original or in reproduction.\\n\\nIn the right aisle we saw Bernardo Rossellino's tomb of Leonardo Bruni;\\nin the left is that of Bruni's successor as Secretary of State, Carlo\\nMarsuppini, by Desiderio da Settignano, which is high among the most\\nbeautiful monuments that exist. \\\"Faine, faine!\\\" says Alfred Branconi,\\nwith his black eyes dimmed; and this though he has seen it every day\\nfor years and explained its beauties in the same words. Everything\\nabout it is beautiful, as the photograph which I give in this volume\\nwill help the reader to believe: proportions, figures, and tracery;\\nbut I still consider Mino's monument to Ugo in the Badia the finest\\nFlorentine example of the gentler memorial style, as contrasted with\\nthe severe Michelangelesque manner. Mino, it must be remembered,\\nwas Desiderio's pupil, as Desiderio was Donatello's. Note how\\nDesiderio, by an inspiration, opened the leaf-work at each side of\\nthe sarcophagus and instantly the great solid mass of marble became\\nlight, almost buoyant. Never can a few strokes of the chisel have had\\nso transforming an effect. There is some doubt as to whether the boys\\nare just where the sculptor set them, and the upper ones with their\\ngarlands are thought to be a later addition; but we are never likely\\nto know. The returned visitor from Florence will like to be reminded\\nthat, as of so many others of the best Florentine sculptures, there\\nis a cast of this at South Kensington.\\n\\nThe last tomb of the highest importance in the church is that of\\nGalileo, the astronomer, who died in 1642; but it is not interesting\\nas a work of art. In the centre of the church is a floor-tomb by\\nGhiberti, with a bronze figure of a famous Franciscan, Francesco\\nSansoni da Brescia.\\n\\nNext the sacristy. Italian priests apparently have no resentment\\nagainst inquisitive foreigners who are led into their dressing-rooms\\nwhile sumptuous and significant vestments are being donned; but I must\\nconfess to feeling it for them, and if my impressions of the S. Croce\\nsacristy are meagre and confused it is because of a certain delicacy\\nthat I experienced in intruding upon their rites. For on both occasions\\nwhen I visited the sacristy there were several priests either robing\\nor disrobing. Apart from a natural disinclination to invade privacy,\\nI am so poor a Roman Catholic as to be in some doubt as to whether one\\nhas a right to be so near such a mystery at all. But I recollect that\\nin this sacristy are treasures of wood and iron -- the most beautiful\\nintarsia wainscotting I ever saw, by Giovanni di Michele, with a frieze\\nof wolves and foliage, and fourteenth-century iron gates to the little\\nchapel, pure Gothic in design, with a little rose window at the top,\\ndelicate beyond words: all which things once again turn the thoughts\\nto this wonderful Italy of the fourteenth and fifteenth century,\\nwhen not even the best was good enough for those who built churches,\\nbut something miraculous was demanded from every craftsman.\\n\\nAt the end of the passage in which the sacristy is situated is the\\nexquisite little Cappella Medici, which Michelozzo, the architect of\\nS. Marco and the Palazzo Medici, and for a while Donatello's partner,\\nbuilt for his friend Cosimo de' Medici, who though a Dominican in his\\ncell at S. Marco was a Franciscan here, but by being equally a patron\\ndissociated himself from partisanship. Three treasures in particular\\ndoes this little temple hold: Giotto's \\\"Coronation of the Virgin\\\"; the\\ndella Robbia altar relief, and Mino da Fiesole's tabernacle. Giotto's\\npicture, which is signed, once stood as altar-piece in the Baroncelli\\nchapel of the church proper. In addition to the beautiful della\\nRobbia altar-piece, so happy and holy -- which Alfred Branconi boldly\\ncalls Luca -- there is over the door Christ between two angels,\\na lovely example of the same art. For a subtler, more modern and\\nless religious mind, we have but to turn to the tabernacle by Mino,\\nevery inch of which is exquisite.\\n\\nOn the same wall is a curious thing. In the eighteen-sixties died\\na Signor Lombardi, who owned certain reliefs which he believed to\\nbe Donatello's. When his monument was made these ancient works were\\nbuilt into them and here and there gilded (for it is a wicked world\\nand there was no taste at that time). One's impulse is not to look\\nat this encroaching piece of novelty at all; but one should resist\\nthat feeling, because, on examination, the Madonna and Children above\\nSignor Lombardi's head become exceedingly interesting. Her hands are\\nthe work of a great artist, and they are really holding the Child. Why\\nthis should not be an early Donatello I do not see.\\n\\nThe cloisters of S. Croce are entered from the piazza, just to the\\nright of the church: the first, a little ornate, by Arnolfo, and\\nthe second, until recently used as a barracks but now being restored\\nto a more pacific end, by Brunelleschi, and among the most perfect\\nof his works. Brunelleschi is also the designer of the Pazzi chapel\\nin the first cloisters. The severity of the fa\\u00e7ade is delightfully\\nsoftened and enlivened by a frieze of mischievous cherubs' heads, the\\njoint work of Donatello and Desiderio. Donatello's are on the right,\\nand one sees at once that his was the bolder, stronger hand. Look\\nparticularly at the laughing head fourth from the right. But that one\\nof Desiderio's over the middle columns has much charm and power. The\\ndoors, from Brunelleschi's own hand, in a doorway perfect in scale,\\nare noble and worthy. The chapel itself I find too severe and a little\\nfretted by its della Robbias and the multiplicity of circles. It is\\ncalled Brunelleschi's masterpiece, but I prefer both the Badia of\\nFiesole and the Old Sacristy at S. Lorenzo, and I remember with more\\npleasure the beautiful doorway leading from the Arnolfo cloisters\\nto the Brunelleschi cloisters, which probably is his too. The\\ndella Robbia reliefs, once one can forgive them for being here, are\\nworth study. Nothing could be more charming (or less conducive to a\\nmethodical literary morning) than the angel who holds S. Matthew's\\nink-pot. But I think my favourite of all is the pensive apostle who\\nleans his cheek on his hand and his elbow on his book. This figure\\nalone proves what a sculptor Luca was, apart altogether from the\\ncharm of his mind and the fascination of his chosen medium.\\n\\nThis chapel was once the scene of a gruesome ceremony. Old Jacopo\\nPazzi, the head of the family at the time of the Pazzi conspiracy\\nagainst the Medici, after being hanged from a window of the Palazzo\\nVecchio, was buried here. Some short while afterwards Florence was\\ninundated by rain to such an extent that the vengeance of God was\\ninferred, and, casting about for a reason, the Florentines decided\\nthat it was because Jacopo had been allowed to rest in sacred soil. A\\nmob therefore rushed to S. Croce, broke open his tomb and dragged\\nhis body through the streets, stopping on their way at the Pazzi\\npalace to knock on the door with his skull. He was then thrown into\\nthe swollen Arno and borne away by the tide.\\n\\nIn the old refectory of the convent are now a number of pictures\\nand fragments of sculpture. The \\\"Last Supper,\\\" by Taddeo Gaddi, on\\nthe wall, is notable for depicting Judas, who had no shrift at the\\nhands of the painters, without a halo. Castagno and Ghirlandaio,\\nas we shall see, under similar circumstances, placed him on the\\nwrong side of the table. In either case, but particularly perhaps in\\nTaddeo's picture, the answer to Christ's question, which Leonardo at\\nMilan makes so dramatic, is a foregone conclusion. The \\\"Crucifixion\\\"\\non the end wall, at the left, is interesting as having been painted\\nfor the Porta S. Gallo (in the Piazza Cavour) and removed here. All\\nthe gates of Florence had religious frescoes in them, some of which\\nstill remain. The great bronze bishop is said to be by Donatello and\\nto have been meant for Or San Michele; but one does not much mind.\\n\\nOne finds occasion to say so many hard things of the Florentine\\ndisregard of ancient art that it is peculiarly a pleasure to see\\nthe progress that is being made in restoring Brunelleschi's perfect\\ncloisters at S. Croce to their original form. When they were turned\\ninto barracks the Loggia was walled in all round and made into a series\\nof rooms. These walls are now gradually coming away, the lovely pillars\\nbeing again isolated, the chimneys removed, and everything lightly\\nwashed. Grass has also been sown in the great central square. The\\ncrumbling of the decorative medals in the spandrels of the cloisters\\ncannot of course be restored; but one does not complain of such\\nnatural decay as that.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nThe Accademia\\n\\nMichelangelo -- The David -- The tomb of Julius -- A contrast -- Fra\\nAngelico -- The beatific painter -- Cimabue and Giotto -- Masaccio -- Gentile\\nda Fabriano -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Fra Angelico again -- Fra\\nBartolommeo -- Perugino -- Botticelli -- The \\\"Primavera\\\" -- Leonardo da Vinci\\nand Verrocchio -- Botticelli's sacred pictures -- Botticini -- Tapestries\\nof Eden.\\n\\nThe Accademia delle Belle Arti is in the Via Ricasoli, that street\\nwhich seen from the top of the Campanile is the straightest thing in\\nFlorence, running like a ruled line from the Duomo to the valley of\\nthe Mugnone. Upstairs are modern painters: but upstairs I have never\\nbeen. It is the ground-floor rooms that are so memorable, containing\\nas they do a small but very choice collection of pictures illustrating\\nthe growth of Italian art, with particular emphasis on Florentine\\nart; the best assemblage of the work of Fra Angelico that exists;\\nand a large gallery given up to Michelangelo's sculpture: originals\\nand casts. The principal magnets that draw people here, no doubt,\\nare the Fra Angelicos and Botticelli's \\\"Primavera\\\"; but in five at\\nleast of the rooms there is not an uninteresting picture, while the\\ncollection is so small that one can study it without fatigue -- no\\nlittle matter after the crowded Uffizi and Pitti.\\n\\nIt is a simple matter to choose in such a book as this the best\\nplace in which to tell something of the life-story of, say, Giotto\\nand Brunelleschi and the della Robbias; for at a certain point their\\ngenius is found concentrated -- Donatello's and the della Robbias'\\nin the Bargello and those others at the Duomo and Campanile. But\\nwith Michelangelo it is different, he is so distributed over the\\ncity -- his gigantic David here, the Medici tombs at S. Lorenzo, his\\nfortifications at S. Miniato, his tomb at S. Croce, while there remains\\nhis house as a natural focus of all his activities. I have, however,\\nchosen the Medici chapel as the spot best suited for his biography,\\nand therefore will here dwell only on the originals that are preserved\\nabout the David. The David himself, superb and confident, is the\\nfirst thing you see in entering the doors of the gallery. He stands\\nat the end, white and glorious, with his eyes steadfastly measuring\\nhis antagonist and calculating upon what will be his next move if the\\nsling misdirects the stone. Of the objection to the statue as being\\nnot representative of the Biblical figure I have said something in the\\nchapter on the Bargello, where several Davids come under review. Yet,\\nafter all that can be said against its dramatic fitness, the statue\\nremains an impressive and majestic yet strangely human thing. There\\nit is -- a sign of what a little Italian sculptor with a broken nose\\ncould fashion with his mallet and chisel from a mass of marble four\\nhundred and more years ago.\\n\\nIts history is curious. In 1501, when Michelangelo was twenty-six\\nand had just returned to Florence from Rome with a great reputation\\nas a sculptor, the joint authorities of the cathedral and the Arte\\ndella Lana offered him a huge block of marble that had been in their\\npossession for thirty-five years, having been worked upon clumsily by\\na sculptor named Baccellino and then set aside. Michelangelo was told\\nthat if he accepted it he must carve from it a David and have it done\\nin two years. He began in September, 1501, and finished in January,\\n1504, and a committee was appointed to decide upon its position,\\namong them being Leonardo da Vinci, Perugino, Lorenzo di Credi,\\nFilippino Lippi, Botticelli, and Andrea della Robbia, There were\\nthree suggested sites: the Loggia de' Lanzi; the courtyard of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, where Verrocchio's little boudoir David then stood\\n(now in the Bargello) and where his Cupid and dolphin now are; and\\nthe place where it now stands, then occupied by Donatello's Judith and\\nHolofernes. This last was finally selected, not by the committee but by\\nthe determination of Michelangelo himself, and Judith and Holofernes\\nwere moved to the Loggia de' Lanzi to their present position. The\\nDavid was set up in May, 1504, and remained there for three hundred\\nand sixty-nine years, suffering no harm from the weather but having\\nan arm broken in the Medici riots in 1527. In 1878, however, it was\\ndecided that further exposure might be injurious, and so the statue\\nwas moved here to its frigid niche and a replica in marble afterwards\\nset up in its place. Since this glorious figure is to be seen thrice\\nin Florence, he may be said to have become the second symbol of the\\ncity, next the fleur-de-lis.\\n\\nThe Tribuna del David, as the Michelangelo salon is called, has\\namong other originals several figures intended for that tomb of Pope\\nJulius II (whose portrait by Raphael we have seen at the Uffizi)\\nwhich was to be the eighth wonder of the world, and by which the last\\nyears of the sculptor's life were rendered so unhappy. The story\\nis a miserable one. Of the various component parts of the tomb,\\nfinished or unfinished, the best known is the Moses at S. Pietro\\nin Vincoli at Rome, reproduced in plaster here, in the Accademia,\\nbeneath the bronze head of its author. Various other parts are in Rome\\ntoo; others here; one or two may be at the Bargello (although some\\nauthorities give these supposed Michelangelos to Vincenzo Danti);\\nothers are in the grotto of the Boboli Gardens; and the Louvre has\\nwhat is in some respects the finest of the \\\"Prisoners\\\".\\n\\nThe first statue on the right of the entrance of the Tribuna del David\\nis a group called \\\"Genio Vittorioso\\\". Here in the old man we see rock\\nactually turned to life; in the various \\\"Prisoners\\\" near we see life\\nemerging from rock; in the David we forget the rock altogether. One\\nwonders how Michelangelo went to work. Did the shape of the block\\nof marble influence him, or did he with his mind's eye, the R\\u00f6ntgen\\nrays of genius, see the figure within it, embedded in the midst, and\\nhew and chip until it disclosed? On the back of the fourth statue on\\nthe left a monkish face has been incised: probably some visitor to the\\nstudio. After looking at these originals and casts, and remembering\\nthose other Michelangelo sculptures elsewhere in Florence -- the tombs\\nof the Medici, the Brutus and the smaller David -- turn to the bronze\\nhead over the cast of Moses and reflect upon the author of it all:\\nthe profoundly sorrowful eyes behind which so much power and ambition\\nand disappointment dwelt.\\n\\nIt is peculiarly interesting to walk out of the Michelangelo gallery\\ninto the little room containing the Fra Angelicos: to pass from a great\\nmelancholy saturnine sculptor, the victim of the caprice of princes\\ntemporal and spiritual, his eyes troubled with world knowledge and\\nworld weariness, to the child-like celebrant of the joy of simple faith\\nwho painted these gay and happy pictures. Fra Angelico -- the sweetest\\nof all the Florentine painters -- was a monk of Fiesole, whose real name\\nwas Guido Petri da Mugello, but becoming a Dominican he called himself\\nGiovanni, and now through the sanctity and happiness of his brush is\\nfor all time Beato Angelico. He was born in 1390, nearly sixty years\\nafter Giotto's death, when Chaucer was fifty, and Richard II on the\\nEnglish throne. His early years were spent in exile from Fiesole,\\nthe brothers having come into difficulties with the Archbishop,\\nbut by 1418 he was again at Fiesole, and when in 1436 Cosimo de'\\nMedici, returned from exile at Venice, set his friend Michelozzo\\nupon building the convent of S. Marco, Fra Angelico was fetched from\\nFiesole to decorate the walls. There, and here, in the Accademia, are\\nhis chief works assembled; but he worked also at Fiesole, at Cortona,\\nand at Rome, where he painted frescoes in the chapel of Nicholas V in\\nthe Vatican and where he died, aged sixty-eight, and was buried. It\\nwas while at Rome that the Pope offered him the priorship of S. Marco,\\nwhich he declined as being unworthy, but recommended Antonio, \\\"the good\\narchbishop\\\". -- That practically is his whole life. As to his character,\\nlet Vasari tell us. \\\"He would often say that whosoever practised art\\nneeded a quiet life and freedom from care, and he who occupies himself\\nwith the things of Christ ought always to be with Christ. . . . Some\\nsay that Fra Giovanni never took up his brush without first making a\\nprayer. . . . He never made a crucifix when the tears did not course\\ndown his cheeks.\\\" The one curious thing -- to me -- about Fra Angelico\\nis that he has not been canonized. If ever a son of the Church toiled\\nfor her honour and for the happiness of mankind it was he.\\n\\nThere are examples of Fra Angelico's work elsewhere in Florence;\\nthe large picture in Room I of this gallery; the large altar-piece\\nat the Uffizi, with certain others; the series of mural paintings\\nin the cells of S. Marco; and his pictures will be found not only\\nelsewhere in Florence and Italy but in the chief galleries of the\\nworld; for he was very assiduous. We have an excellent example at\\nthe National Gallery, No. 663; but this little room gives us the\\nartist and rhapsodist most completely. In looking at his pictures,\\nthree things in particular strike the mind: the skill with which he\\ncomposed them; his mastery of light; and -- and here he is unique -- the\\npleasure he must have had in painting them. All seem to have been play;\\nhe enjoyed the toil exactly as a child enjoys the labour of building\\na house with toy bricks. Nor, one feels, could he be depressed. Even\\nin his Crucifixions there is a certain underlying happiness, due\\nto his knowledge that the Crucified was to rise again and ascend to\\nHeaven and enjoy eternal felicity. Knowing this (as he did know it)\\nhow could he be wholly cast down? You see it again in the Flagellation\\nof Christ, in the series of six scenes (No. 237). The scourging is\\nalmost a festival. But best of all I like the Flight into Egypt, in\\nNo. 235. Everything here is joyous and (in spite of the terrible cause\\nof the journey) bathed in the sunny light of the age of innocence:\\nthe landscape; Joseph, younger than usual, brave and resolute and\\nundismayed by the curious turn in his fortunes; and Mary with the\\nchild in her arms, happy and pretty, seated securely on an amiable\\ndonkey that has neither bit nor bridle. It is when one looks at\\nFra Angelico that one understands how wise were the Old Masters to\\nseek their inspiration in the life of Christ. One cannot imagine Fra\\nAngelico's existence in a pagan country. Look, in No. 236, at the six\\nradiant and rapturous angels clustering above the manger. Was there\\never anything prettier? But I am not sure that I do not most covet\\nNo. 250, Christ crucified and two saints, and No. 251, the Coronation\\nof the Virgin, for their beauty of light.\\n\\nIn the photographs No. 246 -- a Deposition -- is unusually striking,\\nbut in the original, although beautiful, it is far less radiant than\\nusual with this painter. It has, however, such feeling as to make it\\nespecially memorable among the many treatments of this subject. What\\nis generally considered the most important work in this room is the\\nLast Judgment, which is certainly extraordinarily interesting, and in\\nthe hierarchy of heaven and the company of the blest Fra Angelico is\\nin a very acceptable mood. The benignant Christ Who divides the sheep\\nand the goats; the healthy ripe-lipped Saints and Fathers who assist\\nat the tribunal and have never a line of age or experience on their\\nblooming cheeks; the monks and nuns, just risen from their graves, who\\nembrace each other in the meads of paradise with such fervour -- these\\nhave much of the charm of little flowers. But in delineating the damned\\nthe painter is in strange country. It was a subject of which he knew\\nnothing, and the introduction among them of monks of the rival order\\nof S. Francis is mere party politics and a blot.\\n\\nThere are two other rooms here, but Fra Angelico spoils us for\\nthem. Four panels by another Frate, but less radiant, Lippo Lippi, are\\nremarkable, particularly the figure of the Virgin in the Annunciation;\\nand there is a curious series of scenes entitled \\\"L'Albero della\\nCroce,\\\" by an Ignoto of the fourteenth century, with a Christ crucified\\nin the midst and all Scripture in medallions around him, the tragedy of\\nAdam and Eve at the foot (mutilated by some chaste pedant) being very\\nquaint. And in Angelico's rooms there is a little, modest Annunciation\\nby one of his school -- No. 256 -- which shows what a good influence he\\nwas, and to which the eye returns and returns. Here also, on easels,\\nare two portraits of Vallombrosan monks by Fra Bartolommeo, serene,\\nand very sympathetically painted, which cause one to regret the\\ndeterioration in Italian ecclesiastic physiognomy; and Andrea del\\nSarto's two pretty angels, which one so often finds in reproduction,\\nare here too.\\n\\nLet us now enter the first room of the collection proper and begin at\\nthe very beginning of Tuscan art, for this collection is historical\\nand not fortuitous like that of the Pitti. The student may here trace\\nthe progress of Tuscan painting from the level to the highest peaks\\nand downwards again. The Accademia was established with this purpose\\nby that enlightened prince, Peter Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany,\\nin 1784. Other pictures not wholly within his scheme have been added\\nsince, together with the Michelangelo statues and casts; but they do\\nnot impair the original idea. For the serious student the first room\\nis of far the most importance, for there he may begin with Cimabue\\n(? 1240-? 1302), and Giotto (1267-? 1337), and pass steadily to Luca\\nSignorelli (? 1450-1523). For the most part the pictures in this room\\nappeal to the inquirer rather than the sightseer; but there is not\\none that is without interest, while three works of extraordinary charm\\nhave thoughtfully been enisled, on screens, for special attention -- a\\nFra Angelico, a Fabriano, and a Ghirlandaio. Before reaching these,\\nlet us look at the walls.\\n\\nThe first large picture, on the left, the Cimabue, marks the transition\\nfrom Byzantine art to Italian art. Giovanni Cimabue, who was to be\\nthe forerunner of the new art, was born about 1240. At that time\\nthere was plenty of painting in Italy, but it was Greek, the work of\\nartists at Constantinople (Byzantium), the centre of Christianity in\\nthe eastern half of the Roman Empire and the fount of ecclesiastical\\nenergy, and it was crude workmanship, existing purely as an accessory\\nof worship. Cimabue, of whom, I may say, almost nothing definite\\nis known, and upon whom the delightful but casual old Vasari is the\\nearliest authority, as Dante was his first eulogist, carried on the\\nByzantine tradition, but breathed a little life into it. In his picture\\nhere we see him feeling his way from the unemotional painted symbols\\nof the Faith to humanity itself. One can understand this large panel\\nbeing carried (as we know the similar one at S. Maria Novella was)\\nin procession and worshipped, but it is nearer to the icon of the\\nRussian peasant of today than to a Raphael. The Madonna is above\\nlife; the Child is a little man. This was painted, say, in 1280,\\nas an altar-piece for the Badia of S. Trinit\\u00e0 at Florence.\\n\\nNext came Giotto, Cimabue's pupil, born about 1267, whom we have\\nmet already as an architect, philosopher, and innovator; and in the\\nsecond picture in this room, from Giotto's brush, we see life really\\nawakening. The Madonna is vivifying; the Child is nearer childhood; we\\ncan believe that here are veins with blood in them. Moreover, whereas\\nCimabue's angels brought masonry, these bring flowers. It is crude,\\nno doubt, but it is enough; the new art, which was to counterfeit\\nand even extend nature, has really begun; the mystery and glory of\\npainting are assured and the door opened for Botticelli.\\n\\nBut much had to happen first, particularly the mastery of the laws of\\nperspective, and it was not (as we have seen) until Ghiberti had got\\nto work on his first doors, and Brunelleschi was studying architecture\\nand Uccello sitting up all night at his desk, that painting as we\\nknow it -- painting of men and women \\\"in the round\\\" -- could be done,\\nand it was left for a youth who was not born until Giotto had been\\ndead sixty-four years to do this first as a master -- one Tommaso\\ndi Ser Giovanni Guido da Castel San Giovanni, known as Masaccio,\\nor Big Tom. The three great names then in the evolution of Italian\\npainting, a subject to which I return in chapter XXV, on the Carmine,\\nare Cimabue, Giotto, Masaccio.\\n\\nWe pass on at the Accademia from Cimabue's pupil Giotto, to Giotto's\\nfollowers, Taddeo Gaddi and Bernardo Daddi, and Daddi's follower\\nSpinello Aretino, and the long dependent and interdependent line of\\npainters. For the most part they painted altar-pieces, these early\\ncraftsmen, the Church being the principal patron of art. These\\nworks are many of them faded and so elementary as to have but an\\nantiquarian interest; but think of the excitement in those days when\\nthe picture was at last ready, and, gay in its gold, was erected in the\\nchapel! Among the purely ecclesiastical works No. 137, an Annunciation\\nby Giovanni del Biondo (second half of the fourteenth century),\\nis light and cheerful, and No. 142, the Crowning of the Virgin, by\\nRosello di Jacopo Franchi (1376-1456), has some delightful details and\\nis everywhere joyous, with a charming green pattern in it. The wedding\\nscenes in No. 147 give us Florentine life on the mundane side with\\nsome valuable thoroughness, and the Pietro Lorenzetti above -- scenes\\nin the life of S. Umilita -- is very quaint and cheery and was painted\\nas early as 1316. The little Virgin adoring, No. 160, in the corner,\\nby the fertile Ignoto, is charmingly pretty.\\n\\nAnd now for the three screens, notable among the screens of the\\ngalleries of Europe as holding three of the happiest pictures\\never painted. The first is the Adoration of the Magi, by Gentile\\nda Fabriano, an artist of whom one sees too little. His full\\nname was Gentile di Niccol\\u00f2 di Giovanni Massi, and he was born\\nat Fabriano between 1360 and 1370, some twenty years before Fra\\nAngelico. According to Vasari he was Fra Angelico's master, but\\nthat is now considered doubtful, and yet the three little scenes\\nfrom the life of Christ in the predella of this picture are nearer\\nFra Angelico in spirit and charm than any, not by a follower, that I\\nhave seen. Gentile did much work at Venice before he came to Florence,\\nin 1422, and this picture, which is considered his masterpiece, was\\npainted in 1423 for S. Trinita. He died four years later. Gentile\\nwas charming rather than great, and to this work might be applied\\nRuskin's sarcastic description of poor Ghirlandaio's frescoes, that\\nthey are mere goldsmith's work; and yet it is much more, for it has\\ngaiety and sweetness and the nice thoughtfulness that made the Child a\\nreal child, interested like a child in the bald head of the kneeling\\nmage; while the predella is not to be excelled in its modest, tender\\nbeauty by any in Florence; and predellas, I may remark again, should\\nnever be overlooked, strong as the tendency is to miss them. Many\\na painter has failed in the large space or made only a perfunctory\\nsuccess, but in the small has achieved real feeling. Gentile's Holy\\nFamily on its way to Egypt is never to be forgotten. Not so radiant\\nas Fra Angelico's, in the room we have visited out of due course,\\nbut as charming in its own manner -- both in personages and landscape;\\nwhile the city to which Joseph leads the donkey (again without reins)\\nis the most perfect thing out of fairyland.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's picture, which is the neighbour of Gentile's, is as\\na whole nearer life and one of his most attractive works. It is,\\nI think, excelled only by his very similar Adoration of the Magi\\nat the Spedale degli Innocenti, which, however, it is difficult to\\nsee; and it is far beyond the examples at the Uffizi, which are too\\nhot. Of the life of this artist, who was Michelangelo's master, I\\nshall speak in the chapter on S. Maria Novella. This picture, which\\nrepresents the Adoration of the Shepherds, was painted in 1485, when\\nthe artist was thirty-six. It is essentially pleasant: a religious\\npicture on the sunny side. The Child is the soul of babyish content,\\nequally amused with its thumb and the homage it is receiving. Close\\nby is a goldfinch unafraid; in the distance is a citied valley, with\\na river winding in it; and down a neighbouring hill, on the top of\\nwhich the shepherds feed their flocks, comes the imposing procession\\nof the Magi. Joseph is more than commonly perplexed, and the disparity\\nbetween his own and his wife's age, which the old masters agreed to\\nmake considerable, is more considerable than usual.\\n\\nBoth Gentile and Ghirlandaio chose a happy subject and made it happier;\\nFra Angelico (for the third screen picture) chose a melancholy\\nsubject and made it happy, not because that was his intention, but\\nbecause he could not help it. He had only one set of colours and one\\nset of countenances, and since the colours were of the gayest and the\\ncountenances of the serenest, the result was bound to be peaceful and\\nglad. This picture is a large \\\"Deposizione della Croce,\\\" an altar-piece\\nfor S. Trinit\\u00e0. There is such joy in the painting and light in the\\nsky that a child would clap his hands at it all, and not least at\\nthe vermilion of the Redeemer's blood. Fra Angelico gave thought to\\nevery touch: and his beatific holiness floods the work. Each of these\\nthree great pictures, I may add, has its original frame.\\n\\nThe room which leads from this one is much less valuable; but Fra\\nBartolommeo's Vision of S. Bernard has lately been brought to an easel\\nhere to give it character. I find this the Frate's most beautiful\\nwork. It may have details that are a little crude, and the pointed nose\\nof the Virgin is not perhaps in accordance with the best tradition,\\nwhile she is too real for an apparition; but the figure of the kneeling\\nsaint is masterly and the landscape lovely in subject and feeling. Here\\ntoo is Fra Bartolommeo's portrait of Savonarola, in which the reformer\\nis shown as personating S. Peter Martyr. The picture was not painted\\nfrom life, but from an earlier portrait. Fra Bartolommeo had some\\nreason to know what Savonarola was like, for he was his personal\\nfriend and a brother in the same convent of S. Marco, a few yards\\nfrom the Accademia, across the square. He was born in 1475 and was\\napprenticed to the painter Cosimo Rosselli; but he learned more from\\nstudying Masaccio's frescoes at the Carmine and the work of Leonardo da\\nVinci. It was in 1495 that he came under the influence of Savonarola,\\nand he was the first artist to run home and burn his studies from the\\nnude in response to the preacher's denunciations. Three years later,\\nwhen Savonarola was an object of hatred and the convent of S. Marco\\nwas besieged, the artist was with him, and he then made a vow that if\\nhe lived he would join the order; and this promise he kept, although\\nnot until Savonarola had been executed. For a while, as a monk, he\\nlaid aside the brush, but in 1506 he resumed it and painted until\\nhis death, in 1517. He was buried at S. Marco.\\n\\nIn his less regenerate days Fra Bartolommeo's greatest friend was the\\njovial Mariotto Albertinelli, whose rather theatrical Annunciation\\nhangs between a number of the monk's other portraits, all very\\ninteresting. Of Albertinelli I have spoken earlier. Before leaving,\\nlook at the tiny Ignoto next the door -- a Madonna and Child, the child\\neating a pomegranate. It is a little picture to steal.\\n\\nIn the next room are a number of the later and showy painters, such as\\nCarlo Dolci, Lorenzo Lippi, and Francesco Furini, all bold, dashing,\\nself-satisfied hands, in whom (so near the real thing) one can take\\nno interest. Nothing to steal here.\\n\\nReturning through Sala Prima we come to the Sala del Perugino and\\nare among the masters once more -- riper and richer than most of\\nthose we have already seen, for Tuscan art here reaches its finest\\nflower. Perugino is here and Botticelli, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo,\\nLuca Signorelli, Fra Lippo Lippi and Filippino Lippi. And here is a\\nMasaccio. The great Perugino Assumption has all his mellow sunset calm,\\nand never was a landscape more tenderly sympathetic. The same painter's\\nDeposition hangs next, and the custodian brings a magnifying glass\\nthat the tears on the Magdalen's cheek may be more closely observed;\\nbut the third, No. 53, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is finer,\\nand here again the landscape and light are perfect. For the rest,\\nthere is a Royal Academy Andrea and a formal Ghirlandaio.\\n\\nAnd now we come to Botticelli, who although less richly represented\\nin numbers than at the Uffizi, is for the majority of his admirers\\nmore to be sought here, by reason of the \\\"Primavera\\\" allegory,\\nwhich is the Accademia's most powerful magnet. The Botticellis are\\ndivided between two rooms, the \\\"Primavera\\\" being in the first. The\\nfirst feeling one has is how much cooler it is here than among the\\nPeruginos, and how much gayer; for not only is there the \\\"Primavera,\\\"\\nbut Fra Lippo Lippi is here too, with a company of angels helping\\nto crown the Virgin, and a very sweet, almost transparent, little\\nMadonna adoring -- No. 79 -- which one cannot forget.\\n\\nThe \\\"Primavera\\\" is not wearing too well: one sees that at once. Being\\nin tempera it cannot be cleaned, and a dulness is overlaying it; but\\nnothing can deprive the figure of Spring of her joy and movement,\\na floating type of conquering beauty and youth. The most wonderful\\nthing about this wonderful picture is that it should have been painted\\nwhen it was: that, suddenly, out of a solid phalanx of Madonnas should\\nhave stepped these radiant creatures of the joyous earth, earthy and\\njoyful. And not only that they should have so surprisingly and suddenly\\nemerged, but that after all these years this figure of Spring should\\nstill be the finest of her kind. That is the miracle! Luca Signorelli's\\nflowers at the Uffizi remain the best, but Botticelli's are very\\nthoughtful and before the grass turned black they must have been very\\nlovely; the exquisite drawing of the irises in the right-hand corner\\ncan still be traced, although the colour has gone. The effect now is\\nrather like a Chinese painting. For the history of the \\\"Primavera\\\"\\nand its signification, one must turn back to Chapter X.\\n\\nI spoke just now of Luca's flowers. There are others in his picture in\\nthis room -- botanist's flowers as distinguished from painter's flowers:\\nthe wild strawberry beautifully straggling. This picture is one of\\nthe most remarkable in all Florence to me: a Crucifixion to which\\nthe perishing of the colour has given an effect of extreme delicacy,\\nwhile the group round the cross on the distant mound has a quality for\\nwhich one usually goes to Spanish art. The Magdalen is curiously sulky\\nand human. Into the skull at the foot of the cross creeps a lizard.\\n\\nThis room has three Lippo Lippis, which is an interesting circumstance\\nwhen we remember that that dissolute brother was the greatest influence\\non Botticelli. The largest is the Coronation of the Virgin with its\\nmany lilies -- a picture which one must delight in, so happy and crowded\\nis it, but which never seems to me quite what it should be. The most\\nfascinating part of it is the figures in the two little medallions:\\ntwo perfect pieces of colour and design. The kneeling monk on the\\nright is Lippo Lippi himself. Near it is the Madonna adoring, No. 79,\\nof which I have spoken, with herself so luminous and the background\\nso dark; the other -- No. 82 -- is less remarkable. No. 81, above it,\\nis by Browning's Pacchiorotto (who worked in distemper); close by\\nis the Masaccio, which has a deep, quiet beauty; and beneath it is a\\nrichly coloured predella by Andrea del Sarto, the work of a few hours,\\nI should guess, and full of spirit and vigour. It consists of four\\nscriptural scenes which might be called the direct forerunners of\\nSir John Gilbert and the modern illustrators. Lastly we have what\\nis in many ways the most interesting picture in Florence -- No. 71,\\nthe Baptism of Christ -- for it is held by some authorities to be the\\nonly known painting by Verrocchio, whose sculptures we saw in the\\nBargello and at Or San Michele, while in one of the angels -- that\\nsurely on the left -- we are to see the hand of his pupil Leonardo da\\nVinci. Their faces are singularly sweet. Other authorities consider\\nnot only that Verrocchio painted the whole picture himself but that\\nhe painted also the Annunciation at the Uffizi to which Leonardo's\\nname is given. Be that as it may -- and we shall never know -- this\\nis a beautiful thing. According to Vasari it was the excellence\\nof Leonardo's contribution which decided Verrocchio to give up the\\nbrush. Among the thoughts of Leonardo is one which comes to mind with\\npeculiar force before this work when we know its story: \\\"Poor is the\\npupil who does not surpass his master\\\".\\n\\nThe second Sala di Botticelli has not the value of the first. It\\nhas magnificent examples of Botticelli's sacred work, but the other\\npictures are not the equal of those in the other rooms. Chief of the\\nBotticellis is No. 85, \\\"The Virgin and Child with divers Saints,\\\" in\\nwhich there are certain annoying and restless elements. One feels that\\nin the accessories -- the flooring, the curtains, and gilt -- the painter\\nwas wasting his time, while the Child is too big. Botticelli was seldom\\ntoo happy with his babies. But the face of the Saint in green and blue\\non the left is most exquisitely painted, and the Virgin has rather less\\ntroubled beauty than usual. The whole effect is not quite spiritual,\\nand the symbolism of the nails and the crown of thorns held up for\\nthe Child to see is rather too cruel and obvious. I like better the\\nsmaller picture with the same title -- No. 88 -- in which the Saints at\\neach side are wholly beautiful in Botticelli's wistful way, and the\\npainting of their heads and head-dresses is so perfect as to fill\\none with a kind of despair. But taken altogether one must consider\\nBotticelli's triumph in the Accademia to be pagan rather than sacred.\\n\\nNo. 8, called officially School of Verrocchio, and by one firm of\\nphotographers Botticini, and by another Botticelli, is a fine free\\nthing, low in colour, with a quiet landscape, and is altogether a\\ndelight. It represents Tobias and the three angels, and Raphael moves\\nnobly, although not with quite such a step as the radiant figure in a\\nsomewhat similar picture in our own National Gallery -- No. 781 -- which,\\nonce confidently given to Verrocchio, is now attributed to Botticini;\\nwhile our No. 296, which the visitor from Florence on returning to\\nLondon should hasten to examine, is no longer Verrocchio but School\\nof Verrocchio. When we think of these attributions and then look at\\nNo. 154 in the Accademia -- another Tobias and the Angel, here given\\nto Botticini -- we have a concrete object lesson in the perilous career\\nthat awaits the art expert,\\n\\nThe other pictures here are two sunny panels by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio,\\nhigh up, with nice easy colouring; No. 92, an Adoration of the\\nShepherds by Lorenzo di Credi, with a good landscape and all very\\nsweet and quiet; No. 98, a Deposition by Filippino Lippi and Perugino,\\nin collaboration, with very few signs of Filippino; and No. 90,\\na Resurrection by Raffaellino del Garbo, an uncommon painter in\\nFlorence; the whole thing a tour de force, but not important.\\n\\nAnd now let us look at the Angelicos again.\\n\\nBefore leaving the Accademia for the last time, one should glance\\nat the tapestries near the main entrance, just for fun. That one in\\nwhich Adam names the animals is so delightfully naive that it ought to\\nbe reproduced as a nursery wall-paper. The creatures pass in review\\nin four processions, and Adam must have had to be uncommonly quick\\nto make up his mind first and then rattle out their resultant names\\nin the time. The main procession is that of the larger quadrupeds,\\nheaded by the unicorn in single glory; and the moment chosen by the\\nartist is that in which the elephant, having just heard his name\\n(for the first time) and not altogether liking it, is turning towards\\nAdam in surprised remonstrance. The second procession is of reptiles,\\nled by the snail; the third, the smaller quadrupeds, led by four rats,\\nfollowed desperately close (but of course under the white flag) by two\\ncats; while the fourth -- all sorts and conditions of birds -- streams\\nthrough the air. The others in this series are all delightful, not\\nthe least being that in which God, having finished His work, takes\\nAdam's arm and flies with him over the earth to point out its merits.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nTwo Monasteries and a Procession\\n\\nThe Certosa -- A Company of Uncles -- The\\nCells -- Machiavelli -- Impruneta -- The\\ndella Robbias -- Pontassieve -- Pelago -- Milton's\\nsimile -- Vallombrosa -- S.

They can be bought in Florence itself, it is true (at a shop\\nat the corner of the Via de' Cerretani, close to the Baptistery),\\nbut the Certosa is far too interesting to miss, if one has time to\\nspare from the city's own treasures. The trams start from the Mercato\\nNuovo and come along the Via dell' Arcivescovado to the Baptistery,\\nand so to the Porta Romana and out into the hilly country. The ride\\nis dull and rather tiresome, for there is much waiting at sidings,\\nbut the expedition becomes attractive immediately the tram is\\nleft. There is then a short walk, principally up the long narrow\\napproach to the monastery gates, outside which, when I was there,\\nwas sitting a beggar at a stone table, waiting for the bowl of soup\\nto which all who ask are entitled.\\n\\nPassing within the courtyard you ring the bell on the right and enter\\nthe waiting hall, from which, in the course of time, when a sufficient\\nparty has been gathered, an elderly monk in a white robe leads you\\naway. How many monks there may be, I cannot say; but of the few of whom\\nI caught a glimpse, all were alike in the possession of white beards,\\nand all suggested uncles in fancy dress. Ours spoke good French and\\nwas clearly a man of parts. Lulled by his soothing descriptions I\\npassed in a kind of dream through this ancient abode of peace.\\n\\nThe Certosa dates from 1341 and was built and endowed by a wealthy\\nmerchant named Niccolo Acciaioli, after whom the Lungarno Acciaioli\\nis named. The members of the family are still buried here, certain\\nof the tombstones bearing dates of the present century. To-day it is\\nlittle but a show place, the cells of the monks being mostly empty and\\nthe sale of the liqueur its principal reason for existence. But the\\nmonks who are left take a pride in their church, which is attributed\\nto Orcagna, and its possessions, among which come first the relief\\nmonuments of early Acciaioli in the floor of one of the chapels -- the\\nfounder's being perhaps also the work of Orcagna, while that of his son\\nLorenzo, who died in 1353, is attributed by our cicerone to Donatello,\\nbut by others to an unknown hand. It is certainly very beautiful. These\\ntombs are the very reverse of those which we saw in S. Croce; for\\nthose bear the obliterating traces of centuries of footsteps, so that\\nsome are nearly flat with the stones, whereas these have been railed\\noff for ever and have lost nothing. The other famous Certosa tomb is\\nthat of Cardinal Angelo Acciaioli, which, once given to Donatello,\\nis now sometimes attributed to Giuliano di Sangallo and sometimes to\\nhis son Francesco.\\n\\nThe Certosa has a few good pictures, but it is as a monastery that\\nit is most interesting: as one of the myriad lonely convents of\\nItaly, which one sees so constantly from the train, perched among\\nthe Apennines, and did not expect ever to enter. The cloisters\\nwhich surround the garden, in the centre of which is a well, and\\nbeneath which is the distillery, are very memorable, not only for\\ntheir beauty but for the sixty and more medallions of saints and\\nevangelists all round it by Giovanni della Robbia. Here the monks\\nhave sunned themselves, and here been buried, these five and a half\\ncenturies. One suite of rooms is shown, with its own little private\\ngarden and no striking discomfort except the hole in the wall by\\nthe bed, through which the sleeper is awakened. From its balcony one\\nsees the Etna far below and hears the roar of a weir, and away in the\\ndistance is Florence with the Duomo and a third of Giotto's Campanile\\nvisible above the intervening hills.\\n\\nHaving shown you all the sights the monk leads you again to the\\nentrance hall and bids you good-bye, with murmurs of surprise and\\na hint of reproach on discovering a coin in his hand, for which,\\nhowever, none the less, he manages in the recesses of his robe to\\nfind a place; and you are then directed to the room where the liqueur,\\ntogether with sweets and picture post-cards, is sold by another monk,\\nassisted by a lay attendant, and the visit to the Certosa is over.\\n\\nThe tram that passes the Certosa continues to S. Casciano in the\\nChianti district (but much wine is called Chianti that never came\\nfrom here), where there is a point of interest in the house to which\\nMachiavelli retired in 1512, to give himself to literature and to live\\nthat wonderful double life -- a peasant loafer by day in the fields and\\nthe village inn, and at night, dressed in his noblest clothes, the\\ncold, sagacious mentor of the rulers of mankind. But at S. Casciano\\nI did not stop.\\n\\nAnd farther still one comes to the village of Impruneta, after climbing\\nhigher and higher, with lovely calm valleys on either side coloured\\nby silver olive groves and vivid wheat and maize, and studded with\\nwhite villas and villages and church towers. On the road every woman\\nin every doorway plaits straw with rapid fingers just as if we were in\\nBedfordshire. Impruneta is famous for its new terra-cotta vessels and\\nits ancient della Robbias. For in the church is some of Luca's most\\nexquisite work -- an altarpiece with a frieze of aerial angels under it,\\nand a stately white saint on either side, and the loveliest decorated\\ncolumns imaginable; while in an adjoining chapel is a Christ crucified\\nmourned by the most dignified and melancholy of Magdalens. Andrea della\\nRobbia is here too, and here also is a richly designed cantoria by Mino\\nda Fiesole. The village is not in the regular programme of visitors,\\nand Baedeker ignores it; hence perhaps the excitement which an arrival\\nfrom Florence causes, for the children turn out in battalions. The\\nchurch is very dirty, and so indeed is everything else; but no amount\\nof grime can disguise the charm of the cloisters.\\n\\nThe Certosa is a mere half-hour from Florence, Impruneta an hour\\nand a half; but Vallombrosa asks a long day. One can go by rail,\\nchanging at Sant' Ellero into the expensive rack-and-pinion car which\\nclimbs through the vineyards to a point near the summit, and has,\\nsince it was opened, brought to the mountain so many new residents,\\nwhose little villas cling to the western slopes among the lizards,\\nand, in summer, are smitten unbearably by the sun. But the best way\\nto visit the monastery and the groves is by road. A motor-car no\\ndoubt makes little of the journey; but a carriage and pair such as I\\nchartered at Florence for forty-five lire has to be away before seven,\\nand, allowing three hours on the top, is not back again until the\\nsame hour in the evening; and this, the ancient way, with the beat\\nof eight hoofs in one's ears, is the right way.\\n\\nFor several miles the road and the river -- the Arno -- run side by\\nside -- and the railway close by too -- through venerable villages whose\\ninhabitants derive their living either from the soil or the water,\\nand amid vineyards all the time. Here and there a white villa is seen,\\nbut for the most part this is peasants' district: one such villa\\non the left, before Pontassieve, having about it, and on each side\\nof its drive, such cypresses as one seldom sees and only Gozzoli or\\nMr. Sargent could rightly paint, each in his own style. Not far beyond,\\nin a scrap of meadow by the road, sat a girl knitting in the morning\\nsun -- with a placid glance at us as we rattled by; and ten hours later,\\nwhen we rattled past again, there she still was, still knitting, in\\nthe evening sun, and again her quiet eyes were just raised and dropped.\\n\\nAt Pontassieve we stopped a while for coffee at an inn at the corner\\nof the square of pollarded limes, and while it was preparing watched\\nthe little crumbling town at work, particularly the cooper opposite,\\nwho was finishing a massive cask within whose recesses good Chianti\\nis doubtless now maturing; and then on the white road again, to the\\nturning, a mile farther on, to the left, where one bids the Arno\\nfarewell till the late afternoon. Steady climbing now, and then a\\nturn to the right and we see Pelago before us, perched on its crags,\\nand by and by come to it -- a tiny town, with a clean and alluring\\ninn, very different from the squalor of Pontassieve: famous in art\\nand particularly Florentine art as being the birthplace of Lorenzo\\nGhiberti, who made the Baptistery doors. From Pelago the road descends\\nwith extreme steepness to a brook in a rocky valley, at a bridge over\\nwhich the real climb begins, to go steadily on (save for another swift\\ndrop before Tosi) until Vallombrosa is reached, winding through woods\\nall the way, chiefly chestnut -- those woods which gave Milton, who was\\nhere in 1638, his famous simile. The heat was now becoming intense\\n(it was mid-September) and the horses were suffering, and most of this\\nlast stage was done at walking pace; but such was the exhilaration of\\nthe air, such the delight of the aromas which the breeze continually\\nwafted from the woods, now sweet, now pungent, and always refreshing,\\nthat one felt no fatigue even though walking too. And so at last the\\nmonastery, and what was at that moment better than anything, lunch.\\n\\nThe beauty and joy of Vallombrosa, I may say at once, are Nature's,\\nnot man's. The monastery, which is now a Government school of\\nforestry, is ugly and unkempt; the hotel is unattractive; the few\\npeople one meets want to sell something or take you for a drive. But\\nin an instant in any direction one can be in the woods -- and at this\\nlevel they are pine woods, soft underfoot and richly perfumed -- and\\na quarter of an hour's walking brings the view. It is then that you\\nrealize you are on a mountain indeed. Florence is to the north-west\\nin the long Arno valley, which is here precipitous and narrow. The\\nriver is far below -- if you slipped you would slide into it -- fed by\\ntumbling Apennine streams from both walls. The top of the mountain\\nis heathery like Scotland, and open; but not long will it be so,\\nfor everywhere are the fenced parallelograms which indicate that a\\nvilla is to be erected. Nothing, however, can change the mountain\\nair or the glory of the surrounding heights.\\n\\nAnother view, unbroken by villas but including the monastery and the\\nForesters' Hotel in the immediate foreground, and extending as far as\\nFlorence itself (on suitable days), is obtained from Il Paradisino,\\na white building on a ledge which one sees from the hotel above the\\nmonastery. But that is not by any means the top. The view covers much\\nof the way by which we came hither.\\n\\nOf the monastery of Vallombrosa we have had foreshadowings in\\nFlorence. We saw at the Accademia two exquisite portraits by Fra\\nBartolommeo of Vallombrosan monks. We saw at the Bargello the remains\\nof a wonderful frieze by Benedetto da Rovezzano for the tomb of\\nthe founder of the order, S. Giovanni Gualberto; we shall see at\\nS. Miniato scenes in the saint's life on the site of the ancient\\nchapel where the crucifix bent and blessed him. As the head of the\\nmonastery Gualberto was famous for the severity and thoroughness of\\nhis discipline. But though a martinet as an abbot, personally he was\\nhumble and mild. His advice on all kinds of matters is said to have\\nbeen invited even by kings and popes. He invented the system of lay\\nbrothers to help with the domestic work of the convent; and after a\\nlife of holiness, which comprised several miracles, he died in 1073\\nand was subsequently canonized.\\n\\nThe monastery, as I have said, is now secularized, save for the chapel,\\nwhere three resident monks perform service. One may wander through its\\nrooms and see in the refectory, beneath portraits of famous brothers,\\nthe tables now laid for young foresters. The museum of forestry is\\ninteresting to those interested in museums of forestry.\\n\\nIt was to the monastery at Vallombrosa that the Brownings travelled\\nin 1848 when Mrs. Browning was ill. But the abbot could not break the\\nrules in regard to women, and after five days they had to return to\\nFlorence. Browning used to play the organ in the chapel, as, it is\\nsaid, Milton had done two centuries earlier.\\n\\nAt such a height and with only a short season the hotel proprietors\\nmust do what they can, and prices do not rule low. A departing American\\nwas eyeing his bill with a rueful glance as we were leaving. \\\"Milton\\nhad it wrong,\\\" he said to me (with the freemasonry of the plucked,\\nfor I knew him not), \\\"what he meant was, 'thick as thieves'.\\\"\\n\\nWe returned by way of Sant' Ellero, the gallant horses trotting\\nsteadily down the hill, and then beside the Arno once more all the\\nway to Florence. It chanced to be a great day in the city -- September\\n20th, the anniversary of the final defeat of papal temporal power,\\nin 1870 -- which we were not sorry to have missed, the first tidings\\ncoming to us from the beautiful tower of the Palazzo Vecchio which\\nin honour of the occasion had been picked out with fairy lamps.\\n\\nAmong the excursions which I think ought to be made if one is in\\nFlorence for a justifying length of time is a visit to Prato. This\\nancient town one should see for several things: for its age and for\\nits walls; for its great piazza (with a pile of vividly dyed yarn\\nin the midst) surrounded by arches under which coppersmiths hammer\\nall day at shining rotund vessels, while their wives plait straw;\\nfor Filippino Lippi's exquisite Madonna in a little mural shrine at\\nthe narrow end of the piazza, which a woman (fetched by a crowd of\\nragged boys) will unlock for threepence; and for the cathedral, with\\nFilippino's dissolute father's frescoes in it, the Salome being one\\nof the most interesting pre-Botticelli scenes in Italian art. If only\\nit had its colour what a wonder of lightness and beauty this still\\nwould be! But probably most people are attracted to Prato chiefly by\\nDonatello and Michelozzo's outdoor pulpit, the frieze of which is a\\nkind of prentice work for the famous cantoria in the museum of the\\ncathedral at Florence, with just such wanton boys dancing round it.\\n\\nOn Good Friday evening in the lovely dying April light I paid\\nthirty centimes to be taken by tram to Grassina to see the famous\\nprocession of the Ges\\u00f9 Morto. The number of people on the same\\nerrand having thrown out the tram service, we had very long waits,\\nwhile the road was thronged with other vehicles; and the result was\\nI was tired enough -- having been standing all the way -- when Grassina\\nwas reached, for festivals six miles out of Florence at seven in the\\nevening disarrange good habits. But a few pence spent in the albergo\\non bread and cheese and wine soon restored me. A queer cavern of a\\nplace, this inn, with rough tables, rows and rows of wine flasks,\\nand an open fire behind the bar, tended by an old woman, from which\\neverything good to eat proceeded rapidly without dismay -- roast chicken\\nand fish in particular. A strapping girl with high cheek bones and a\\nbroad dark comely face washed plates and glasses assiduously, and two\\nwaiters, with eyes as near together as monkeys', served the customers\\nwith bewildering intelligence. It was the sort of inn that in England\\nwould throw up its hands if you asked even for cold beef.\\n\\nThe piazza of Grassina, which, although merely a village, is\\nenterprising enough to have a cinematoscope hall, was full of\\nstalls given chiefly to the preparation and sale of cake like the\\nDutch wafelen, and among the stalls were conjurors, cheap-jacks,\\nsingers, and dice throwers; while every moment brought its fresh\\nmotor-car or carriage load, nearly all speaking English with a nasal\\ntwang. Meanwhile every one shouted, the naphtha flared, the drums beat,\\nthe horses champed. The street was full too, chiefly of peasants,\\nbut among them myriad resolute American virgins, in motor veils, whom\\nnothing can ever surprise; a few American men, sceptical, as ever,\\nof anything ever happening; here and there a diffident Englishwoman\\nand Englishman, more in the background, but destined in the end\\nto see all. But what I chiefly noticed was the native girls, with\\ntheir proud bosoms carried high and nothing on their heads. They at\\nany rate know their own future. No rushing over the globe for them,\\nbut the simple natural home life and children.\\n\\nIn the gloom the younger girls in white muslin were like pretty\\nghosts, each followed by a solicitous mother giving a touch here\\nand a touch there -- mothers who once wore muslin too, will wear it no\\nmore, and are now happy in pride in their daughters. And very little\\ngirls too -- mere tots -- wearing wings, who very soon were to join the\\nprocession as angels.\\n\\nAnd all the while the darkness was growing, and on the hill where the\\nchurch stands lights were beginning to move about, in that mysterious\\nway which torches have when a procession is being mobilized, while\\nall the villas on the hills around had their rows of candles.\\n\\nAnd then the shifting flames came gradually into a mass and took\\na steady upward progress, and the melancholy strains of an ancient\\necclesiastical lamentation reached our listening ears. As the lights\\ndrew nearer I left the bank where all the Mamies and Sadies with\\ntheir Mommas were stationed and walked down into the river valley\\nto meet the vanguard. On the bridge I found a little band of Roman\\nsoldiers on horseback, without stirrups, and had a few words with\\none of them as to his anachronistic cigarette, and then the first\\ntorches arrived, carried by proud little boys in red; and after the\\ntorches the little girls in muslin veils, which were, however, for\\nthe most part disarranged for the better recognition of relations\\nand even more perhaps for recognition by relations: and very pretty\\nthis recognition was on both sides. And then the village priests in\\nfull canonicals, looking a little self-conscious; and after them the\\ndead Christ on a litter carried by a dozen contadini who had a good\\ndeal to say to each other as they bore Him.\\n\\nThis was the same dead Christ which had been lying in state in the\\nchurch, for the past few days, to be worshipped and kissed by the\\npeasantry. I had seen a similar image at Settignano the day before and\\nhad watched how the men took it. They began by standing in groups in\\nthe piazza, gossipping. Then two or three would break away and make\\nfor the church. There, all among the women and children, half-shyly,\\nhalf-defiantly, they pecked at the plaster flesh and returned to resume\\nthe conversation in the piazza with a new serenity and confidence in\\ntheir hearts.\\n\\nAfter the dead Christ came a triumphal car of the very little girls\\nwith wings, signifying I know not what, but intensely satisfying to\\nthe onlookers. One little wet-nosed cherub I patted, so chubby and\\ninnocent she was; and Heaven send that the impulse profited me! This\\ncar was drawn by an ancient white horse, amiable and tractable as a\\nsaint, but as bewildered as I as to the meaning of the whole strange\\nbusiness. After the car of angels a stalwart body of white-vestmented\\nsingers, sturdy fellows with black moustaches who had been all day\\namong the vines, or steering placid white oxen through the furrows,\\nand were now lifting their voices in a miserere. And after them the\\npainted plaster Virgin, carried as upright as possible, and then\\nmore torches and the wailing band; and after the band another guard\\nof Roman soldiers.\\n\\nSuch was the Grassina procession. It passed slowly and solemnly through\\nthe town from the hill and up the hill again; and not soon shall I\\nforget the mournfulness of the music, which nothing of tawdriness in\\nthe constituents of the procession itself could rid of impressiveness\\nand beauty. One thing is certain -- all processions, by day or night,\\nshould first descend a hill and then ascend one. All should walk to\\nmelancholy strains. Indeed, a joyful procession becomes an impossible\\nthought after this.\\n\\nAnd then I sank luxuriously into a corner seat in the waiting tram,\\nand, seeking for the return journey's thirty centimes, found that\\nduring the proceedings my purse had been stolen.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nS. Marco\\n\\nAndrea del Castagno -- \\\"The Last Supper\\\" -- The stolen Madonna -- Fra\\nAngelico's frescoes -- \\\"Little Antony\\\" -- The good archbishop -- The\\nBuonuomini -- Savonarola -- The death of Lorenzo the Magnificent -- Pope\\nAlexander VI -- The Ordeal by Fire -- The execution -- The S. Marco\\ncells -- The cloister frescoes -- Ghirlandaio's \\\"Last Supper\\\" -- Relics of\\nold Florence -- Pico and Politian -- Piero di Cosimo -- Andrea del Sarto.\\n\\nFrom the Accademia it is but a step to S. Marco, across the Piazza, but\\nit is well first to go a little beyond that in order to see a certain\\npainting which both chronologically and as an influence comes before\\na painting that we shall find in the Museo S. Marco. We therefore\\ncross the Piazza S. Marco to the Via d'Arrazzieri, which leads into\\nthe Via 27 Aprile, where at a door on the left, marked A, is an\\nancient refectory, preserved as a picture gallery: the Cenacolo di\\nS. Apollonia, all that is kept sacred of the monastery of S. Apollonia,\\nnow a military establishment. This room is important to students of\\nart in containing so much work of Andrea del Castagno (1390-1457),\\nto whom Vasari gives so black a character. The portrait frescoes are\\nfrom the Villa Pandolfini (previously Carducci), and among them are\\nBoccaccio, Petrarch, and Dante -- who is here rather less ascetic than\\nusual -- none of whom the painter could have seen. There is also a very\\ncharming little cupid carrying a huge peacock plume. But \\\"The Last\\nSupper\\\" is the glory of the room. This work, which belongs to the\\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, is interesting as a real effort at\\npsychology. Leonardo makes Judas leave his seat to ask if it is he\\nthat is meant -- that being the dramatic moment chosen by this prince\\nof painters: Castagno calls attention to Judas as an undesirable\\nmember of the little band of disciples by placing him apart, the\\nonly one on his side of the table; which was avoiding the real task,\\nsince naturally when one of the company was forced into so sinister\\na position the question would be already answered. Castagno indeed\\nrenders Judas so obviously untrustworthy as to make it a surprise\\nthat he ever was admitted among the disciples (or wished to be one)\\nat all; while Vasari blandly suggests that he is the very image of the\\npainter himself. Other positions which later artists converted into a\\nconvention may also be noted: John, for example, is reclining on the\\ntable in an ecstasy of affection and fidelity; while the Florentine\\nloggia as the scene of the meal was often reproduced later.\\n\\nAndrea del Castagno began life as a farm lad, but was educated as an\\nartist at the cost of one of the less notable Medici. He had a vigorous\\nway with his brush, as we see here and have seen elsewhere. In the\\nDuomo, for example, we saw his equestrian portrait of Niccol\\u00f2 da\\nTolentino, a companion to Uccello's Hawkwood. When the Albizzi and\\nPeruzzi intrigues which had led to the banishment of Cosimo de' Medici\\ncame to their final frustration with the triumphant return of Cosimo,\\nit was Andrea who was commissioned by the Signoria to paint for the\\noutside of the Bargello a picture of the leaders of the insurrection,\\nupside down. Vasari is less to be trusted in his dates and facts in his\\nmemoir of Andrea del Castagno than anywhere else; for he states that\\nhe commemorated the failure of the Pazzi Conspiracy (which occurred\\ntwenty years after his death), and accuses him not only of murdering\\nhis fellow-painter Domenico Veneziano but confessing to the crime;\\nthe best answer to which allegation is that Domenico survived Andrea\\nby four years.\\n\\nWe may now return to S. Marco. The convent as we now see it was\\nbuilt by Michelozzo, Donatello's friend and partner and the friend\\nalso of Cosimo de' Medici, at whose cost he worked here. Antonino,\\nthe saintly head of the monastery, having suggested to Cosimo that\\nhe should apply some of his wealth, not always too nicely obtained,\\nto the Lord, Cosimo began literally to squander money on S. Marco,\\ndividing his affection between S. Lorenzo, which he completed upon\\nthe lines laid down by his father, and this Dominican monastery,\\nwhere he even had a cell reserved for his own use, with a bedroom\\nin addition, whither he might now and again retire for spiritual\\nrefreshment and quiet.\\n\\nIt was at S. Marco that Cosimo kept the MSS. which he was constantly\\ncollecting, and which now, after curious vicissitudes, are lodged\\nin Michelangelo's library at S. Lorenzo; and on his death he left\\nthem to the monks. Cosimo's librarian was Tommaso Parenticelli, a\\nlittle busy man, who, to the general astonishment, on the death of\\nEugenius IV became Pope and took the name of Nicholas V. His energies\\nas Pontiff went rather towards learning and art than anything else: he\\nlaid the foundations of the Vatican library, on the model of Cosimo's,\\nand persuaded Fra Angelico to Rome to paint Vatican frescoes.\\n\\nThe magnets which draw every one who visits Florence to S. Marco are\\nfirst Fra Angelico, and secondly Savonarola, or first Savonarola, and\\nsecondly Fra Angelico, according as one is constituted. Fra Angelico,\\nat Cosimo's desire and cost, came from Fiesole to paint here; while\\nGirolamo Savonarola, forced to leave Ferrara during the war, entered\\nthese walls in 1482. Fra Angelico in his single crucifixion picture in\\nthe first cloisters and in his great scene of the Mount of Olives in\\nthe chapter house shows himself less incapable of depicting unhappiness\\nthan we have yet seen him; but the most memorable of the ground-floor\\nfrescoes is the symbol of hospitality over the door of the wayfarers'\\nroom, where Christ is being welcomed by two Dominicans in the way\\nthat Dominicans (as contrasted with scoundrelly Franciscans) would of\\ncourse welcome Him. In this Ospizio are three reliquaries which Fra\\nAngelico painted for S. Maria Novella, now preserved here in a glass\\ncase. They represent the Madonna della Stella, the Coronation of the\\nVirgin, and the Adoration of the Magi. All are in Angelico's happiest\\nmanner, with plenty of gold; and the predella of the Coronation is\\nthe prettiest thing possible, with its blue saints gathered about a\\nblue Mary and Joseph, who bend over the Baby.\\n\\nThe Madonna della Stella is the picture which was stolen in 1911, but\\nquickly recovered. It is part of the strange complexity of this world\\nthat it should equally contain artists such as Fra Angelico and thieves\\nsuch as those who planned and carried out this robbery: nominally\\ncustodians of the museum. To repeat one of Vasari's sentences: \\\"Some\\nsay that he never took up his brush without first making a prayer\\\"....\\n\\nThe \\\"Peter\\\" with his finger to his lips, over the sacristy, is\\nreminding the monks that that room is vowed to silence. In the chapter\\nhouse is the large Crucifixion by the same gentle hand, his greatest\\nwork in Florence, and very fine and true in character. Beneath it\\nare portraits of seventeen famous Dominicans with S. Dominic in\\nthe midst. Note the girl with the scroll in the right -- how gay and\\nlight the colouring. Upstairs, in the cells, and pre-eminently in the\\npassage, where his best known Annunciation is to be seen, Angelico is\\nat his best. In each cell is a little fresco reminding the brother\\nof the life of Christ -- and of those by Angelico it may be said that\\neach is as simple as it can be and as sweet: easy lines, easy colours,\\nwith the very spirit of holiness shining out. I think perhaps that the\\nCoronation of the Virgin in the ninth cell, reproduced in this volume,\\nis my favourite, as it is of many persons; but the Annunciation in the\\nthird, the two Maries at the Sepulchre in the eighth, and the Child\\nin the Stable in the fifth, are ever memorable too. In the cell set\\napart for Cosimo de' Medici, No. 38, which the officials point out,\\nis an Adoration of the Magi, painted there at Cosimo's express wish,\\nthat he might be reminded of the humility proper to rulers; and here\\nwe get one of the infrequent glimpses of this best and wisest of the\\nMedici, for a portrait of him adorns it, with a wrong death-date on it.\\n\\nHere also is a sensitive terra-cotta bust of S. Antonio, Cosimo's\\nfriend and another pride of the monastery: the monk who was also\\nArchbishop of Florence until his death, and whom we saw, in stone, in\\na niche under the Uffizi. His cell was the thirty-first cell, opposite\\nthe entrance. This benign old man, who has one of the kindest faces\\nof his time, which was often introduced into pictures, was appointed\\nto the see at the suggestion of Fra Angelico, to whom Pope Eugenius\\n(who consecrated the new S. Marco in 1442 and occupied Cosimo de'\\nMedici's cell on his visit) had offered it; but the painter declined\\nand put forward Antonio in his stead. Antonio Pierozzi, whose destiny\\nit was to occupy this high post, to be a confidant of Cosimo de'\\nMedici, and ultimately, in 1523, to be enrolled among the saints,\\nwas born at Florence in 1389. According to Butler, from the cradle\\n\\\"Antonino\\\" or \\\"Little Antony,\\\" as the Florentines affectionately\\ncalled him, had \\\"no inclination but to piety,\\\" and was an enemy even\\nas an infant \\\"both to sloth and to the amusements of children\\\". As\\na schoolboy his only pleasure was to read the lives of the saints,\\nconverse with pious persons or to pray. When not at home or at school\\nhe was in church, either kneeling or lying prostrate before a crucifix,\\n\\\"with a perseverance that astonished everybody\\\". S. Dominic himself,\\npreaching at Fiesole, made him a Dominican, his answers to an\\nexamination of the whole decree of Gratian being the deciding cause,\\nalthough Little Antony was then but sixteen. As a priest he was\\n\\\"never seen at the altar but bathed in tears\\\". After being prior of\\na number of convents and a counsellor of much weight in convocation,\\nhe was made Archbishop of Florence: but was so anxious to avoid the\\nhonour and responsibility that he hid in the island of Sardinia. On\\nbeing discovered he wrote a letter praying to be excused and watered it\\nwith his tears; but at last he consented and was consecrated in 1446.\\n\\nAs archbishop his life was a model of simplicity and solicitude. He\\nthought only of his duties and the well-being of the poor. His purse\\nwas open to all in need, and he \\\"often sold\\\" his single mule in order\\nto relieve some necessitous person. He gave up his garden to the growth\\nof vegetables for the poor, and kept an ungrateful leper whose sores\\nhe dressed with his own hands. He died in 1459 and was canonized in\\n1523. His body was still free from corruption in 1559, when it was\\ntranslated to the chapel in S. Marco prepared for it by the Salviati.\\n\\nBut perhaps the good Antonino's finest work was the foundation of a\\nphilanthropic society of Florentines which still carries on its good\\nwork. Antonino's sympathy lay in particular with the reduced families\\nof Florence, and it was to bring help secretly to them -- too proud to\\nbeg -- that he called for volunteers. The society was known in the city\\nas the Buonuomini (good men) of S. Martino, the little church close to\\nDante's house, behind the Badia: S. Martin being famous among saints\\nfor his impulsive yet wise generosity with his cloak.\\n\\nThe other and most famous prior of S. Marco was Savonarola. Girolamo\\nSavonarola was born of noble family at Ferrara in 1452, and after a\\nprofound education, in which he concentrated chiefly upon religion and\\nphilosophy, he entered the Dominican order at the age of twenty-two. He\\nfirst came to S. Marco at the age of thirty and preached there in\\nLent in 1482, but without attracting much notice. When, however, he\\nreturned to S. Marco seven years later it was to be instantly hailed\\nboth as a powerful preacher and reformer. His eloquent and burning\\ndeclarations were hurled both at Florence and Rome: at the apathy and\\ngreed of the Church as a whole, and at the sinfulness and luxury of\\nthis city, while Lorenzo the Magnificent, who was then at the height\\nof his influence, surrounded by accomplished and witty hedonists,\\nand happiest when adding to his collection of pictures, jewels,\\nand sculpture, in particular did the priest rebuke. Savonarola stood\\nfor the spiritual ideals and asceticism of the Baptist, Christ, and\\nS. Paul; Lorenzo, in his eyes, made only for sensuality and decadence.\\n\\nThe two men, however, recognized each other's genius, and Lorenzo,\\nwith the tolerance which was as much a mark of the first three\\nMedici rulers as its absence was notable in most of the later ones,\\nrather encouraged Savonarola in his crusade than not. He visited him\\nin the monastery and did not resent being kept waiting; and he went\\nto hear him preach. In 1492 Lorenzo died, sending for Savonarola on\\nhis death-bed, which was watched by the two closest of his scholarly\\nfriends, Pico della Mirandola and Politian. The story of what happened\\nhas been variously told. According to the account of Politian, Lorenzo\\nmet his end with fortitude, and Savonarola prayed with the dying man\\nand gave him his blessing; according to another account, Lorenzo was\\ncalled upon by Savonarola to make three undertakings before he died,\\nand, Lorenzo declining, Savonarola left him unabsolved. These promises\\nwere (1) to repent of all his sins, and in particular of the sack\\nof Volterra, of the alleged theft of public dowry funds and of the\\nimplacable punishment of the Pazzi conspirators; (2) to restore all\\nproperty of which he had become possessed by unjust means; and (3)\\nto give back to Florence her liberty. But the probabilities are in\\nfavour of Politian's account being the true one, and the later story\\na political invention.\\n\\nLorenzo dead and Piero his son so incapable, Savonarola came to his\\nown. He had long foreseen a revolution following on the death of\\nLorenzo, and in one of his most powerful sermons he had suggested\\nthat the \\\"Flagellum Dei\\\" to punish the wicked Florentines might be\\na foreign invader. When therefore in 1493 the French king Charles\\nVIII arrived in Italy with his army, Savonarola was recognized not\\nonly as a teacher but as a prophet; and when the Medici had been\\nagain banished and Charles, having asked too much, had retreated\\nfrom Florence, the Republic was remodelled with Savonarola virtually\\ncontrolling its Great Council. For a year or two his power was supreme.\\n\\nThis was the period of the Piagnoni, or Weepers. The citizens adopted\\nsober attire; a spirit as of England under the Puritans prevailed;\\nand Savonarola's eloquence so far carried away not only the populace\\nbut many persons of genius that a bonfire was lighted in the middle\\nof the Piazza della Signoria in which costly dresses, jewels, false\\nhair and studies from the nude were destroyed.\\n\\nSavonarola, meanwhile, was not only chastising and reforming Florence,\\nbut with fatal audacity was attacking with even less mincing of words\\nthe licentiousness of the Pope. As to the character of Lorenzo de'\\nMedici there can be two opinions, and indeed the historians of Florence\\nare widely divided in their estimates; but of Roderigo Borgia (Pope\\nAlexander VI) there is but one, and Savonarola held it. Savonarola\\nwas excommunicated, but refused to obey the edict. Popes, however,\\nalthough Florence had to a large extent put itself out of reach,\\nhave long arms, and gradually -- taking advantage of the city's growing\\ndiscontent with piety and tears and recurring unquiet, there being\\nstill a strong pro-Medici party, and building not a little on his\\nknowledge of the Florentine love of change -- the Pope gathered together\\nsufficient supporters of his determination to crush this too outspoken\\ncritic and humiliate his fellow-citizens.\\n\\nEvents helped the pontiff. A pro-Medici conspiracy excited the\\npopulace; a second bonfire of vanities led to rioting, for the\\nFlorentines were beginning to tire of virtue; and the preaching of a\\nFranciscan monk against Savonarola (and the gentle Fra Angelico has\\nshown us, in the Accademia, how Franciscans and Dominicans could hate\\neach other) brought matters to a head, for he challenged Savaronola\\nto an ordeal by fire in the Loggia de' Lanzi, to test which of them\\nspoke with the real voice of God. A Dominican volunteered to make the\\nessay with a Franciscan. This ceremony, anticipated with the liveliest\\neagerness by the Florentines, was at the last moment forbidden,\\nand Savonarola, who had to bear the responsibility of such a bitter\\ndisappointment to a pleasure-loving people, became an unpopular\\nfigure. Everything just then was against him, for Charles VIII,\\nwith whom he had an understanding and of whom the Pope was afraid,\\nchose that moment to die.\\n\\nThe Pope drove home his advantage, and getting more power among\\nindividuals on the Council forced them to indict their firebrand. No\\nmeans were spared, however base; forgery and false witness were as\\nnothing. The summons arrived on April 8th, 1497, when Savonarola was\\nat S. Marco. The monks, who adored him, refused to let him go, and\\nfor a whole day the convent was under siege. But might, of course,\\nprevailed, and Savonarola was dragged from the church to the Palazzo\\nVecchio and prosecuted for the offence of claiming to have supernatural\\npower and fomenting political disturbance. He was imprisoned in a tiny\\ncell in the tower for many days, and under constant torture he no doubt\\nuttered words which would never have passed his lips had he been in\\ncontrol of himself; but we may dismiss, as false, the evidence which\\nmakes them into confessions. Evidence there had to be, and evidence\\nnaturally was forthcoming; and sentence of death was passed.\\n\\nIn that cell, when not under torture, he managed to write meditations\\non the thirteenth psalm, \\\"In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped,\\\" and a little\\nwork entitled \\\"A Rule for Living a Christian Life\\\". Before the last\\nday he administered the Sacrament to his two companions, who were to\\ndie with him, with perfect composure, and the night preceding they\\nspent together in prayer in the Great Hall which he had once dominated.\\n\\nThe execution was on May 23rd, 1498. A gallows was erected in\\nthe Piazza della Signoria on the spot now marked by the bronze\\ntablet. Beneath the gallows was a bonfire. All those members of the\\nGovernment who could endure the scene were present, either on the\\nplatform of the Palazzo Vecchio or in the Loggia de' Lanzi. The crowd\\nfilled the Piazza. The three monks went to their death unafraid. When\\nhis friar's gown was taken from him, Savonarola said: \\\"Holy gown,\\nthou wert granted to me by God's grace and I have ever kept thee\\nunstained. Now I forsake thee not but am bereft of thee.\\\" (This very\\ngarment is in the glass case in Savonarola's cell at S. Marco.) The\\nBishop replied hastily: \\\"I separate thee from the Church militant\\nand triumphant\\\". \\\"Militant,\\\" replied Savonarola, \\\"not triumphant, for\\nthat rests not with you.\\\" The monks were first hanged and then burned.\\n\\nThe larger picture of the execution which hangs in Savonarola's\\ncell, although interesting and up to a point credible, is of course\\nnot right. The square must have been crowded: in fact we know it\\nwas. The picture has still other claims on the attention, for it\\nshows the Judith and Holofernes as the only statue before the Palazzo\\nVecchio, standing where David now is; it shows the old ringhiera,\\nthe Marzocco (very inaccurately drawn), and the Loggia de' Lanzi\\nempty of statuary. We have in the National Gallery a little portrait\\nof Savonarola -- No. 1301 -- with another representation of the execution\\non the back of it.\\n\\nSo far as I can understand Savonarola, his failure was due to\\ntwo causes: firstly, his fatal blending of religion and politics,\\nand secondly, the conviction which his temporary success with the\\nsusceptible Florentines bred in his heated mind that he was destined\\nto carry all before him, totally failing to appreciate the Florentine\\ncharacter with all its swift and deadly changes and love of change. As\\nI see it, Savonarola's special mission at that time was to be a\\nwandering preacher, spreading the light and exciting his listeners to\\nspiritual revival in this city and that, but never to be in a position\\nof political power and never to become rooted. The peculiar tragedy\\nof his career is that he left Florence no better than he found it:\\nindeed, very likely worse; for in a reaction from a spiritual revival\\na lower depth can be reached than if there had been no revival at all;\\nwhile the visit of the French army to Italy, for which Savonarola took\\nsuch credit to himself, merely ended in disaster for Italy, disease\\nfor Europe, and the spreading of the very Renaissance spirit which\\nhe had toiled to destroy. But, when all is said as to his tragedy,\\npersonal and political, there remains this magnificent isolated figure,\\nsingle-minded, austere and self-sacrificing, in an age of indulgence.\\n\\nFor most people \\\"Romola\\\" is the medium through which Savonarola is\\nvisualized; but there he is probably made too theatrical. Yet he\\nmust have had something of the theatre in him even to consent to the\\nordeal by fire. That he was an intense visionary is beyond doubt,\\nbut a very real man too we must believe when we read of the devotion\\nof his monks to his person, and of his success for a while with the\\nshrewd, worldly Great Council.\\n\\nSavonarola had many staunch friends among the artists. We have seen\\nLorenzo di Credi and Fra Bartolommeo under his influence. After\\nhis death Fra Bartolommeo entered S. Marco (his cell was No. 34),\\nand di Credi, who was noted for his clean living, entered S. Maria\\nNuova. Two of Luca della Robbia's nephews were also monks under\\nSavonarola. We have seen Fra Bartolommeo's portrait of Savonarola in\\nthe Accademia, and there is another of him here. Cronaca, who built\\nthe Great Council's hall, survived Savonarola only ten years, and\\nduring that time all his stories were of him. Michelangelo, who was\\na young man when he heard him preach, read his sermons to the end of\\nhis long life. But upon Botticelli his influence was most powerful,\\nfor he turned that master's hand from such pagan allegories as the\\n\\\"Primavera\\\" and the \\\"Birth of Venus\\\" wholly to religious subjects.\\n\\nSavonarola had three adjoining cells. In the first is a monument to\\nhim, his portrait by Fra Bartolommeo and three frescoes by the same\\nhand. In the next room is the glass case containing his robe, his\\nhair shirt, and rosary; and here also are his desk and some books. In\\nthe bedroom is a crucifixion by Fra Angelico on linen. No one knowing\\nSavonarola's story can remain here unmoved.\\n\\nWe find Fra Bartolommeo again with a pencil drawing of S. Antonio\\nin that saint's cell. Here also is Antonino's death-mask. The\\nterra-cotta bust of him in Cosimo's cell is the most like life, but\\nthere is an excellent and vivacious bronze in the right transept of\\nS. Maria Novella.\\n\\nBefore passing downstairs again the library should be visited, that\\ndelightful assemblage of grey pillars and arches. Without its desks\\nand cases it would be one of the most beautiful rooms in Florence. All\\nthe books have gone, save the illuminated music.\\n\\nIn the first cloisters, which are more liveable-in than the ordinary\\nFlorentine cloisters, having a great shady tree in the midst with a\\nseat round it, and flowers, are the Fra Angelicos I have mentioned. The\\nother painting is rather theatrical and poor. In the refectory is\\na large scene of the miracle of the Providenza, when S. Dominic and\\nhis companions, during a famine, were fed by two angels with bread;\\nwhile at the back S. Antonio watches the crucified Christ. The artist\\nis Sogliano.\\n\\nIn addition to Fra Angelico's great crucifixion fresco in the chapter\\nhouse, is a single Christ crucified, with a monk mourning, by Antonio\\nPollaiuolo, very like the Fra Angelico in the cloisters; but the\\ncolour has left it, and what must have been some noble cypresses are\\nnow ghosts dimly visible. The frame is superb.\\n\\nOne other painting we must see -- the \\\"Last Supper\\\" of Domenico\\nGhirlandaio. Florence has two \\\"Last Suppers\\\" by this artist -- one at\\nthe Ognissanti and this. The two works are very similar and have much\\nentertaining interest, but the debt which this owes to Castagno is very\\nobvious: it is indeed Castagno sweetened. Although psychologically this\\npicture is weak, or at any rate not strong, it is full of pleasant\\ntouches: the supper really is a supper, as it too often is not,\\nwith fruit and dishes and a generous number of flasks; the tablecloth\\nwould delight a good housekeeper; a cat sits close to Judas, his only\\ncompanion; a peacock perches in a niche; there are flowers on the wall,\\nand at the back of the charming loggia where the feast is held are\\nluxuriant trees, and fruits, and flying birds. The monks at food in\\nthis small refectory had compensation for their silence in so engaging\\na scene. This room also contains a beautiful della Robbia \\\"Deposition\\\".\\n\\nThe little refectory, which is at the foot of the stairs leading to\\nthe cells, opens on the second cloisters, and these few visitors ever\\nenter. But they are of deep interest to any one with a passion for\\nthe Florence of the great days, for it is here that the municipality\\npreserves the most remarkable relics of buildings that have had to\\nbe destroyed. It is in fact the museum of the ancient city. Here,\\nfor example, is that famous figure of Abundance, in grey stone,\\nwhich Donatello made for the old market, where the Piazza Vittorio\\nEmmanuele now is, in the midst of which she poured forth her fruits\\nfrom a cornucopia high on a column for all to see. Opposite is a\\nmagnificent doorway designed by Donatello for the Pazzi garden. Old\\nwindows, chimney-pieces, fragments of cornice, carved pillars,\\npainted beams, coats of arms, are everywhere.\\n\\nIn cell No. 3 is a pretty little coloured relief of the Virgin\\nadoring, which I covet, from a tabernacle in the old Piazza di\\nBrunelleschi. Here too are relics of the guild houses of some of\\nthe smaller Arti, while perhaps the most humanly interesting thing\\nof all is the great mournful bell of S. Marco in Savonarola's time,\\nknown as La Piagnone.\\n\\nIn the church of S. Marco lie two of the learned men, friends of\\nLorenzo de' Medici, whose talk at the Medici table was one of the\\nyouthful Michelangelo's educative influences, what time he was studying\\nin the Medici garden, close by: Angelo Poliziano (1454-1494), the\\npoet and the tutor of the three Medici boys, and the marvellous Pico\\ndella Mirandola (1463-1494), the enchanted scholar. Pico was one of the\\nmost fascinating and comely figures of his time. He was born in 1463,\\nthe son of the Count of Mirandola, and took early to scholarship,\\nspending his time among philosophies as other boys among games or\\nS. Antonio at his devotions, but by no means neglecting polished life\\ntoo, for we know him to have been handsome, accomplished, and a knight\\nin the court of Venus. In 1486 he challenged the whole world to meet\\nhim in Rome and dispute publicly upon nine hundred theses; but so\\nmany of them seemed likely to be paradoxes against the true faith,\\ntoo brilliantly defended, that the Pope forbade the contest. Pico\\ndabbled in the black arts, wrote learnedly (in his room at the Badia\\nof Fiesole) on the Mosaic law, was an amorous poet in Italian as well\\nas a serious poet in Latin, and in everything he did was interesting\\nand curious, steeped in Renaissance culture, and inspired by the wish\\nto reconcile the past and the present and humanize Christ and the\\nFathers. He found time also to travel much, and he gave most of his\\nfortune to establish a fund to provide penniless girls with marriage\\nportions. He had enough imagination to be the close friend both of\\nLorenzo de' Medici and Savonarola. Savonarola clothed his dead body\\nin Dominican robes and made him posthumously one of the order which\\nfor some time before his death he had desired to join. He died in\\n1494 at the early age of thirty-one, two years after Lorenzo.\\n\\nAngelo Poliziano, known as Politian, was also a Renaissance scholar\\nand also a friend of Lorenzo, and his companion, with Pico, at\\nhis death-bed; but although in precocity, brilliancy of gifts,\\nand literary charm he may be classed with Pico, the comparison\\nthere ends, for he was a gross sensualist of mean exterior and\\ncapable of much pettiness. He was tutor to Lorenzo's sons until\\ntheir mother interfered, holding that his views were far too loose,\\nbut while in that capacity he taught also Michelangelo and put him\\nupon the designing of his relief of the battle of the Lapithae and\\nCentaurs. At the time of Lorenzo and Giuliano's famous tournament\\nin the Piazza of S. Croce, Poliziano wrote, as I have said, the\\ndescriptive allegorical poem which gave Botticelli ideas for his\\n\\\"Birth of Venus\\\" and \\\"Primavera\\\". He lives chiefly by his Latin poems;\\nbut he did much to make the language of Tuscany a literary tongue. His\\nelegy on the death of Lorenzo has real feeling in it and proves him to\\nhave esteemed that friend and patron. Like Pico, he survived Lorenzo\\nonly two years, and he also was buried in Dominican robes. Perhaps\\nthe finest feat of Poliziano's life was his action in slamming the\\nsacristy doors in the face of Lorenzo's pursuers on that fatal day\\nin the Duomo when Giuliano de' Medici was stabbed.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's fresco in S. Trinit\\u00e0 of the granting of the charter\\nto S. Francis gives portraits both of Poliziano and Lorenzo in the\\nyear 1485. Lorenzo stands in a little group of four in the right-hand\\ncorner, holding out his hand towards Poliziano, who, with Lorenzo's\\nson Giuliano on his right and followed by two other boys, is advancing\\nup the steps. Poliziano is seen again in a Ghirlandaio fresco at\\nS. Maria Novella.\\n\\nFrom S. Marco we are going to SS. Annunziata, but first let us just\\ntake a few steps down the Via Cavour, in order to pass the Casino\\nMedici, since it is built on the site of the old Medici garden where\\nLorenzo de' Medici established Bertoldo, the sculptor, as head of a\\nschool of instruction, amid those beautiful antiques which we have\\nseen in the Uffizi, and where the boy Michelangelo was a student.\\n\\nA few steps farther on the left, towards the Fiesole heights, which\\nwe can see rising at the end of the street, we come, at No. 69, to a\\nlittle doorway which leads to a little courtyard -- the Chiostro dello\\nScalzo -- decorated with frescoes by Andrea del Sarto and Franciabigio\\nand containing the earliest work of both artists. The frescoes are in\\nmonochrome, which is very unusual, but their interest is not impaired\\nthereby: one does not miss other colours. No. 7, the Baptism of Christ,\\nis the first fresco these two associates ever did; and several years\\nelapsed between that and the best that are here, such as the group\\nrepresenting Charity and the figure of Faith, for the work was long\\ninterrupted. The boys on the staircase in the fresco which shows\\nS. John leaving his father's house are very much alive. This is by\\nFranciabigio, as is also S. John meeting with Christ, a very charming\\nscene. Andrea's best and latest is the Birth of the Baptist, which\\nhas the fine figure of Zacharias writing in it. But what he should\\nbe writing at that time and place one cannot imagine: more reasonably\\nmight he be called a physician preparing a prescription. On the wall\\nis a terra-cotta bust of S. Antonio, making him much younger than\\nis usual.\\n\\nAndrea's suave brush we find all over Florence, both in fresco and\\npicture, and this is an excellent place to say something of the man\\nof whom English people have perhaps a more intimate impression than\\nof any other of the old masters, by reason largely of Browning's\\npoem and not a little by that beautiful portrait which for so long\\nwas erroneously considered to represent the painter himself, in our\\nNational Gallery. Andrea's life was not very happy. No painter had\\nmore honour in his own day, and none had a greater number of pupils,\\nbut these stopped with him only a short time, owing to the demeanour\\ntowards them of Andrea's wife, who developed into a flirt and shrew,\\ndowered with a thousand jealousies. Andrea, the son of a tailor, was\\nborn in 1486 and apprenticed to a goldsmith. Showing, however, more\\ndrawing than designing ability, he was transferred to a painter named\\nBarile and then passed to that curious man of genius who painted the\\nfascinating picture \\\"The Death of Procris\\\" which hangs near Andrea's\\nportrait in our National Gallery -- Piero di Cosimo. Piero carried\\noddity to strange lengths. He lived alone in indescribable dirt,\\nand lived wholly on hard-boiled eggs, which he cooked, with his glue,\\nby the fifty, and ate as he felt inclined. He forbade all pruning of\\ntrees as an act of insubordination to Nature, and delighted in rain\\nbut cowered in terror from thunder and lightning. He peered curiously\\nat clouds to find strange shapes in them, and in his pursuit of the\\ngrotesque examined the spittle of sick persons on the walls or ground,\\nhoping for suggestions of monsters, combats of horses, or fantastic\\nlandscapes. But why this should have been thought madness in Cosimo\\nwhen Leonardo in his directions to artists explicitly advises them\\nto look hard at spotty walls for inspiration, I cannot say. He\\nwas also the first, to my knowledge, to don ear-caps in tedious\\nsociety -- as Herbert Spencer later used to do. He had many pupils,\\nbut latterly could not bear them in his presence and was therefore\\nbut an indifferent instructor. As a deviser of pageants he was more in\\ndemand than as a painter; but his brush was not idle. Both London and\\nParis have, I think, better examples of his genius than the Uffizi;\\nbut he is well represented at S. Spirito.\\n\\nPiero sent Andrea to the Palazzo Vecchio to study the Leonardo and\\nMichelangelo cartoons, and there he met Franciabigio, with whom\\nhe struck up one of his close friendships, and together they took a\\nstudio and began to paint for a living. Their first work together was\\nthe Baptism of Christ at which we are now looking. The next commission\\nafter the Scalzo was to decorate the courtyard of the Convent of the\\nServi, now known as the Church of the Annunciation; and moving into\\nadjacent lodgings, Andrea met Jacopo Sansovino, the Venetian sculptor,\\nwhose portrait by Bassano is in the Uffizi, a capable all-round\\nman who had studied in Rome and was in the way of helping the young\\nAndrea at all points. It was then too that he met the agreeable and\\nconvivial Rustici, of whom I have said something in the chapter on\\nthe Baptistery, and quickly became something of a blood -- for by this\\ntime, the second decade of the sixteenth century, the simplicity of\\nthe early artists had given place to dashing sophistication and the\\ngreat period was nearly over. For this change the brilliant complex\\ninquiring mind of Leonardo da Vinci was largely responsible, together\\nwith the encouragement and example of Lorenzo de' Medici and such of\\nhis cultured sceptical friends as Alberti, Pico della Mirandola, and\\nPoliziano. But that is a subject too large for this book. Enough that\\na worldly splendour and vivacity had come into artistic life and Andrea\\nwas an impressionable young man in the midst of it. It does not seem to\\nhave affected the power and dexterity of his hand, but it made him a\\nreligious court-painter instead of a religious painter. His sweetness\\nand an underlying note of pathos give his work a peculiar and genuine\\ncharacter; but he is just not of the greatest. Not so great really\\nas Luca Signorelli, for example, whom few visitors to the galleries\\nrush at with gurgling cries of rapture as they rush at Andrea.\\n\\nWhen Andrea was twenty-six he married. The lady was the widow of a\\nhatter. Andrea had long loved her, but the hatter clung outrageously\\nto life. In 1513, however, she was free, and, giving her hand to the\\npainter, his freedom passed for ever. Vasari being among Andrea's\\npupils may be trusted here, and Vasari gives her a bad character,\\nwhich Browning completes. Andrea painted her often, notably in the\\nfresco of the \\\"Nativity of the Virgin,\\\" to which we shall soon come\\nat the Annunziata: a fine statuesque woman by no means unwilling to\\nhave the most popular artist in Florence as her slave.\\n\\nOf the rest of Andrea's life I need say little. He grew steadily in\\nfavour and was always busy; he met Michelangelo and admired him, and\\nMichelangelo warned Raphael in Rome of a little fellow in Florence who\\nwould \\\"make him sweat\\\". Browning, in his monologue, makes this remark\\nof Michelangelo's, and the comparison between Andrea and Raphael that\\nfollows, the kernel of the poem.\\n\\nLike Leonardo and Rustici, Andrea accepted, in 1518, an invitation from\\nFrancis I to visit Paris and once there began to paint for that royal\\npatron. But although his wife did not love him, she wanted him back,\\nand in the midst of his success he returned, taking with him a large\\nsum of money from Francis with which to buy for the king works of\\nart in Italy. That money he misapplied to his own extravagant ends,\\nand although Francis took no punitive steps, the event cannot have\\nimproved either Andrea's position or his peace of mind; while it\\ncaused Francis to vow that he had done with Florentines. Andrea died\\nin 1531, of fever, nursed by no one, for his wife, fearing it might\\nbe the dreaded plague, kept away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nThe SS. Annunziata and the Spedale degli Innocenti\\n\\nAndrea del Sarto again -- Franciabigio outraged -- Alessio\\nBaldovinetti -- Piero de' Medici's church -- An Easter Sunday\\ncongregation -- Andrea's \\\"Madonna del Sacco\\\" -- \\\"The Statue and\\nthe Bust\\\" -- Henri IV -- The Spedale degli Innocenti -- Andrea della\\nRobbia -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Cosimo I and the Etruscans -- Bronzes and\\ntapestries -- Perugino's triptych -- S. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi -- \\\"Very\\nsacred human dust\\\".\\n\\nFrom S. Marco it is an easy step, along the Via Sapienza, to the\\nPiazza dell' Annunziata, where one finds the church of that name,\\nthe Palazzo Riccardi-Mannelli, and opposite it, gay with the famous\\ndella Robbia reliefs of swaddled children, the Spedale degli Innocenti.\\n\\nFirst the church, which is notable for possessing in its courtyard\\nAndrea del Sarto's finest frescoes. This series, of which he was the\\nchief painter, with his friend Franciabigio again as his principal\\nally, depict scenes in the life of the Virgin and S. Filippo. The\\nscene of the Birth of the Virgin has been called the triumph of\\nfresco painting, and certainly it is very gay and life-like in\\nthat medium. The whole picture very charming and easy, with the\\npleasantest colouring imaginable and pretty details, such as the\\nwashing of the baby and the boy warming his hands, while of the two\\nwomen in the foreground, that on the left, facing the spectator,\\nis a portrait of Andrea's wife, Lucrezia. In the Arrival of the\\nMagi we find Andrea himself, the figure second from the right-hand\\nside, pointing; while next to him, on the left, is his friend Jacopo\\nSansovino. The \\\"Dead Man Restored to Life by S. Filippo\\\" is Andrea's\\nnext best. Franciabigio did the scene of the Marriage of the Virgin,\\nwhich contains another of his well-drawn boys on the steps. The injury\\nto this fresco -- the disfigurement of Mary's face -- was the work of\\nthe painter himself, in a rage that the monks should have inspected\\nit before it was ready. Vasari is interesting on this work. He draws\\nattention to it as illustrating \\\"Joseph's great faith in taking her,\\nhis face expressing as much fear as joy\\\". He also says that the blow\\nwhich the man is giving Joseph was part of the marriage ceremony at\\nthat time in Florence.\\n\\nFranciabigio, in spite of his action in the matter of this fresco,\\nseems to have been a very sweet-natured man, who painted rather to be\\nable to provide for his poor relations than from any stronger inner\\nimpulse, and when he saw some works by Raphael gave up altogether,\\nas Verrocchio gave up after Leonardo matured. Franciabigio was a\\nfew years older than Andrea, but died at the same age. Possibly it\\nwas through watching his friend's domestic troubles that he remained\\nsingle, remarking that he who takes a wife endures strife. His most\\ncharming work is that \\\"Madonna of the Well\\\" in the Uffizi, which\\nis reproduced in this volume. Franciabigio's master was Mariotto\\nAlbertinelli, who had learned from Cosimo Rosselli, the teacher\\nof Piero di Cosimo, Andrea's master -- another illustration of the\\ninterdependence of Florentine artists.\\n\\nOne of the most attractive works in the courtyard must once have\\nbeen the \\\"Adoration of the Shepherds\\\" by Alessio Baldovinetti, at\\nthe left of the entrance to the church. It is badly damaged and the\\ncolour has gone, but one can see that the valley landscape, when it\\nwas painted, was a dream of gaiety and happiness.\\n\\nThe particular treasure of the church is the extremely ornate chapel\\nof the Virgin, containing a picture of the Virgin displayed once a\\nyear on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25th, in the painting\\nof which the Virgin herself took part, descending from heaven for\\nthat purpose. The artist thus divinely assisted was Pietro Cavallini,\\na pupil of Giotto. The silver shrine for the picture was designed by\\nMichelozzo and was a beautiful thing before the canopy and all the\\ndistressing accessories were added. It was made at the order of Piero\\nde' Medici, who was as fond of this church as his father Cosimo was\\nof S. Lorenzo. Michelozzo only designed it; the sculpture was done\\nby Pagno di Lapo Portigiani, whose Madonna is over the tomb of Pope\\nJohn by Donatello and Michelozzo in the Baptistery.\\n\\nAmong the altar-pieces are two by Perugino; but of Florentine\\naltar-pieces one can say little or nothing in a book of reasonable\\ndimensions. There are so many and they are for the most part so\\ndifficult to see. Now and then one arrests the eye and holds it;\\nbut for the most part they go unstudied. The rotunda of the choir\\nis interesting, for here we meet again Alberti, who completed it\\nfrom designs by Michelozzo. It does not seem to fit the church from\\nwithin, and even less so from without, but it is a fine structure. The\\nseventeenth-century painting of the dome is almost impressive.\\n\\nBut one can forget and forgive all the church's gaudiness and floridity\\nwhen the choir is in good voice and the strings play Palestrina as\\nthey did last Easter Sunday. The Annunziata is famous for its music,\\nand on the great occasions people crowd there as nowhere else. At High\\nMass the singing was fine but the instrumental music finer. One is\\naccustomed to seeing vicarious worship in Italy; but never was there\\nso vicarious a congregation as ours, and indeed if it had not been\\nfor the sight of the busy celibates at the altar one would not have\\nknown that one was worshipping at all. The culmination of detachment\\ncame when a family of Siamese or Burmese children, in native dress,\\nentered. A positive hum went round, and not an eye but was fixed\\non the little Orientals. When, however, the organ was for a while\\nsuperseded and the violas and violins quivered under the plangent\\nmelody of Palestrina, our roving attention was fixed and held.\\n\\nI am not sure that the Andrea in the cloisters is not the best of\\nall his work. It is very simple and wholly beautiful, and in spite\\nof years of ravage the colouring is still wonderful, perhaps indeed\\nbetter for the hand of Time. It is called the \\\"Madonna del Sacco\\\"\\n(grain sack), and fills the lunette over the door leading from the\\nchurch. The Madonna -- Andrea's favourite type, with the eyes set widely\\nin the flat brow over the little trustful nose -- has her Son, older than\\nusual, sprawling on her knee. Her robes are ample and rich; a cloak\\nof green is over her pretty head. By her sits S. Joseph, on the sack,\\nreading with very long sight. That is all; but one does not forget it.\\n\\nFor the rest the cloisters are a huddle of memorial slabs and\\nindifferent frescoes. In the middle is a well with nice iron work. No\\ngrass at all. The second cloisters, into which it is not easy to get,\\nhave a gaunt John the Baptist in terra-cotta by Michelozzo.\\n\\nOn leaving the church, our natural destination is the Spedale, on the\\nleft, but one should pause a moment in the doorway of the courtyard (if\\nthe beggars who are always there do not make it too difficult) to look\\ndown the Via de' Servi running straight away to the cathedral, which,\\nwith its great red warm dome, closes the street. The statue in the\\nmiddle of the piazza is that of the Grand Duke Ferdinand by Giovanni da\\nBologna, cast from metal taken from the Italians' ancient enemies the\\nTurks, while the fountains are by Tacca, Giovanni's pupil, who made\\nthe bronze boar at the Mercato Nuovo. \\\"The Synthetical Guide Book,\\\"\\nfrom which I have already quoted, warns its readers not to overlook\\n\\\"the puzzling bees\\\" at the back of Ferdinand's statue. \\\"Try to count\\nthem,\\\" it adds. (I accepted the challenge and found one hundred and\\none.) The bees have reference to Ferdinand's emblem -- a swarm of these\\ninsects, with the words \\\"Majestate tantum\\\". The statue, by the way,\\nis interesting for two other reasons than its subject. First, it is\\nthat to which Browning's poem, \\\"The Statue and the Bust,\\\" refers, and\\nwhich, according to the poet, was set here at Ferdinand's command to\\ngaze adoringly for ever at the della Robbia bust of the lady whom he\\nloved in vain. But the bust no longer is visible, if ever it was. John\\nof Douay (as Gian Bologna was also called) -- \\n\\n\\n\\nJohn of Douay shall effect my plan,\\nSet me on horseback here aloft,\\nAlive, as the crafty sculptor can,\\n\\n\\nIn the very square I have crossed so oft:\\nThat men may admire, when future suns\\nShall touch the eyes to a purpose soft,\\n\\n\\nWhile the mouth and the brow stay brave in bronze -- \\nAdmire and say, \\\"when he was alive\\nHow he would take his pleasure once!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other point of interest is that when Maria de' Medici, Ferdinand's\\nniece, wished to erect a statue of Henri IV (her late husband) at the\\nPont Neuf in Paris she asked to borrow Gian Bologna. But the sculptor\\nwas too old to go and therefore only a bronze cast of this same horse\\nwas offered. In the end Tacca completed both statues, and Henri IV\\nwas set up in 1614 (after having fallen overboard on the voyage from\\nLeghorn to Havre). The present statue at the Pont Neuf is, however,\\na modern substitute.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade of the Spedale degli Innocenti, or children's hospital, when\\nfirst seen by the visitor evokes perhaps the quickest and happiest\\ncry of recognition in all Florence by reason of its row of della\\nRobbia babies, each in its blue circle, reproductions of which have\\ngone all over the world. These are thought to be by Andrea, Luca's\\nnephew, and were added long after the building was completed. Luca\\nprobably helped him. The hospital was begun by Brunelleschi at the\\ncost of old Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo's father, but the Guild of\\nthe Silk Weavers, for whom Luca made the exquisite coat of arms on Or\\nSan Michele, took it over and finished it. Andrea not only modelled\\nthe babies outside but the beautiful Annunciation (of which I give a\\nreproduction in this volume) in the court: one of his best works. The\\nphotograph will show how full of pretty thoughts it is, but in colour\\nit is more charming still and the green of the lily stalks is not\\nthe least delightful circumstance. Not only among works of sculpture\\nbut among Annunciations this relief holds a very high place. Few of\\nthe artists devised a scene in which the great news was brought more\\nengagingly, in sweeter surroundings, or received more simply.\\n\\nThe door of the chapel close by leads to another work of art equally\\nadapted to its situation -- Ghirlandaio's Adoration of the Magi: one of\\nthe perfect pictures for children. We have seen Ghirlandaio's Adoration\\nof the Shepherds at the Accademia: this is its own brother. It has\\nthe sweetest, mildest little Mother, and in addition to the elderly\\nMagi two tiny little saintlings adore too. In the distance is an\\nenchanted landscape about a fairy estuary.\\n\\nThis hospital is a very busy one, and the authorities are glad to show\\nit to visitors who really take an interest in such work. Rich Italians\\ncarry on a fine rivalry in generosity to such institutions. Bologna,\\nfor instance, could probably give lessons in thoughtful charity to\\nthe whole world.\\n\\nThe building opposite the hospital has a loggia which is notable\\nfor a series of four arches, like those of the Mercato Nuovo, and in\\nsummer for the flowers that hang down from the little balconies. A\\npretty building. Before turning to the right under the last of the\\narches of the hospital loggia, which opens on the Via della Colonna\\nand from the piazza always frames such a charming picture of houses\\nand mountains, it is well, with so much of Andrea del Sarto's work\\nwarm in one's memory, to take a few steps up the Via Gino Capponi\\n(which also always frames an Apennine vista under its arch) to No. 24,\\nand see Andrea's house, on the right, marked with a tablet.\\n\\nIn the Via della Colonna we find, at No. 26 on the left, the Palazzo\\nCrocetta, which is now a Museum of Antiquities, and for its Etruscan\\nexhibits is of the greatest historical value and interest to visitors\\nto Tuscany, such as ourselves. For here you may see what civilization\\nwas like centuries before Christ and Rome. The beginnings of the\\nEtruscan people are indistinct, but about 1000 B.C. has been agreed\\nto as the dawn of their era. Etruria comprised Tuscany, Perugia,\\nand Rome itself. Florence has no remains, but Fiesole was a fortified\\nEtruscan town, and many traces of its original builders may be seen\\nthere, together with Etruscan relics in the little museum. For the\\nbest reconstructions of an Etruscan city one must go to Volterra,\\nwhere so many of the treasures in the present building were found.\\n\\nThe Etruscans in their heyday were the most powerful people in\\nthe world, but after the fifth century their supremacy gradually\\ndisappeared, the Gauls on the one side and the Romans on the other\\nwearing them down. All our knowledge of them comes through the\\nspade. Excavations at Volterra and elsewhere have revealed some\\nthousands of inscriptions which have been in part deciphered; but\\nnothing has thrown so much light on this accomplished people as their\\nhabit of providing the ashes of their dead with everything likely\\nto be needed for the next world, whose requirements fortunately so\\nexactly tallied with those of this that a complete system of domestic\\ncivilization can be deduced. In arts and sciences they were most\\nenviably advanced, as a visit to the British Museum will show in\\na moment. But it is to this Florentine Museum of Antiquities that\\nall students of Etruria must go. The garden contains a number of the\\ntombs themselves, rebuilt and refurnished exactly as they were found;\\nwhile on the ground floor is the amazing collection of articles which\\nthe tombs yielded. The grave has preserved them for us, not quite\\nso perfectly as the volcanic dust of Vesuvius preserved the domestic\\nappliances of Pompeii, but very nearly so. Jewels, vessels, weapons,\\nornaments -- many of them of a beauty never since reproduced -- are to\\nbe seen in profusion, now gathered together for study only a short\\ndistance from the districts in which centuries ago they were made\\nand used for actual life.\\n\\nUpstairs we find relics of an older civilization still, the Egyptian,\\nand a few rooms of works of art, all found in Etruscan soil,\\nthe property of the Pierpont Morgans and George Saltings of that\\nancient day, who had collected them exactly as we do now. Certain\\nof the statues are world-famous. Here, for example, in Sala IX, is\\nthe bronze Minerva which was found near Arezzo in 1554 by Cosimo's\\nworkmen. Here is the Chim\\u00e6ra, also from Arezzo in 1554, which Cellini\\nrestored for Cosimo and tells us about in his Autobiography. Here is\\nthe superb Orator from Lake Trasimene, another of Cosimo's discoveries.\\n\\nIn Sala X look at the bronze situla in an isolated glass case, of such\\na peacock blue as only centuries could give it. Upstairs in Sala XVI\\nare many more Greek and Roman bronzes, among which I noticed a faun\\nwith two pipes as being especially good; while the little room leading\\nfrom it has some fine life-size heads, including a noble one of a\\nhorse, and the famous Idolino on its elaborate pedestal -- a full-length\\nGreek bronze from the earth of Pesaro, where it was found in 1530.\\n\\nThe top floor is given to tapestries and embroideries. The collection\\nis vast and comprises much foreign work; but Cosimo I introducing\\ntapestry weaving into Florence, many of the examples come from the\\ncity's looms. The finest, or at any rate most interesting, series\\nis that depicting the court of France under Catherine de' Medici,\\nwith portraits: very sumptuous and gay examples of Flemish work.\\n\\nThe trouble at Florence is that one wants the days to be ten times as\\nlong in order that one may see its wonderful possessions properly. Here\\nis this dry-looking archaeological museum, with antipathetic custodians\\nat the door who refuse to get change for twenty-lira pieces: nothing\\ncould be more unpromising than they or their building; and yet you\\nfind yourself instantly among countless vestiges of a past people who\\nhad risen to power and crumbled again before Christ was born -- but at\\na time when man was so vastly more sensitive to beauty than he now is\\nthat every appliance for daily life was the work of an artist. Well,\\na collection like this demands days and days of patient examination,\\nand one has only a few hours. Were I Joshua -- had I his curious gift -- it\\nis to Florence I would straightway fare. The sun should stand still\\nthere: no rock more motionless.\\n\\nContinuing along the Via della Colonna, we come, on the right,\\nat No. 8, to the convent of S. Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi, which is\\nnow a barracks but keeps sacred one room in which Perugino painted a\\ncrucifixion, his masterpiece in fresco. The work is in three panels,\\nof which that on the left, representing the Virgin and S. Bernard,\\nis the most beautiful. Indeed, there is no more beautiful light\\nin any picture we shall see, and the Virgin's melancholy face is\\ninexpressibly sweet. Perugino is best represented at the Accademia,\\nand there are works of his at the Uffizi and Pitti and in various\\nFlorentine churches; but here he is at his best. Vasari tells us that\\nhe made much money and was very fond of it; also that he liked his\\nyoung wife to wear light head-dresses both out of doors and in the\\nhouse, and often dressed her himself. His master was Verrocchio and\\nhis best pupil Raphael.\\n\\nS. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, a member of the same family that plotted\\nagainst the Medici and owned the sacred flints, was born in 1566, and,\\nsays Miss Dunbar, \\\"showed extraordinary piety from a very tender\\nage\\\". When only a child herself she used to teach small children, and\\nshe daily carried lunch to the prisoners. Her real name was Catherine,\\nbut becoming a nun she called herself Mary Magdalene. In an illness in\\nwhich she was given up for dead, she lay on her bed for forty days,\\nduring which she saw continual visions, and then recovered. Like\\nS. Catherine of Bologna she embroidered well and painted miraculously,\\nand she once healed a leprosy by licking it. She died in 1607.\\n\\nThe old English Cemetery, as it is usually called -- the Protestant\\nCemetery, as it should be called -- is an oval garden of death in the\\nPiazza Donatello, at the end of the Via di Pinti and the Via Alfieri,\\nrising up from the boulevard that surrounds the northern half of\\nFlorence. (The new Protestant Cemetery is outside the city on the\\nroad to the Certosa.) I noticed, as I walked beneath the cypresses,\\nthe grave of Arthur Hugh Clough, the poet of \\\"Dipsychus,\\\" who died\\nhere in Florence on November 13th, 1861; of Walter Savage Landor,\\nthat old lion (born January 30th, 1775; died September 17th, 1864),\\nof whom I shall say much more in a later chapter; of his son Arnold,\\nwho was born in 1818 and died in 1871; and of Mrs. Holman Hunt, who\\ndied in 1866. But the most famous grave is that of Elizabeth Barrett\\nBrowning, who lies beneath a massive tomb that bears only the initials\\nE.B.B. and the date 1861. \\\"Italy,\\\" wrote James Thomson, the poet of\\n\\\"The City of Dreadful Night,\\\" on hearing of Mrs. Browning's death,\\n\\n\\n\\\"Italy, you hold in trust\\nVery sacred human dust.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nThe Cascine and the Arno\\n\\nFlorence's Bois de Boulogne -- Shelley -- The races -- The game of\\nPallone -- SS. Ognissanti -- Botticelli and Ghirlandaio -- Amerigo\\nVespucci -- The Platonic Academy's garden -- Alberti's Palazzo\\nRucellai -- Melancholy decay -- Two smiling boys -- The Corsini\\npalace -- The Trinit\\u00e0 bridge -- The Borgo San Jacopo from the back -- Home\\nfishing -- SS. Apostoli -- A sensitive river -- The Ponte Vecchio -- The\\ngoldsmiths -- S. Stefano.\\n\\nThe Cascine is the \\\"Bois\\\" of Florence; but it does not compare with\\nthe Parisian expanse either in size or attraction. Here the wealthy\\nFlorentines drive, the middle classes saunter and ride bicycles, the\\npoor enjoy picnics, and the English take country walks. The further\\none goes the better it is, and the better also the river, which at\\nthe very end of the woods becomes such a stream as the pleinairistes\\nlove, with pollarded trees on either side. Among the trees of one of\\nthese woods nearly a hundred years ago, a walking Englishman named\\nPercy Bysshe Shelley wrote his \\\"Ode to the West Wind\\\".\\n\\nThe Cascine is a Bois also in having a race-course in it -- a small\\ncourse with everything about it on a little scale, grandstand, betting\\nboxes, and all. And why not? -- for after all Florence is quite small in\\nsize, however remarkable in character. Here funny little race-meetings\\nare held, beginning on Easter Monday and continuing at intervals until\\nthe weather gets too hot. The Florentines pour out in their hundreds\\nand lie about in the long grass among the wild flowers, and in their\\nfives and tens back their fancies. The system is the pari-mutuel,\\nand here one seems to be more at its mercy even than in France. The\\nodds keep distressingly low; but no one seems to be either elated or\\ndepressed, whatever happens. To be at the races is the thing -- to walk\\nabout and watch the people and enjoy the air. It is the most orderly\\nfrugal scene, and the baleful and mysterious power of the racehorse\\nto poison life and landscape, as in England, does not exist here.\\n\\nTo the Cascine also in the spring and autumn several hundred Florentine\\nmen come every afternoon to see the game of pallone and risk a few lire\\non their favourite players. Mr. Ruskin, whose \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\"\\nis still the textbook of the devout, is severe enough upon those\\nvisitors who even find it in their hearts to shop and gossip in the\\ncity of Giotto. What then would he have said of one who has spent not\\na few afternoon hours, between five and six, in watching the game of\\npallone? I would not call pallone a good game. Compared with tennis,\\nit is nothing; compared with lawn tennis, it is poor; compared with\\nfootball, it is anaemic; yet in an Italian city, after the galleries\\nhave closed, on a warm afternoon, it will do, and it will more than\\ndo as affording an opportunity of seeing muscular Italian athletes in\\nthe pink of condition. The game is played by six, three each side:\\na battitore, who smites the ball, which is served to him very much\\nas in rounders; the spalla, who plays back; and the terzino, who\\nplays forward. The court is sixty or more yards long, on one side\\nbeing a very high wall and on the other and at each end netting. The\\nimplements are the ball, which is hollow and of leather, about half\\nthe size of a football, and a cylinder studded with spikes, rather\\nlike a huge fir-cone or pine-apple, which is placed over the wrist\\nand forearm to hit the ball with; and the game is much as in tennis,\\nonly there is no central net: merely a line. Each man's ambition,\\nhowever, is less to defeat the returning power of the foe than to\\nparalyse it by hitting the ball out of reach. It is as though a\\nbatsman were out if he failed to hit three wides.\\n\\nA good battitore, for instance, can smite the ball right down the\\nsixty yards into the net, above the head of the opposing spalla who\\nstands awaiting it at the far end. Such a stroke is to the English\\nmind a blot, and it is no uncommon thing, after each side has had a\\ngood rally, to see the battitore put every ball into the net in this\\nway and so win the game without his opponents having one return;\\nwhich is the very negation of sport. Each innings lasts until one\\nside has gained eight points, the points going to whichever player\\nmakes the successful stroke. This means that the betting -- and of\\ncourse there is betting -- is upon individuals and not upon sides.\\n\\nThe pari-mutuel system is that which is adopted at both the pallone\\ncourts in Florence (there is another at the Piazza Beccaria), and the\\nunit is two lire. Bets are invited on the winner and the second, and\\nplace-money is paid on both. No wonder then that as the game draws to a\\nclose the excitement becomes intense; while during its progress feeling\\nruns high too. For how can a young Florentine who has his money on,\\nsay, Gabri the battitore, withhold criticism when Gabri's arm fails\\nand the ball drops comfortably for the terzino Ugo to smash it into\\nGabri's net? Such a lapse should not pass unnoticed; nor does it.\\n\\nFrom the Cascine we may either return to Florence along the banks\\nof the river, or cross the river by the vile iron Ponte Sospeso\\nand enter the city again, on the Pitti side, by the imposing Porta\\nS. Frediano. Supposing that we return by the Lungarno Amerigo Vespucci\\nthere is little to notice, beyond costly modern houses of a Portland\\nPlace type and the inevitable Garibaldi statue, until, just past the\\noblique pescaja (or weir), we see across the Piazza Manin the church\\nof All Saints -- S. Salvadore d'Ognissanti, which must be visited since\\nit is the burial-place of Botticelli and Amerigo Vespucci, the chapel\\nof the Vespucci family being painted by Ghirlandaio; and since here too\\nlies Botticelli's beautiful Simonetta, who so untimely died. According\\nto Vasari the frescoes of S. Jerome by Ghirlandaio and S. Augustine by\\nBotticelli were done in competition. They were painted, as it happens,\\nelsewhere, but moved here without injury. I think the S. Jerome is the\\nmore satisfying, a benevolent old scientific author -- a Lord Avebury\\nof the canon -- with his implements about him on a tapestry tablecloth,\\na brass candlestick, his cardinal's hat, and a pair of tortoise-shell\\neyeglasses handy. S. Augustine is also scientific; astronomical books\\nand instruments surround him too. His tablecloth is linen.\\n\\nAmerigo Vespucci, whose statue we saw in the Uffizi portico\\ncolonnade, was a Florentine by birth who settled in Spain and took to\\nexploration. His discoveries were important, but America is not really\\namong them, for Columbus, whom he knew and supported financially,\\ngot there first. By a mistake in the date in his account of his\\ntravels, Vespucci's name came to be given to the new continent, and\\nit was then too late to alter it. He became a naturalized Spaniard\\nand died in 1512. Columbus indeed suffers in Florence; for had it\\nnot been for Vespucci, America would no doubt be called Columbia;\\nwhile Brunelleschi anticipated him in the egg trick.\\n\\nThe church is very proud of possessing the robe of S. Francis, which\\nis displayed once a year on October 4th. In the refectory is a \\\"Last\\nSupper\\\" by Ghirlandaio, not quite so good as that which we saw at\\nS. Marco, but very similar, and, like that, deriving from Castagno's\\nat the Cenacolo di Sant' Apollonia. The predestined Judas is once\\nmore on the wrong side of the table.\\n\\nReturning to the river bank again, we are at once among the hotels and\\npensions, which continue cheek by jowl right away to the Ponte Vecchio\\nand beyond. In the Piazza Goldoni, where the Ponte Carraia springs off,\\nseveral streets meet, best of them and busiest of them being that Via\\ndella Vigna Nuova which one should miss few opportunities of walking\\nalong, for here is the palazzo -- at No. 20 -- which Leon Battista Alberti\\ndesigned for the Rucellai. The Rucellai family's present palace, I\\nmay say here, is in the Via della Scala, and by good fortune I found\\nat the door sunning himself a complacent major-domo who, the house\\nbeing empty of its august owners, allowed me to walk through into\\nthe famous garden -- the Orti Oricellari -- where the Platonic Academy\\nmet for a while in Bernardo Rucellai's day. A monument inscribed\\nwith their names has been erected among the evergreens. Afterwards\\nthe garden was given by Francis I to his beloved Bianca Capella. Its\\nnatural beauties are impaired by a gigantic statue of Polyphemus,\\nbigger than any other statue in Florence.\\n\\nThe new Rucellai palace does not compare with the old, which is, I\\nthink, the most beautiful of all the private houses of the great day,\\nand is more easily seen too, for there is a little piazza in front\\nof it. The palace, with its lovely design and its pilastered windows,\\nis now a rookery, while various industries thrive beneath it. Part of\\nthe right side has been knocked away; but even still the proportions\\nare noble. This is a bad quarter for vandalism; for in the piazza\\nopposite is a most exquisite little loggia, built in 1468, the three\\nlovely arches of which have been filled in and now form the windows of\\nan English establishment known as \\\"The Artistic White House\\\". An absurd\\nname, for if it were really artistic it would open up the arches again.\\n\\nThe Rucellai chapel, behind the palace, is in the Via della Spada,\\nand the key must be asked for in the palace stables. It is in a\\nshocking state, and quite in keeping with the traditions of the\\nneighbourhood, while the old church of S. Pancrazio, its neighbour,\\nis now a Government tobacco factory. The Rucellai chapel contains a\\nmodel of the Holy Sepulchre, at Jerusalem, in marble and intarsia,\\nby the great Alberti -- one of the most jewel-like little buildings\\nimaginable. Within it are the faint vestiges of a fresco which the\\nstable-boy calls a Botticelli, and indeed the hands and faces of\\nthe angels, such as one can see of them with a farthing dip, do not\\nrender the suggestion impossible. On the altar is a terra-cotta Christ\\nwhich he calls a Donatello, and again he may be right; but fury at a\\ncondition of things that can permit such a beautiful place to be so\\ndesecrated renders it impossible to be properly appreciative.\\n\\nSince we are here, instead of returning direct to the river let us\\ngo a few yards along this Via della Spada to the left, cross the\\nVia de' Fossi, and so come to the busy Via di Pallazzuolo, on the\\nleft of which, past the piazza of S. Paolino, is the little church of\\nS. Francesco de' Vanchetoni. This church is usually locked, but the key\\nis next door, on the right, and it has to be obtained because over the\\nright sacristy door is a boy's head by Rossellino, and over the left a\\nboy's head by Desiderio da Settignano, and each is joyful and perfect.\\n\\nThe Via de' Fossi will bring us again to the Piazza Goldoni and the\\nArno, and a few yards farther along there is a palace to be seen,\\nthe Corsini, the only palazzo still inhabited by its family to which\\nstrangers are admitted -- the long low white fa\\u00e7ade with statues on\\nthe top and a large courtyard, on the Lungarno Corsini, just after\\nthe Piazza Goldoni. It is not very interesting and belongs to the\\nwrong period, the seventeenth century. It is open on fixed days,\\nand free save that one manservant receives the visitor and another\\nconducts him from room to room. There are many pictures, but few\\nof outstanding merit, and the authorship of some of these has been\\nchallenged. Thus, the cartoon of Julius II, which is called a Raphael\\nand seems to be the sketch for one of the well-known portraits at the\\nPitti, Uffizi, or our National Gallery, is held to be not by Raphael\\nat all. Among the pleasantest pictures are a Lippo Lippi Madonna and\\nChild, a Filippino Lippi Madonna and Child with Angels, and a similar\\ngroup by Botticelli; but one has a feeling that Carlo Dolci and Guido\\nReni are the true heroes of the house. Guido Reni's Lucrezia Romana,\\nwith a dagger which she has already thrust two inches into her bosom,\\nas though it were cheese, is one of the most foolish pictures I ever\\nsaw. The Corsini family having given the world a pope, a case of papal\\nvestments is here. It was this Pope when Cardinal Corsini who said to\\nDr. Johnson's friend, Mrs. Piozzi, meeting him in Florence in 1785,\\n\\\"Well, Madam, you never saw one of us red-legged partridges before,\\nI believe\\\".\\n\\nThere may be more beautiful bridges in the world than the Trinit\\u00e0,\\nbut I have seen none. Its curve is so gentle and soft, and its three\\narches so light and graceful, that I wonder that whenever new bridges\\nare necessary the authorities do not insist upon the Trinit\\u00e0 being\\ncopied. The Ponte Vecchio, of course, has a separate interest of its\\nown, and stands apart, like the Rialto. It is a bridge by chance, one\\nmight almost say. But the Trinit\\u00e0 is a bridge in intent and supreme at\\nthat, the most perfect union of two river banks imaginable. It shows\\nto what depths modern Florence can fall -- how little she esteems her\\npast -- that the iron bridge by the Cascine should ever have been built.\\n\\nThe various yellows of Florence -- the prevailing colours -- are spread\\nout nowhere so favourably as on the Pitti side of the river between\\nthe Trinit\\u00e0 and the Ponte Vecchio on the backs of the houses of the\\nBorgo San Jacopo, and just so must this row have looked for four\\nhundred years. Certain of the occupants of these tenements, even on\\nthe upper floors, have fishing nets, on pulleys, which they let down\\nat intervals during the day for the minute fish which seem to be as\\nprecious to Italian fishermen as sparrows and wrens to Italian gunners.\\n\\nThe great palace at the Trinit\\u00e0 end of this stretch of yellow\\nbuildings -- the Frescobaldi -- must have been very striking when the\\nloggia was open: the three rows of double arches that are now walled\\nin. From this point, as well as from similar points on the other\\nside of the Ponte Vecchio, one realizes the mischief done by Cosimo\\nI's secret passage across it; for not only does the passage impose a\\nstraight line on a bridge that was never intended to have one, but it\\ncuts Florence in two. If it were not for its large central arches one\\nwould, from the other bridges or the embankment, see nothing whatever\\nof the further side of the city; but as it is, through these arches\\none has heavenly vignettes.\\n\\nWe leave the river again for a few minutes about fifty yards along\\nthe Lungarno Acciaioli beyond the Trinit\\u00e0 and turn up a narrow passage\\nto see the little church of SS. Apostoli, where there is a delightful\\ngay ciborium, all bright colours and happiness, attributed to Andrea\\ndella Robbia, with pretty cherubs and pretty angels, and a benignant\\nChrist and flowers and fruit which cannot but chase away gloom and\\ndubiety. Here also is a fine tomb by the sculptor of the elaborate\\nchimney-piece which we saw in the Bargello, Benedetto da Rovezzano,\\nwho also designed the church's very beautiful door. Whether or\\nnot it is true that SS. Apostoli was built by Charlemagne, it is\\ncertainly very old and architecturally of great interest. Vasari says\\nthat Brunelleschi acquired from it his inspiration for S. Lorenzo\\nand S. Spirito. To many Florentines its principal importance is its\\ncustody of the Pazzi flints for the igniting of the sacred fire which\\nin turn ignites the famous Carro.\\n\\nReturning again to the embankment, we are quickly at the Ponte\\nVecchio, where it is pleasant at all times to loiter and observe\\nboth the river and the people; while from its central arches one\\nsees the mountains. From no point are the hill of S. Miniato and\\nits stately cypresses more beautiful; but one cannot see the church\\nitself -- only the church of S. Niccol\\u00f2 below it, and of course the\\nbronze \\\"David\\\". In dry weather the Arno is green; in rainy weather\\nyellow. It is so sensitive that one can almost see it respond to the\\nmost distant shower; but directly the rain falls and it is fed by\\na thousand Apennine torrents it foams past this bridge in fury. The\\nPonte Vecchio was the work, upon a Roman foundation, of Taddeo Gaddi,\\nGiotto's godson, in the middle of the fourteenth century, but the\\nshops are, of course, more recent. The passage between the Pitti\\nand Uffizi was added in 1564. Gaddi, who was a fresco painter first\\nand architect afterwards, was employed because Giotto was absent in\\nMilan, Giotto being the first thought of every one in difficulties\\nat that time. The need, however, was pressing, for a flood in 1333\\nhad destroyed a large part of the Roman bridge. Gaddi builded so well\\nthat when, two hundred and more years later, another flood severely\\ndamaged three other bridges, the Ponte Vecchio was unharmed. None\\nthe less it is not Gaddi's bust but Cellini's that has the post of\\nhonour in the centre; but this is, of course, because Cellini was\\na goldsmith, and it is to goldsmiths that the shops belong. Once it\\nwas the butchers' quarter!\\n\\nI never cross the Ponte Vecchio and see these artificers in their\\nblouses through the windows, without wondering if in any of their boy\\nassistants is the Michelangelo, or Orcagna, or Ghirlandaio, or even\\nCellini, of the future, since all of those, and countless others of\\nthe Renaissance masters, began in precisely this way.\\n\\nThe odd thing is that one is on the Ponte Vecchio, from either\\nend, before one knows it to be a bridge at all. A street of sudden\\nsteepness is what it seems to be. Not the least charming thing upon\\nit is the masses of groundsel which have established themselves on\\nthe pent roof over the goldsmiths' shops. Every visitor to Florence\\nmust have longed to occupy one of these little bridge houses; but I\\nam not aware that any has done so.\\n\\nOne of the oldest streets in Florence must be the Via Girolami, from\\nthe Ponte Vecchio to the Uffizi, under an arch. A turning to the left\\nbrings one to the Piazza S. Stefano, where the barn-like church of\\nS. Stefano is entered; and close by is the Torre de' Girolami, where\\nS. Zenobius lived. S. Stefano, although it is now so easily overlooked,\\nwas of importance in its day, and it was here that Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano,\\nthe leader of the nobles, held a meeting to devise means of checking\\nthe growing power of the people early in the fifteenth century and was\\nthwarted by old Giovanni de' Medici. From that thwarting proceeded\\nthe power of the Medici family and the gloriously endowed Florence\\nthat we travel to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nS. Maria Novella\\n\\nThe great churches of Florence -- A Dominican cathedral -- The \\\"Decameron\\\"\\nbegins -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Alessio Baldovinetti -- The Louvre -- The\\nS. Maria Novella frescoes -- Giovanni and Lorenzo Tornabuoni -- Ruskin\\nimplacable -- Cimabue's Madonna -- Filippino Lippi -- Orcagna's \\\"Last\\nJudgment\\\" -- The Cloisters of Florence -- The Spanish Chapel -- S. Dominic\\ntriumphant -- Giotto at his sweetest -- The \\\"Wanderer's\\\" doom -- The Piazza,\\nas an arena.\\n\\nS. Maria Novella is usually bracketed with S. Croce as the most\\ninteresting Florentine church after the Duomo, but S. Lorenzo has of\\ncourse to be reckoned with very seriously. I think that for interest\\nI should place S. Maria Novella fifth, including also the Baptistery\\nbefore it, but architecturally second. Its interior is second in\\nbeauty only to S. Croce. S. Croce is its immediate religious rival,\\nfor it was because the Dominicans had S. Maria Novella, begun in\\n1278, that several years later the Franciscans determined to have an\\nequally important church and built S. Croce. The S. Maria Novella\\narchitects were brothers of the order, but Talenti, whom we saw at\\nwork both on Giotto's tower and on San Michele, built the campanile,\\nand Leon Battista Alberti the marble fa\\u00e7ade, many years later. The\\nrichest patrons of S. Maria Novella -- corresponding to the Medici at\\nS. Lorenzo and the Bardi at S. Croce -- were the Rucellai, whose palace,\\ndesigned also by the wonderful versatile Alberti, we have seen.\\n\\nThe interior of S. Maria Novella is very fine and spacious, and\\nit gathers and preserves an exquisite light at all times of the\\nday. Nowhere in Florence is there a finer aisle, with the roof\\nspringing so nobly and masterfully from the eight columns on either\\nside. The whole effect, like that of S. Croce, is rather northern,\\nthe result of the yellow and brown hues; but whereas S. Croce has a\\ncrushing flat roof, this one is all soaring gladness.\\n\\nThe finest view of the interior is from the altar steps looking back\\nto the beautiful circular window over the entrance, a mass of happy\\ncolour. In the afternoon the little plain circular windows high up\\nin the aisle shoot shafts of golden light upon the yellow walls. The\\nhigh altar of inlaid marble is, I think, too bright and too large. The\\nchurch is more impressive on Good Friday, when over this altar is built\\na Calvary with the crucifix on the summit and life-size mourners at its\\nfoot; while a choir and string orchestra make superbly mournful music.\\n\\nI like to think that it was within the older S. Maria Novella that\\nthose seven mirthful young ladies of Florence remained one morning\\nin 1348, after Mass, to discuss plans of escape from the city during\\nthe plague. As here they chatted and plotted, there entered the church\\nthree young men; and what simpler than to engage them as companions in\\ntheir retreat, especially as all three, like all seven of the young\\nwomen, were accomplished tellers of stories with no fear whatever of\\nMrs. Grundy? And thus the \\\"Decameron\\\" of Giovanni Boccaccio came about.\\n\\nS. Maria Novella also resembles S. Croce in its moving groups of\\nsight-seers each in the hands of a guide. These one sees always and\\nhears always: so much so that a reminder has been printed and set up\\nhere and there in this church, to the effect that it is primarily the\\nhouse of God and for worshippers. But S. Maria Novella has not a tithe\\nof S. Croce's treasures. Having almost no tombs of first importance,\\nit has to rely upon its interior beauty and upon its frescoes, and\\nits chief glory, whatever Mr. Ruskin, who hated them, might say, is,\\nfor most people, Ghirlandaio's series of scenes in the life of the\\nVirgin and S. John the Baptist. These cover the walls of the choir\\nand for more than four centuries have given delight to Florentines\\nand foreigners. Such was the thoroughness of their painter in his\\ncolour mixing (in which the boy Michelangelo assisted him) that,\\nalthough they have sadly dimmed and require the best morning light,\\nthey should endure for centuries longer, a reminder not only of\\nthe thoughtful sincere interesting art of Ghirlandaio and of the\\npious generosity of the Tornabuoni family, who gave them, but also\\nof the costumes and carriage of the Florentine ladies at the end\\nof the fifteenth century when Lorenzo the Magnificent was in his\\nzenith. Domenico Ghirlandaio may not be quite of the highest rank\\namong the makers of Florence; but he comes very near it, and indeed,\\nby reason of being Michelangelo's first instructor, perhaps should\\nstand amid them. But one thing is certain -- that without him Florence\\nwould be the poorer by many beautiful works.\\n\\nHe was born in 1449, twenty-one years after the death of Masaccio and\\nthree before Leonardo, twenty-six before Michelangelo, and thirty-four\\nbefore Raphael. His full name was Domenico or Tommaso di Currado di\\nDoffo Bigordi, but his father Tommaso Bigordi, a goldsmith, having\\nhit upon a peculiarly attractive way of making garlands for the hair,\\nwas known as Ghirlandaio, the garland maker; and time has effaced\\nthe Bigordi completely.\\n\\nThe portraits of both Tommaso and Domenico, side by side, occur in the\\nfresco representing Joachim driven from the Temple: Domenico, who is to\\nbe seen second from the extreme right, a little resembles our Charles\\nII. Like his father, and, as we have seen, like most of the artists of\\nFlorence, he too became a goldsmith, and his love of the jewels that\\ngoldsmiths made may be traced in his pictures; but at an early age he\\nwas sent to Alessio Baldovinetti to learn to be a painter. Alessio's\\nwork we find all over Florence: a Last Judgment in the Accademia, for\\nexample, but that is not a very pleasing thing; a Madonna Enthroned,\\nin the Uffizi; the S. Miniato frescoes; the S. Trinit\\u00e0 frescoes;\\nand that extremely charming although faded work in the outer court of\\nSS. Annunziata. For the most delightful picture from his hand, however,\\none has to go to the Louvre, where there is a Madonna and Child (1300\\na), in the early Tuscan room, which has a charm not excelled by any\\nsuch group that I know. The photographers still call it a Piero della\\nFrancesca, and the Louvre authorities omit to name it at all; but it\\nis Alessio beyond question. Next it hangs the best Ghirlandaio that\\nI know -- the very beautiful Visitation, and, to add to the interest\\nof this room to the returning Florentine wanderer, on the same wall\\nare two far more attractive works by Bastiano Mainardi (Ghirlandaio's\\nbrother-in-law and assistant at S. Maria Novella) than any in Florence.\\n\\nAlessio, who was born in 1427, was an open-handed ingenious man who\\ncould not only paint and do mosaic but once made a wonderful clock for\\nLorenzo. His experiments with colour were disastrous: hence most of his\\nfrescoes have perished; but possibly it was through Alessio's mistakes\\nthat Ghirlandaio acquired the use of such a lasting medium. Alessio\\nwas an independent man who painted from taste and not necessity.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's chief influences, however, were Masaccio, at the Carmine,\\nFra Lippo Lippi, and Verrocchio, who is thought also to have been\\nBaldovinetti's pupil and whose Baptism of Christ, in the Accademia,\\npainted when Ghirlandaio was seventeen, must have given Ghirlandaio\\nthe lines for his own treatment of the incident in this church. One\\nhas also only to compare Verrocchio's sculptured Madonnas in the\\nBargello with many of Ghirlandaio's to see the influence again;\\nboth were attracted by a similar type of sweet, easy-natured girl.\\n\\nWhen he was twenty-six Ghirlandaio went to Rome to paint the Sixtine\\nlibrary, and then to San Gimignano, where he was assisted by Mainardi,\\nwho was to remain his most valuable ally in executing the large\\ncommissions which were to come to his workshop. His earliest Florentine\\nfrescoes are those which we shall see at Ognissanti; the Madonna della\\nMisericordia and the Deposition painted for the Vespucci family and\\nonly recently discovered, together with the S. Jerome, in the church,\\nand the Last Supper, in the refectory. By this time Ghirlandaio and\\nBotticelli were in some sort of rivalry, although, so far as I know,\\nfriendly enough, and both went to Rome in 1481, together with Perugino,\\nPiero di Cosimo, Cosimo Rosselli, Luca Signorelli and others, at\\nthe command of Pope Sixtus IV to decorate the Sixtine chapel, the\\nexcommunication of all Florentines which the Pope had decreed after\\nthe failure of the Pazzi Conspiracy to destroy the Medici (as we saw\\nin chapter II) having been removed in order to get these excellent\\nworkmen to the Holy City. Painting very rapidly the little band had\\nfinished their work in six months, and Ghirlandaio was at home again\\nwith such an ambition and industry in him that he once expressed the\\nwish that every inch of the walls of Florence might be covered by\\nhis brush -- and in those days Florence had walls all round it, with\\ntwenty-odd towers in addition to the gates. His next great frescoes\\nwere those in the Palazzo Vecchio and S. Trinita. It was in 1485\\nthat he painted his delightful Adoration, at the Accademia, and in\\n1486 he began his great series at S. Maria Novella, finishing them\\nin 1490, his assistants being his brother David, Benedetto Mainardi,\\nwho married Ghirlandaio's sister, and certain apprentices, among them\\nthe youthful Michelangelo, who came to the studio in 1488.\\n\\nThe story of the frescoes is this. Ghirlandaio when in Rome had\\nmet Giovanni Tornabuoni, a wealthy merchant whose wife had died\\nin childbirth. Her death we have already seen treated in relief by\\nVerrocchio in the Bargello. Ghirlandaio was first asked to beautify\\nin her honour the Minerva at Rome, where she was buried, and this\\nhe did. Later when Giovanni Tornabuoni wished to present S. Maria\\nNovella with a handsome benefaction, he induced the Ricci family,\\nwho owned this chapel, to allow him to re-decorate it, and engaged\\nGhirlandaio for the task. This meant first covering the fast fading\\nfrescoes by Orcagna, which were already there, and then painting over\\nthem. What the Orcagnas were like we cannot know; but the substitute,\\nalthough probably it had less of curious genius in it was undoubtedly\\nmore attractive to the ordinary observer.\\n\\nThe right wall, as one faces the window (whose richness of coloured\\nglass, although so fine in the church as a whole, is here such a\\nprivation), is occupied by scenes in the story of the Baptist; the\\nleft by the life of the Virgin. The left of the lowest pair on the\\nright wall represents S. Mary and S. Elizabeth, and in it a party of\\nGhirlandaio's stately Florentine ladies watch the greeting of the two\\nsaints outside Florence itself, symbolized rather than portrayed,\\nvery near the church in which we stand. The girl in yellow, on the\\nright of the picture, with her handkerchief in her hand and wearing a\\nrich dress, is Giovanna degli Albizzi, who married Lorenzo Tornabuoni\\nat the Villa Lemmi near Florence, that villa from which Botticelli's\\nexquisite fresco, now in the Louvre at the top of the main staircase,\\nin which she again is to be seen, was taken. Her life was a sad\\none, for her husband was one of those who conspired with Piero di\\nLorenzo de' Medici for his return some ten years later, and was\\nbeheaded. S. Elizabeth is of course the older woman. The companion\\nto this picture represents the angel appearing to S. Zacharias, and\\nhere again Ghirlandaio gives us contemporary Florentines, portraits\\nof distinguished Tornabuoni men and certain friends of eminence\\namong them. In the little group low down on the left, for example,\\nare Poliziano and Marsilio Ficino, the Platonist. Above -- but seeing\\nis beginning to be difficult -- the pair of frescoes represent, on the\\nright, the birth of the Baptist, and on the left, his naming. The birth\\nscene has much beauty, and is as well composed as any, and there is\\na girl in it of superb grace and nobility; but the birth scene of the\\nVirgin, on the opposite wall, is perhaps the finer and certainly more\\neasily seen. In the naming of the child we find Medici portraits once\\nmore, that family being related to the Tornabuoni; and Mr. Davies,\\nin his book on Ghirlandaio, offers the interesting suggestion, which\\nhe supports very reasonably, that the painter has made the incident\\nrefer to the naming of Lorenzo de' Medici's third son, Giovanni (or\\nJohn), who afterwards became Pope Leo X. In that case the man on the\\nleft, in green, with his hand on his hip, would be Lorenzo himself,\\nwhom he certainly resembles. Who the sponsor is is not known. The\\nlandscape and architecture are alike charming.\\n\\nAbove these we faintly see that strange Baptism of Christ, so curiously\\nlike the Verrocchio in the Accademia, and the Baptist preaching.\\n\\nThe left wall is perhaps the favourite. We begin with Joachim being\\ndriven from the Temple, one of the lowest pair; and this has a peculiar\\ninterest in giving us a portrait of the painter and his associates -- the\\nfigure on the extreme right being Benedetto Mainardi; then Domenico\\nGhirlandaio; then his father; and lastly his brother David. On the\\nopposite side of the picture is the fated Lorenzo Tornabuoni, of whom\\nI have spoken above, the figure farthest from the edge, with his hand\\non his hip. The companion picture is the most popular of all -- the\\nBirth of the Virgin -- certainly one of the most charming interiors in\\nFlorence. Here again we have portraits -- no doubt Tornabuoni ladies -- and\\nmuch pleasant fancy on the part of the painter, who made everything as\\nbeautiful as he could, totally unmindful of the probabilities. Ruskin\\nis angry with him for neglecting to show the splashing of the water\\nin the vessel, but it would be quite possible for no splashing to\\nbe visible, especially if the pouring had only just begun; but for\\nRuskin's strictures you must go to \\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" where poor\\nGhirlandaio gets a lash for every virtue of Giotto. Next -- above, on\\nthe left -- we have the Presentation of the Virgin and on the right\\nher Marriage. The Presentation is considered by Mr. Davies to be\\nalmost wholly the work of Ghirlandaio's assistants, while the youthful\\nMichelangelo himself has been credited with the half-naked figure on\\nthe steps, although Mr. Davies gives it to Mainardi. Mainardi again\\nis probably the author of the companion scene. The remaining frescoes\\nare of less interest and much damaged; but in the window wall one\\nshould notice the portraits of Giovanni Tornabuoni and Francesca di\\nLuca Pitti, his wife, kneeling, because this Giovanni was the donor\\nof the frescoes, and his sister Lucrezia was the wife of Piero de'\\nMedici and therefore the mother of Lorenzo the Magnificent, while\\nFrancesca Tornabuoni, the poor lady who died in childbirth, was the\\ndaughter of that proud Florentine who began the Pitti palace but\\nended his life in disgrace.\\n\\nAnd so we leave this beautiful recess, where pure religious feeling\\nmay perhaps be wanting but where the best spirit of the Renaissance\\nis to be found: everything making for harmony and pleasure; and on\\nreturning to London the visitor should make a point of seeing the\\nFlorentine girl by the same hand in our National Gallery, No. 1230,\\nfor she is very typical of his genius.\\n\\nOn the entrance wall of the church is what must once have been a fine\\nMasaccio -- \\\"The Trinity\\\" -- but it is in very bad condition; while in\\nthe Cappella Rucellai in the right transept is what purports to be\\na Cimabue, very like the one in the Accademia, but with a rather\\nmore matured Child in it. Vasari tells us that on its completion\\nthis picture was carried in stately procession from the painter's\\nstudio to the church, in great rejoicing and blowing of trumpets,\\nthe populace being moved not only by religious ecstasy but by pride in\\nan artist who could make such a beautiful and spacious painting, the\\nlargest then known. Vasari adds that when Cimabue was at work upon it,\\nCharles of Anjou, visiting Florence, was taken to his studio, to see\\nthe wonderful painter, and a number of Florentines entering too, they\\nbroke out into such rejoicings that the locality was known ever after\\nas Borgo Allegro, or Joyful Quarter. This would be about 1290. There\\nwas a certain fitness in Cimabue painting this Madonna, for it is said\\nthat he had his education in the convent which stood here before the\\npresent church was begun. But I should add that of Cimabue we know\\npractically nothing, and that most of Vasari's statements have been\\nconfuted, while the painter of the S. Maria Novella Madonna is held\\nby some authorities to be Duccio of Siena. So where are we?\\n\\nThe little chapel next the choir on the right is that of Filippo\\nStrozzi the elder who was one of the witnesses of the Pazzi outrage in\\nthe Duomo in 1478. This was the Filippo Strozzi who began the Strozzi\\npalace in 1489, father of the Filippo Strozzi who married Lorenzo\\nde' Medici's noble grand-daughter Clarice and came to a tragic end\\nunder Cosimo I. Old Filippo's tomb here was designed by Benedetto da\\nMaiano, who made the famous Franciscan pulpit in S. Croce, and was\\nGhirlandaio's friend and the Strozzi palace's first architect. The\\nbeautiful circular relief of the Virgin and Child, with a border of\\nroses and flying worshipping angels all about it, behind the altar, is\\nBenedetto's too, and very lovely and human are both Mother and Child.\\n\\nThe frescoes in this chapel, by Filippino Lippi, are interesting,\\nparticularly that one on the left, depicting the Resuscitation of\\nDrusiana by S. John the Evangelist, at Rome, in which the group of\\nwomen and children on the right, with the little dog, is full of\\nlife and most naturally done. Above (but almost impossible to see)\\nis S. John in his cauldron of boiling oil between Roman soldiers and\\nthe denouncing Emperor, under the banner S.P.Q.R. -- a work in which\\nRoman local colour completely excludes religious feeling. Opposite,\\nbelow, we see S. Philip exorcising a dragon, a very florid scene,\\nand, above, a painfully spirited and realistic representation of the\\nCrucifixion. The sweetness of the figures of Charity and Faith in\\nmonochrome and gold helps, with Benedetto's tondo, to engentle the air.\\n\\nWe then come again to the Choir, with Ghirlandaio's urbane Florentine\\npageant in the guise of sacred history, and pass on to the next chapel,\\nthe Cappella Gondi, where that crucifix in wood is to be seen which\\nBrunelleschi carved as a lesson to Donatello, who received it like\\nthe gentleman he was. I have told the story in Chapter XV.\\n\\nThe left transept ends in the chapel of the Strozzi family, of which\\nFilippo was the head in his day, and here we find Andrea Orcagna and\\nhis brother's fresco of Heaven, the Last Judgment and Hell. It was\\nthe two Orcagnas who, according to Vasari, had covered the Choir with\\nthose scenes in the life of the Virgin which Ghirlandaio was allowed\\nto paint over, and Vasari adds that the later artist availed himself\\nof many of the ideas of his predecessors. This, however, is not\\nvery likely, I think, except perhaps in choice of subject. Orcagna,\\nlike Giotto, and later, Michelangelo, was a student of Dante, and\\nthe Strozzi chapel frescoes follow the poet's descriptions. In the\\nLast Judgment, Dante himself is to be seen, among the elect, in the\\nattitude of prayer. Petrarch is with him.\\n\\nThe sacristy is by Talenti (of the Campanile) and was added in\\n1350. Among its treasures once were the three reliquaries painted\\nby Fra Angelico, but they are now at S. Marco. It has still rich\\nvestments, fine woodwork, and a gay and elaborate lavabo by one of\\nthe della Robbias, with its wealth of ornament and colour and its\\ncharming Madonna and Child with angels.\\n\\nA little doorway close by used to lead to the cloisters, and a\\nmercenary sacristan was never far distant, only too ready to unlock for\\na fee what should never have been locked, and black with fury if he got\\nnothing. But all this has now been done away with, and the entrance\\nto the cloisters is from the Piazza, just to the left of the church,\\nand there is a turnstile and a fee of fifty centimes. At S. Lorenzo the\\ncloisters are free. At the Carmine and the Annunziata the cloisters\\nare free. At S. Croce the charge is a lira and at S. Maria Novella\\nhalf a lira. To make a charge for the cloisters alone seems to me\\nutterly wicked. Let the Pazzi Chapel at S. Croce and the Spanish\\nChapel here have fees, if you like; but the cloisters should be open\\nto all. Children should be encouraged to play there.\\n\\nSince, however, S. Maria Novella imposes a fee we must pay it,\\nand the new arrangement at any rate carries this advantage with it,\\nthat one knows what one is expected to pay and can count on entrance.\\n\\nThe cloisters are everywhere interesting to loiter in, but their\\nchief fame is derived from the Spanish Chapel, which gained that name\\nwhen in 1566 it was put at the disposal of Eleanor of Toledo's suite\\non the occasion of her marriage to Cosimo I. Nothing Spanish about\\nit otherwise. Both structure and frescoes belong to the fourteenth\\ncentury. Of these frescoes, which are of historical and human interest\\nrather than artistically beautiful, that one on the right wall as\\nwe enter is the most famous. It is a pictorial glorification of the\\nDominican order triumphant; with a vivid reminder of the origin of\\nthe word Dominican in the episode of the wolves (or heretics) being\\nattacked by black and white dogs, the Canes Domini, or hounds of the\\nLord. The \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" should here be consulted again, for\\nRuskin made a very thorough and characteristically decisive analysis\\nof these paintings, which, whether one agrees with it or not, is\\nprofoundly interesting. Poor old Vasari, who so patiently described\\nthem too and named a number of the originals of the portraits, is now\\nshelved, and from both his artists, Simone Martini and Taddeo Gaddi,\\nhas the authorship been taken by modern experts. Some one, however,\\nmust have done the work. The Duomo as represented here is not the\\nDuomo of fact, which had not then its dome, but of anticipation.\\n\\nOpposite, we see a representation of the triumph of the greatest of the\\nDominicans, after its founder, S. Thomas Aquinas, the author of the\\n\\\"Summa Theologiae,\\\" who died in 1274. The painter shows the Angelic\\nDoctor enthroned amid saints and patriarchs and heavenly attendants,\\nwhile three powerful heretics grovel at his feet, and beneath are the\\nSciences and Moral Qualities and certain distinguished men who served\\nthem conspicuously, such as Aristotle, the logician, whom S. Thomas\\nAquinas edited, and Cicero, the rhetorician. In real life Aquinas was\\nso modest and retiring that he would accept no exalted post from the\\nChurch, but remained closeted with his books and scholars; and we can\\nconceive what his horror would be could he view this apotheosis. On the\\nceiling is a quaint rendering of the walking on the water, S. Peter's\\nfailure being watched from the ship with the utmost closeness by the\\nother disciples, but attracting no notice whatever from an angler,\\nclose by, on the shore. The chapel is desolate and unkempt, and those\\nof us who are not Dominicans are not sorry to leave it and look for\\nthe simple sweetness of the Giottos.\\n\\nThese are to be found, with some difficulty, on the walls of the niche\\nwhere the tomb of the Marchese Ridolfo stands. They are certainly\\nvery simple and telling, and I advise every one to open the \\\"Mornings\\nin Florence\\\" and learn how the wilful magical pen deals with them;\\nbut it would be a pity to give up Ghirlandaio because Giotto was so\\ndifferent, as Ruskin wished. Room for both. One scene represents\\nthe meeting of S. Joachim and S. Anna outside a mediaeval city's\\nwalls, and it has some pretty Giottesque touches, such as the man\\ncarrying doves to the Temple and the angel uniting the two saints\\nin friendliness; and the other is the Birth of the Virgin, which\\nRuskin was so pleased to pit against Ghirlandaio's treatment of the\\nsame incident. Well, it is given to some of us to see only what we\\nwant to see and be blind to the rest; and Ruskin was of these the\\nvery king. I agree with him that Ghirlandaio in both his Nativity\\nfrescoes thought little of the exhaustion of the mothers; but it is\\narguable that two such accouchements might with propriety be treated\\nas abnormal -- as indeed every painter has treated the birth of Christ,\\nwhere the Virgin, fully dressed, is receiving the Magi a few moments\\nafter. Ruskin, after making his deadly comparisons, concludes thus\\ngenially of the Giotto version -- \\\"If you can be pleased with this,\\nyou can see Florence. But if not, by all means amuse yourself there,\\nif you can find it amusing, as long as you like; you can never see it.\\\"\\n\\nThe S. Maria Novella habit is one to be quickly contracted by the\\nvisitor to Florence: nearly as important as the S. Croce habit. Both\\nchurches are hospitable and, apart from the cloisters, free and\\neminently suited for dallying in; thus differing from the Duomo,\\nwhich is dark, and S. Lorenzo, where there are payments to be made\\nand attendants to discourage.\\n\\nAn effort should be made at S. Maria Novella to get into the old\\ncloisters, which are very large and indicate what a vast convent it\\nonce was. But there is no certainty. The way is to go through to the\\nPalaestra and hope for the best. Here, as I have said in the second\\nchapter, were lodged Pope Eugenius and his suite, when they came\\nto the Council of Florence in 1439. These large and beautiful green\\ncloisters are now deserted. Through certain windows on the left one\\nmay see chemists at work compounding drugs and perfumes after old\\nDominican recipes, to be sold at the Farmacia in the Via della Scala\\nclose by. The great refectory has been turned into a gymnasium.\\n\\nThe two obelisks, supported by tortoises and surmounted by beautiful\\nlilies, in the Piazza of S. Maria Novella were used as boundaries in\\nthe chariot races held here under Cosimo I, and in the collection of\\nold Florentine prints on the top floor of Michelangelo's house you\\nmay see representations of these races. The charming loggia opposite\\nS. Maria Novella, with della Robbia decorations, is the Loggia di\\nS. Paolo, a school designed, it is thought, by Brunelleschi, and\\nhere, at the right hand end, we see S. Dominic himself in a friendly\\nembrace with S. Francis, a very beautiful group by either Luca or\\nAndrea della Robbia.\\n\\nIn the loggia cabmen now wrangle all day and all night. From it\\nS. Maria Novella is seen under the best conditions, always cheerful\\nand serene; while far behind the church is the huge Apennine where\\nmost of the weather of Florence seems to be manufactured. In mid\\nApril this year (1912) it still had its cap of snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nThe Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele to S. Trinit\\u00e0\\n\\nA city of trams -- The old market -- Donatello's figure of Abundance -- An\\nevening resort -- A hall of variety -- Florentines of to-day -- The war\\nwith Turkey -- Homecoming heroes -- Restaurants -- The new market -- The\\nbronze boar -- A fifteenth century palace -- Old Florentine life\\nreconstructed -- Where changes are few -- S. Trinit\\u00e0 -- Ghirlandaio\\nagain -- S. Francis -- The Strozzi palace -- Clarice de' Medici.\\n\\nFlorence is not simple to the stranger. Like all very old cities\\nbuilt fortuitously it is difficult to learn: the points of the\\ncompass are elusive; the streets are so narrow that the sky is no\\nconstant guide; the names of the streets are often not there; the\\npolicemen have no high standard of helpfulness. There are trams,\\nit is true -- too many and too noisy, and too near the pavement -- but\\nthe names of their outward destinations, from the centre, too rarely\\ncorrespond to any point of interest that one is desiring. Hence one\\nhas many embarrassments and even annoyances. Yet I daresay this is\\nbest: an orderly Florence is unthinkable. Since, however, the trams\\nthat are returning to the centre nearly all go to the Duomo, either\\npassing it or stopping there, the tram becomes one's best friend and\\nthe Duomo one's starting point for most excursions.\\n\\nSupposing ourselves to be there once more, let us quickly get through\\nthe horrid necessity, which confronts one in all ancient Italian\\ncities, of seeing the Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele. In an earlier chapter\\nwe left the Baptistery and walked along the Via Calzaioli. Again\\nstarting from the Baptistery let us take the Via dell' Arcivescovado,\\nwhich is parallel with the Via Calzaioli, on the right of it, and\\nagain walk straight forward. We shall come almost at once to the\\ngreat modern square.\\n\\nNo Italian city or town is complete without a Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele\\nand a statue of that monarch. In Florence the sturdy king bestrides\\nhis horse here. Italy being so old and Vittorio Emmanuele so new,\\nit follows in most cases that the square or street named after\\nhim supplants an older one, and if the Italians had any memory or\\nimaginative interest in history they would see to it that the old\\nname was not wholly obliterated. In Florence, in order to honour the\\nfirst king of United Italy, much grave violence was done to antiquity,\\nfor a very picturesque quarter had to be cleared away for the huge\\nbrasseries, stores and hotels which make up the west side; which\\nin their turn marked the site of the old market where Donatello and\\nBrunelleschi and all the later artists of the great days did their\\nshopping and met to exchange ideals and banter; and that market in\\nits turn marked the site of the Roman forum.\\n\\nOne of the features of the old market was the charming Loggia di Pesce;\\nanother, Donatello's figure of Abundance, surmounting a column. This\\nfigure is now in the museum of ancient city relics in the monastery\\nof S. Marco, where one confronts her on a level instead of looking\\nup at her in mid sky. But she is very good, none the less.\\n\\nIn talking to elderly persons who can remember Florence forty and fifty\\nyears ago I find that nothing so distresses them as the loss of the\\nold quarter for the making of this new spacious piazza; and probably\\nnothing can so delight the younger Florentines as its possession,\\nfor, having nothing to do in the evenings, they do it chiefly in the\\nPiazza Vittorio Emmanuele. Chairs and tables spring up like mushrooms\\nin the roadway, among which too few waiters distribute those very\\ninexpensive refreshments which seem to be purchased rather for the\\nright to the seat that they confer than for any stimulation. It is\\nextraordinary to the eyes of the thriftless English, who are never\\nso happy as when they are overpaying Italian and other caterers in\\ntheir own country, to notice how long these wiser folk will occupy\\na table on an expenditure of fourpence.\\n\\nI do not mean that there are no theatres in Florence. There are\\nmany, but they are not very good; and the young men can do without\\nthem. Curious old theatres, faded and artificial, all apparently built\\nfor the comedies of Goldoni. There are cinema theatres too, at prices\\nwhich would delight the English public addicted to those insidious\\nentertainments, but horrify English managers; and the Teatro Salvini\\nat the back of the Palazzo Vecchio is occasionally transformed into a\\nFolies Berg\\u00e8res (as it is called) where one after another comediennes\\nsing each two or three songs rapidly to an audience who regard them\\nwith apathy and converse without ceasing. The only sign of interest\\nwhich one observes is the murmur which follows anything a little\\noff the beaten track -- a sound that might equally be encouragement\\nor disapproval. But a really pretty woman entering a box moves\\nthem. Then they employ every note in the gamut; and curiously enough\\nthe pretty woman in the box is usually as cool under the fusillade\\nas a professional and hardened sister would be. A strange music hall\\nthis to the English eye, where the orchestra smokes, and no numbers\\nare put up, and every one talks, and the intervals seem to be hours\\nlong. But the Florentines do not mind, for they have not the English\\nthirst for entertainment and escape; they carry their entertainment\\nwith them and do not wish to escape -- going to such places only because\\nthey are warmer than out of doors.\\n\\nSitting here and watching their ironical negligence of the stage and\\ntheir interest in each other's company; their animated talk and rapid\\ndecisions as to the merits and charms of a performer; the comfort of\\ntheir attitudes and carelessness (although never quite slovenliness)\\nin dress; one seems to realize the nation better than anywhere. The\\nold fighting passion may have gone; but much of the quickness, the\\nshrewdness and the humour remains, together with the determination of\\neach man to have if possible his own way and, whether possible or not,\\nhis own say.\\n\\nSeeing them in great numbers one quickly learns and steadily\\ncorroborates the fact that the Florentines are not beautiful. A\\npretty woman or a handsome man is a rarity; but a dull-looking man\\nor woman is equally rare. They are shrewd, philosophic, cynical, and\\nvery ready for laughter. They look contented also: Florence clearly\\nis the best place to be born in, to live in, and to die in. Let all\\nthe world come to Florence, by all means, and spend its money there;\\nbut don't ask Florence to go to the world. Don't in fact ask Florence\\nto do anything very much.\\n\\nCivilization and modern conditions have done the Florentines no\\ngood. Their destiny was to live in a walled city in turbulent\\ndays, when the foe came against it, or tyranny threatened from\\nwithin and had to be resisted. They were then Florentines and\\neverything mattered. To-day they are Italians and nothing matters\\nvery much. Moreover, it must be galling to have somewhere in the\\nrecesses of their consciousness the knowledge that their famous city,\\nbuilt and cemented with their ancestors' blood, is now only a museum.\\n\\nWhen it is fine and warm the music hall does not exist, and it is\\nin the Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele that the Florentines sit and talk,\\nor walk and talk, or listen to the band which periodically inhabits a\\nstand near the centre; and it was here that I watched the reception\\nof the news that Italy had declared war on Turkey, a decision which\\nwhile it rejoiced the national warlike spirit of the populace could\\nnot but carry with it a reminder that wars have to be paid for. Six\\nor seven months later I saw the return to Florence of the first\\ntroops from the war, and their reception was terrific. In the mass\\nthey were welcome enough; but as soon as units could be separated\\nfrom the mass the fun began, for they were carried shoulder high to\\nwhatever destination they wanted, their knapsacks and rifles falling\\nto proud bearers too; while the women clapped from the upper windows,\\nthe shrewd shopkeepers cheered from their doorways, and the crowd which\\nfollowed and surrounded the hero every moment increased. As for the\\nheroes, they looked for the most part a good deal less foolish than\\nEnglishmen would have done; but here and there was one whose expression\\nsuggested that the Turks were nothing to this. One poor fellow had\\nhis coat dragged from his back and torn into a thousand souvenirs.\\n\\nThe restaurants of Florence are those of a city where the natives\\nare thrifty and the visitors dine in hotels. There is one expensive\\nhigh-class house, in the Via Tornabuoni -- Doney e Nipoti or Doney\\net Neveux -- where the cooking is Franco-Italian, and the Chianti and\\nwines are dear beyond belief, and the venerable waiters move with a\\ndeliberation which can drive a hungry man -- and one is always hungry\\nin this fine Tuscan air -- to despair. I like better the excellent\\nold-fashioned purely Italian food and Chianti and speed at Bonciani's\\nin the Via de Panzani, close to the station. These twain are the\\nbest. But it is more interesting to go to the huge Gambrinus in\\nthe Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele, because so much is going on all the\\ntime. One curious Florentine habit is quickly discovered and resented\\nby the stranger who frequents a restaurant, and that is the system of\\nchanging waiters from one set of tables to another; so that whereas\\nin London and Paris the wise diner is true to a corner because it\\ncarries the same service with it, in Florence he must follow the\\nservice. But if the restaurants have odd ways, and a limited range of\\ndishes and those not very interesting, they make up for it by being\\nastonishingly quick. Things are cooked almost miraculously.\\n\\nThe Florentines eat little. But greediness is not an Italian fault. No\\ngreedy people would have a five-syllabled word for waiter.\\n\\nContinuing along the Via dell' Arcivescovado, which after the Piazza\\nbecomes the Via Celimana, we come to that very beautiful structure\\nthe Mercato Nuovo, which, however, is not so wonderfully new, having\\nbeen built as long ago as 1547-1551. Its columns and arched roof are\\nexquisitely proportioned. As a market it seems to be a poor affair,\\nthe chief commodity being straw hats. For the principal food market one\\nhas to go to the Via d'Ariento, near S. Lorenzo, and this is, I think,\\nwell worth doing early in the morning. Lovers of Hans Andersen go to\\nthe Mercato Nuovo to see the famous bronze boar (or \\\"metal pig,\\\" as it\\nwas called in the translation on which I was brought up) that stands\\nhere, on whose back the little street boy had such adventures. The\\nboar himself was the work of Pietro Tacca (1586-1650), a copy from\\nan ancient marble original, now in the Uffizi, at the top of the\\nentrance stairs; but the pedestal with its collection of creeping\\nthings is modern. The Florentines who stand in the market niches are\\nBernardo Cennini, a goldsmith and one of Ghiberti's assistants, who\\nintroduced printing into Florence in 1471 and began with an edition of\\nVirgil; Giovanni Villani, who was the city's first serious historian,\\nbeginning in 1300 and continuing till his death in 1348; and Michele\\nLando, the wool-carder, who on July 22nd, 1378, at the head of a mob,\\noverturned the power of the Signory.\\n\\nBy continuing straight on we should come to that crowded and fussy\\nlittle street which crosses the river by the Ponte Vecchio and\\neventually becomes the Roman way; but let us instead turn to the\\nright this side of the market, down the Via Porta Rossa, because\\nhere is the Palazzo Davanzati, which has a profound interest to\\nlovers of the Florentine past in that it has been restored exactly\\nto its ancient state when Pope Eugenius IV lodged here, and has been\\nfilled with fourteenth and fifteenth century furniture. In those days\\nit was the home of the Davizza family. The Davanzati bought it late\\nin the sixteenth century and retained it until 1838. In 1904 it was\\nbought by Professor Elia Volpi, who restored its ancient conditions\\nand presented it to the city as a permanent monument of the past.\\n\\nHere we see a mediaeval Florentine palace precisely as it was when its\\nFlorentine owner lived his uncomfortable life there. For say what one\\nmay, there is no question that life must have been uncomfortable. In\\nearly and late summer, when the weather was fine and warm, these\\nstone floors and continuous draughts may have been solacing; but in\\nwinter and early spring, when Florentine weather can be so bitterly\\nhostile, what then? That there was a big fire we know by the smoky\\ncondition of Michelozzo's charming frieze on the chimney piece; but\\nthe room -- I refer to that on the first floor -- is so vast that this\\nfire can have done little for any one but an immediate vis-\\u00e0-vis;\\nand the room, moreover, was between the open world on the one side,\\nand the open court (now roofed in with glass) on the other, with\\nsuch additional opportunities for draughts as the four trap-doors\\nin the floor offered. It was through these traps that the stone\\ncannon-balls still stacked in the window seats were dropped, or a few\\ngallons of boiling oil poured, whenever the city or a faction of it\\nturned against the householder. Not comfortable, you see, at least\\nnot in our northern sense of the word, although to the hardy frugal\\nFlorentine it may have seemed a haven of luxury.\\n\\nThe furniture of the salon is simple and sparse and very hard. A bust\\nhere, a picture there, a coloured plate, a crucifix, and a Madonna\\nand Child in a niche: that was all the decoration save tapestry. An\\nhour glass, a pepper mill, a compass, an inkstand, stand for utility,\\nand quaint and twisted musical instruments and a backgammon board\\nfor beguilement.\\n\\nIn the salle-\\u00e0-manger adjoining is less light, and here also is\\na symbol of Florentine unrest in the shape of a hole in the wall\\n(beneath the niche which holds the Madonna and Child) through which\\nthe advancing foe, who had successfully avoided the cannon balls\\nand the oil, might be prodded with lances, or even fired at. The\\nnext room is the kitchen, curiously far from the well, the opening\\nto which is in the salon, and then a bedroom (with some guns in it)\\nand smaller rooms gained from the central court.\\n\\nThe rest of the building is the same -- a series of self-contained\\nflats, but all dipping for water from the same shaft and all depending\\nanxiously upon the success of the first floor with invaders. At the\\ntop is a beautiful loggia with Florence beneath it.\\n\\nThe odd thing to remember is that for the poor of Florence, who now\\ninhabit houses of the same age as the Davanzati palace, the conditions\\nare almost as they were in the fifteenth century. A few changes have\\ncome in, but hardly any. Myriads of the tenements have no water laid\\non: it must still be pulled up in buckets exactly as here. Indeed you\\nmay often see the top floor at work in this way; and there is a row\\nof houses on the left of the road to the Certosa, a little way out\\nof Florence, with a most elaborate network of bucket ropes over many\\ngardens to one well. Similarly one sees the occupants of the higher\\nfloors drawing vegetables and bread in baskets from the street and\\nlowering the money for them. The postman delivers letters in this\\nway, too. Again, one of the survivals of the Davanzati to which the\\ncustodian draws attention is the rain-water pipe, like a long bamboo,\\ndown the wall of the court; but one has but to walk along the Via\\nLambertesca, between the Uffizi and the Via Por S. Maria, and peer\\ninto the alleys, to see that these pipes are common enough yet.\\n\\nIn fact, directly one leaves the big streets Florence is still\\nfifteenth century. Less colour in the costumes, and a few anachronisms,\\nsuch as gas or electric light, posters, newspapers, cigarettes, and\\nbicycles, which dart like dragon flies (every Florentine cyclist\\nbeing a trick cyclist); but for the rest there is no change. The\\nbusiness of life has not altered; the same food is eaten, the same\\nvessels contain it, the same fire cooks it, the same red wine is\\nmade from the same grapes in the same vineyards, the same language\\n(almost) is spoken. The babies are christened at the same font,\\nthe parents visit the same churches. Similarly the handicrafts can\\nhave altered little. The coppersmith, the blacksmith, the cobbler,\\nthe woodcarver, the goldsmiths in their yellow smocks, must be just\\nas they were, and certainly the cellars and caverns under the big\\nhouses in which they work have not changed. Where the change is,\\nis among the better-to-do, the rich, and in the government. For no\\nlonger is a man afraid to talk freely of politics; no longer does he\\nshudder as he passes the Bargello; no longer is the name of Medici\\non his lips. Everything else is practically as it was.\\n\\nThe Via Porta Rossa runs to the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0, the church of\\nS. Trinit\\u00e0 being our destination. For here are some interesting\\nfrescoes. First, however, let us look at the sculpture: a very\\nbeautiful altar by Benedetto da Rovezzano in the fifth chapel of the\\nright aisle; a monument by Luca della Robbia to one of the archbishops\\nof Fiesole, once in S. Pancrazio (which is now a tobacco factory)\\nin the Via della Spada and brought here for safe keeping -- a beautiful\\nexample of Luca's genius, not only as a modeller but also as a very\\ntreasury of pretty thoughts, for the border of flowers and leaves is\\nbeyond praise delightful. The best green in Florence (after Nature's,\\nwhich is seen through so many doorways and which splashes over so\\nmany white walls and mingles with gay fruits in so many shops) is here.\\n\\nIn the fifth chapel of the left aisle is a Magdalen carved in wood\\nby Desiderio da Settignano and finished by Benedetto da Maiano;\\nwhile S. Trinit\\u00e0 now possesses, but shows only on Good Friday,\\nthe very crucifix from S. Miniato which bowed down and blessed\\nS. Gualberto. The porphyry tombs of the Sassetti, in the chapel of\\nthat family, by Giuliano di Sangallo, are magnificent.\\n\\nIt is in the Sassetti chapel that we find the Ghirlandaio frescoes\\nof scenes in the life of S. Francis which bring so many strangers\\nto this church. The painting which depicts S. Francis receiving\\nthe charter from the Emperor Honorius is interesting both for its\\nhistory and its painting; for it contains a valuable record of what\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio and Loggia de' Lanzi were like in 1485, and also\\nmany portraits: among them Lorenzo the Magnificent, on the extreme\\nright holding out his hand: Poliziano, tutor of the Medici boys,\\ncoming first up the stairs; and on the extreme left very probably\\nVerrocchio, one of Ghirlandaio's favourite painters. We find old\\nFlorence again in the very attractive picture of the resuscitation\\nof the nice little girl in violet, a daughter of the Spini family,\\nwho fell from a window of the Spini palace (as we see in the distance\\non the left, this being one of the old synchronized scenes) and was\\nbrought to life by S. Francis, who chanced to be flying by. The\\nscene is intensely local: just outside the church, looking along\\nwhat is now the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0 and the old Trinit\\u00e0 bridge. The\\nSpini palace is still there, but is now called the Ferroni, and it\\naccommodates no longer Florentine aristocrats but consuls and bank\\nclerks. Among the portraits in the fresco are noble friends of the\\nSpini family -- Albrizzi, Acciaioli, Strozzi and so forth. The little\\ngirl is very quaint and perfectly ready to take up once more the\\nthreads of her life. How long she lived this second time and what\\nbecame of her I have not been able to discover. Her tiny sister,\\nbehind the bier, is even quainter. On the left is a little group\\nof the comely Florentine ladies in whom Ghirlandaio so delighted,\\ntall and serene, with a few youths among them.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that Ghirlandaio in his S. Trinit\\u00e0 frescoes\\nand Benedetto da Maiano in his S. Croce pulpit reliefs chose exactly\\nthe same scenes in the life of S. Francis: interesting because\\nwhen Ghirlandaio was painting frescoes at San Gimignano in 1475,\\nBenedetto was at work on the altar for the same church of S. Fina,\\nand they were friends. Where Ghirlandaio and Giotto, also in S. Croce,\\nalso coincide in choice of subject some interesting comparisons may\\nbe made, all to the advantage of Giotto in spiritual feeling and\\nunsophisticated charm, but by no means to Ghirlandaio's detriment\\nas a fascinating historian in colour. In the scene of the death of\\nS. Francis we find Ghirlandaio and Giotto again on the same ground,\\nand here it is probable that the later painter went to the earlier\\nfor inspiration; for he has followed Giotto in the fine thought that\\nmakes one of the attendant brothers glance up as though at the saint's\\nascending spirit. It is remarkable how, with every picture that one\\nsees, Giotto's completeness of equipment as a religious painter becomes\\nmore marked. His hand may have been ignorant of many masterly devices\\nfor which the time was not ripe; but his head and heart knew all.\\n\\nThe patriarchs in the spandrels of the choir are by Ghirlandaio's\\nmaster, Alessio Baldovinetti, of whom I said something in the chapter\\non S. Maria Novella. They once more testify to this painter's charm\\nand brilliance. Almost more than that of any other does one regret the\\nscarcity of his work. It was fitting that he should have painted the\\nchoir, for his name-saint, S. Alessio, guards the fa\\u00e7ade of the church.\\n\\nThe column opposite the church came from the baths of Caracalla and\\nwas set up by Cosimo I, upon the attainment of his life-long ambition\\nof a grand-dukeship and a crown. The figure at the top is Justice.\\n\\nS. Trinit\\u00e0 is a good starting-point for the leisurely examination of\\nthe older and narrower streets, an occupation which so many visitors\\nto Florence prefer to the study of picture galleries and churches. And\\nperhaps rightly. In no city can they carry on their researches with\\nsuch ease, for Florence is incurious about them. Either the Florentines\\nare too much engrossed in their own affairs or the peering foreigner\\nhas become too familiar an object to merit notice, but one may drift\\nabout even in the narrowest alleys beside the Arno, east and west,\\nand attract few eyes. And the city here is at its most romantic:\\nbetween the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0 and the Via Por S. Maria, all about\\nthe Borgo SS. Apostoli.\\n\\nWe have just been discussing Benedetto da Maiano the sculptor. If we\\nturn to the left on leaving S. Trinit\\u00e0, instead of losing ourselves in\\nthe little streets, we are in the Via Tornabuoni, where the best shops\\nare and American is the prevailing language. We shall soon come, on the\\nright, to an example of Benedetto's work as an architect, for the first\\ndraft of the famous Palazzo Strozzi, the four-square fortress-home\\nwhich Filippo Strozzi began for himself in 1489, was his. Benedetto\\ncontinued the work until his death in 1507, when Cronaca, who built\\nthe great hall in the Palazzo Vecchio, took it over and added the\\nfamous cornice. The iron lantern and other smithwork were by Lorenzo\\nthe Magnificent's sardonic friend, \\\"Il Caparro,\\\" of the Sign of the\\nBurning Books, of whom I wrote in the chapter on the Medici palace.\\n\\nThe first mistress of the Strozzi palace was Clarice Strozzi,\\nn\\u00e9e Clarice de' Medici, the daughter of Piero, son of Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent. She was born in 1493 and married Filippo Strozzi the\\nyounger in 1508, during the family's second period of exile. They\\nthen lived at Rome, but were allowed to return to Florence in\\n1510. Clarice's chief title to fame is her proud outburst when she\\nturned Ippolito and Alessandro out of the Medici palace. She died\\nin 1528 and was buried in S. Maria Novella. The unfortunate Filippo\\nmet his end nine years later in the Boboli fortezza, which his money\\nhad helped to build and in which he was imprisoned for his share in\\na conspiracy against Cosimo I. Cosimo confiscated the palace and all\\nStrozzi's other possessions, but later made some restitution. To-day\\nthe family occupy the upper part of their famous imperishable home,\\nand beneath there is an exhibition of pictures and antiquities for\\nsale. No private individual, whatever his wealth or ambition, will\\nprobably ever again succeed in building a house half so strong or\\nnoble as this.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nThe Pitti\\n\\nLuca Pitti's pride -- Preliminary caution -- A terrace view -- A\\ncollection but not a gallery -- The personally-conducted -- Giorgione\\nthe superb -- Sustermans -- The \\\"Madonna del Granduca\\\" -- The \\\"Madonna\\ndella Sedia\\\" -- From Cimabue to Raphael -- Andrea del Sarto -- Two Popes\\nand a bastard -- The ill-fated Ippolito -- The National Gallery -- Royal\\napartments -- \\\"Pallas Subduing the Centaur\\\" -- The Boboli Gardens.\\n\\nThe Pitti approached from the Via Guicciardini is far liker a prison\\nthan a palace. It was commissioned by Luca Pitti, one of the proudest\\nand richest of the rivals of the Medici, in 1441. Cosimo de' Medici,\\nas we have seen, had rejected Brunelleschi's plans for a palazzo\\nas being too pretentious and gone instead to his friend Michelozzo\\nfor something that externally at any rate was more modest; Pitti,\\nwhose one ambition was to exceed Cosimo in power, popularity, and\\nvisible wealth, deliberately chose Brunelleschi, and gave him carte\\nblanche to make the most magnificent mansion possible. Pitti, however,\\nplotting against Cosimo's son Piero, was frustrated and condemned to\\ndeath; and although Piero obtained his pardon he lost all his friends\\nand passed into utter disrespect in the city. Meanwhile his palace\\nremained unfinished and neglected, and continued so for a century,\\nwhen it was acquired by the Grand Duchess Eleanor of Toledo, the wife\\nof Cosimo I, who though she saw only the beginnings of its splendours\\nlived there awhile and there brought up her doomed brood. Eleanor's\\narchitect -- or rather Cosimo's, for though the Grand Duchess paid,\\nthe Grand Duke controlled -- was Ammanati, the designer of the Neptune\\nfountain in the Piazza della Signoria. Other important additions were\\nmade later. The last Medicean Grand Duke to occupy the Pitti was Gian\\nGastone, a bizarre detrimental, whose head, in a monstrous wig, may\\nbe seen at the top of the stairs leading to the Uffizi gallery. He\\ndied in 1737.\\n\\nAs I have said in chapter VIII, it was by the will of Gian Gastone's\\nsister, widow of the Elector Palatine, who died in 1743, that the\\nMedicean collections became the property of the Florentines. This\\nbequest did not, however, prevent the migration of many of the\\nbest pictures to Paris under Napoleon, but after Waterloo they came\\nback. The Pitti continued to be the home of princes after Gian Gastone\\nquitted a world which he found strange and made more so; but they were\\nnot of the Medici blood. It is now a residence of the royal family.\\n\\nThe first thing to do if by evil chance one enters the Pitti by the\\ncovered way from the Uffizi is, just before emerging into the palace,\\nto avoid the room where copies of pictures are sold, for not only is\\nit a very catacomb of headache, from the fresh paint, but the copies\\nare in themselves horrible and lead to disquieting reflections on\\nthe subject of sweated labour. The next thing to do, on at last\\nemerging, is to walk out on the roof from the little room at the\\ntop of the stairs, and get a supply of fresh air for the gallery,\\nand see Florence, which is very beautiful from here. Looking over\\nthe city one notices that the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio is almost\\nmore dominating than the Duomo, the work of the same architect who\\nbegan this palace. Between the two is Fiesole. The Signoria tower is,\\nas I say, the highest. Then the Duomo. Then Giotto's Campanile. The\\nBargello is hidden, but the graceful Badia tower is seen; also the\\nlittle white Baptistery roof with its lantern just showing. From the\\nfortezza come the sounds of drums and bugles.\\n\\nReturning from this terrace we skirt a vast porphyry basin and reach\\nthe top landing of the stairs (which was, I presume, once a loggia)\\nwhere there is a very charming marble fountain; and from this we\\nenter the first room of the gallery. The Pitti walls are so congested\\nand so many of the pictures so difficult to see, that I propose to\\nrefer only to those which, after a series of visits, seem to me the\\nabsolute best. Let me hasten to say that to visit the Pitti gallery\\non any but a really bright day is folly. The great windows (which\\nwere to be larger than Cosimo de' Medici's doors) are excellent to\\nlook out of, but the rooms are so crowded with paintings on walls\\nand ceilings, and the curtains are so absorbent of light, that unless\\nthere is sunshine one gropes in gloom. The only pictures in short that\\nare properly visible are those on screens or hinges; and these are,\\nfortunately almost without exception, the best. The Pitti rooms were\\nnever made for pictures at all, and it is really absurd that so many\\nbeautiful things should be massed here without reasonable lighting.\\n\\nThe Pitti also is always crowded. The Uffizi is never crowded; the\\nAccademia is always comfortable; the Bargello is sparsely attended. But\\nthe Pitti is normally congested, not only by individuals but by flocks,\\nwhose guides, speaking broken English, and sometimes broken American,\\nlead from room to room. I need hardly say that they form the tightest\\nknots before the works of Raphael. All this is proper enough, of\\ncourse, but it serves to render the Pitti a difficult gallery rightly\\nto study pictures in.\\n\\nIn the first chapter on the Uffizi I have said how simple it is,\\nin the Pitti, to name the best picture of all, and how difficult in\\nmost galleries. But the Pitti has one particular jewel which throws\\neverything into the background: the work not of a Florentine but of a\\nVenetian: \\\"The Concert\\\" of Giorgione, which stands on an easel in the\\nSala di Marte. It is true that modern criticism has doubted the\\nlightness of the ascription, and many critics, whose one idea seems\\nto be to deprive Giorgione of any pictures at all, leaving him but\\na glorious name without anything to account for it, call it an early\\nTitian; but this need not trouble us. There the picture is, and never\\ndo I think to see anything more satisfying. Piece by piece, it is\\nnot more than fine rich painting, but as a whole it is impressive and\\nmysterious and enchanting. Pater compares the effect of it to music;\\nand he is right.\\n\\nThe Sala dell' Iliade (the name of each room refers always to the\\nceiling painting, which, however, one quite easily forgets to look at)\\nis chiefly notable for the Raphael just inside the door: \\\"La Donna\\nGravida,\\\" No. 229, one of his more realistic works, with bolder colour\\nthan usual and harder treatment; rather like the picture that has\\nbeen made its pendant, No. 224, an \\\"Incognita\\\" by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio,\\nvery firmly painted, but harder still. Between them is the first of the\\nmany Pitti Andrea del Sartos: No. 225, an \\\"Assumption of the Madonna,\\\"\\nopposite a similar work from the same brush, neither containing quite\\nthe finest traits of this artist. But the youth with outstretched hand\\nat the tomb is nobly done. No. 265, \\\"Principe Mathias de' Medici,\\\"\\nis a good bold Sustermans, but No. 190, on the opposite wall, is a\\nfar better -- a most charming work representing the Crown Prince of\\nDenmark, son of Frederick III. Justus Sustermans, who has so many\\nportraits here and elsewhere in Florence, was a Belgian, born in 1597,\\nwho settled in Florence as a portrait painter to Cosimo III. Van Dyck\\ngreatly admired his work and painted him. He died at Florence in 1681.\\n\\nNo. 208, a \\\"Virgin Enthroned,\\\" by Fra Bartolommeo, is from S. Marco,\\nand it had better have been painted on the wall there, like the Fra\\nAngelicos, and then the convent would have it still. The Child is very\\nattractive, as almost always in this artist's work, but the picture\\nas a whole has grown rather dingy. By the window is a Velasquez, the\\nfirst we have seen in Florence, a little Philip IV on his prancing\\nsteed, rather too small for its subject, but very interesting here\\namong the Italians.\\n\\nIn the next large room -- the Sala di Saturno -- we come again to\\nRaphael, who is indeed the chief master of the Pitti, his exquisite\\n\\\"Madonna del Granduca\\\" being just to the left of the door. Here we\\nhave the simplest colouring and perfect sweetness, and such serenity\\nof mastery as must be the despair of the copyists, who, however,\\nnever cease attempting it. The only defect is a little clumsiness\\nin the Madonna's hand. The picture was lost for two centuries and it\\nthen changed owners for twelve crowns, the seller being a poor woman\\nand the buyer a bookseller. The bookseller found a ready purchaser\\nin the director of the Grand Duke Ferdinand III's gallery, and the\\nGrand Duke so esteemed it that he carried it with him on all his\\njourneys, just as Sir George Beaumont, the English connoisseur, never\\ntravelled without a favourite Claude. Hence its name. Another Andrea\\ndel Sarto, the \\\"Disputa sulla Trinita,\\\" No. 172, is close by, nobly\\ndrawn but again not of his absolute best, and then five more Raphaels\\nor putative Raphaels -- No. 171, Tommaso Inghirami; No. 61, Angelo Doni,\\nthe collector and the friend of artists, for whom Michelangelo painted\\nhis \\\"Holy Family\\\" in the Uffizi; No. 59, Maddalena Doni; and above\\nall No. 174, \\\"The Vision of Ezekiel,\\\" that little great picture,\\nso strong and spirited, and -- to coin a word -- Sixtinish. All these,\\nI may say, are questioned by experts; but some very fine hand is\\nto be seen in them any way. Over the \\\"Ezekiel\\\" is still another,\\nNo. 165, the \\\"Madonna detta del Baldacchino,\\\" which is so much better\\nin the photographs. Next this group -- No. 164 -- we find Raphael's\\nfriend Perugino with an Entombment, but it lacks his divine glow;\\nand above it a soft and mellow and easy Andrea del Sarto, No. 163,\\nwhich ought to be in a church rather than here. A better Perugino\\nis No. 42, which has all his sweetness, but to call it the Magdalen\\nis surely wrong; and close by it a rather formal Fra Bartolommeo,\\nNo. 159, \\\"Gesu Resuscitato,\\\" from the church of SS. Annunziata, in\\nwhich once again the babies who hold the circular landscape are the\\nbest part. After another doubtful Raphael -- the sly Cardinal Divizio\\nda Bibbiena, No. 158 -- let us look at an unquestioned one, No. 151,\\nthe most popular picture in Florence, if not the whole world, Raphael's\\n\\\"Madonna della Sedia,\\\" that beautiful rich scene of maternal tenderness\\nand infantine peace. Personally I do not find myself often under\\nRaphael's spell; but here he conquers. The Madonna again is without\\nenough expression, but her arms are right, and the Child is right,\\nand the colour is so rich, almost Venetian in that odd way in which\\nRaphael now and then could suggest Venice.\\n\\nIt is interesting to compare Raphael's two famous Madonnas in this\\nroom: this one belonging to his Roman period and the other, opposite\\nit, to Florence, with the differences so marked. For by the time he\\npainted this he knew more of life and human affection. This picture,\\nI suppose, might be called the consummation of Renaissance painting in\\nfullest bloom: the latest triumph of that impulse. I do not say it is\\nthe best; but it may be called a crown on the whole movement both in\\nsubject and treatment. Think of the gulf between the Cimabue Madonna\\nand the Giotto Madonna, side by side, which we saw in the Accademia,\\nand this. With so many vivid sympathies Giotto must have wanted with\\nall his soul to make the mother motherly and the child childlike; but\\nthe time was not yet; his hand was neither free nor fit. Between Giotto\\nand Raphael had to come many things before such treatment as this was\\npossible; most of all, I think, Luca della Robbia had to come between,\\nfor he was the most valuable reconciler of God and man of them all. He\\nwas the first to bring a tender humanity into the Church, the first\\nto know that a mother's fingers, holding a baby, sink into its soft\\nlittle body. Without Luca I doubt if the \\\"Madonna della Sedia\\\" could\\nbe the idyll of protective solicitude and loving pride that it is.\\n\\nThe Sala di Giove brings us to Venetian painting indeed, and glorious\\npainting too, for next the door is Titian's \\\"Bella,\\\" No. 18, the lady\\nin the peacock-blue dress with purple sleeves, all richly embroidered\\nin gold, whom to see once is to remember for ever. On the other side of\\nthe door is Andrea's brilliant \\\"S. John the Baptist as a Boy,\\\" No. 272,\\nand then the noblest Fra Bartolommeo here, a Deposition, No. 64, not\\ngood in colour, but superbly drawn and pitiful. In this room also is\\nthe monk's great spirited figure of S. Marco, for the convent of that\\nname. Between them is a Tintoretto, No. 131, Vincenzo Zeino, one of his\\nruddy old men, with a glimpse of Venice, under an angry sky, through\\nthe window. Over the door, No. 124, is an Annunciation by Andrea,\\nwith a slight variation in it, for two angels accompany that one who\\nbrings the news, and the announcement is made from the right instead\\nof the left, while the incident is being watched by some people on the\\nterrace over a classical portico. A greater Andrea hangs next: No. 123,\\nthe Madonna in Glory, fine but rather formal, and, like all Andrea's\\nwork, hall-marked by its woman type. The other notable pictures are\\nRaphael's Fornarina, No. 245, which is far more Venetian than the\\n\\\"Madonna della Sedia,\\\" and has been given to Sebastian del Piombo;\\nand the Venetian group on the right of the door, which is not only\\ninteresting for its own charm but as being a foretaste of the superb\\nand glorious Giorgione in the Sala di Marte, which we now enter.\\n\\nHere we find a Rembrandt, No. 16, an old man: age and dignity emerging\\ngolden from the gloom; and as a pendant a portrait, with somewhat\\nsimilar characteristics, but softer, by Tintoretto, No. 83. Between\\nthem is a prosperous, ruddy group of scholars by Rubens, who has\\nplaced a vase of tulips before the bust of Seneca. And we find Rubens\\nagain with a sprawling, brilliant feat entitled \\\"The Consequences\\nof War,\\\" but what those consequences are, beyond nakedness, one\\nhas difficulty in discerning. Raphael's Holy Family, No. 94 (also\\nknown as the \\\"Madonna dell' Impannata\\\"), next it might be called the\\nperfection of drawing without feeling. The authorities consider it a\\nschool piece: that is to say, chiefly the work of his imitators. The\\nvivacity of the Child's face is very remarkable. The best Andrea is\\nin this room -- a Holy Family, No. 81, which gets sweeter and simpler\\nand richer with every glance. Other Andreas are here too, notably on\\nthe right of the further door a sweet mother and sprawling, vigorous\\nChild. But every Andrea that I see makes me think more highly of the\\n\\\"Madonna della Sacco,\\\" in the cloisters of SS. Annunziata. Van Dyck,\\nwho painted much in Italy before settling down at the English court,\\nwe find in this room with a masterly full-length seated portrait of\\nan astute cardinal. But the room's greatest glory, as I have said,\\nis the Giorgione on the easel.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Apollo, at the right of the door as we enter, is\\nAndrea's portrait of himself, a serious and mysterious face shining\\nout of darkness, and below it is Titian's golden Magdalen, No. 67,\\nthe same ripe creature that we saw at the Uffizi posing as Flora,\\nagain diffusing Venetian light. On the other side of the door we find,\\nfor the first time in Florence, Murillo, who has two groups of the\\nMadonna and Child on this wall, the better being No. 63, which is both\\nsweet and masterly. In No. 56 the Child becomes a pretty Spanish boy\\nplaying with a rosary, and in both He has a faint nimbus instead of\\nthe halo to which we are accustomed. On the same wall is another fine\\nAndrea, who is most lavishly represented in this gallery, No. 58,\\na Deposition, all gentle melancholy rather than grief. The kneeling\\ngirl is very beautiful.\\n\\nFinally there are Van Dyck's very charming portrait of Charles\\nI of England and Henrietta, a most deft and distinguished work,\\nand Raphael's famous portrait of Leo X with two companions: rather\\ndingy, and too like three persons set for the camera, but powerful and\\ndeeply interesting to us, because here we see the first Medici pope,\\nLeo X, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni, who gave Michelangelo the\\ncommission for the Medici tombs and the new Sacristy of S. Lorenzo;\\nand in the young man on the Pope's right hand we see none other\\nthan Giulio, natural son of Giuliano de' Medici, Lorenzo's brother,\\nwho afterwards became Pope as Clement VII. It was he who laid siege\\nto Florence when Michelangelo was called upon to fortify it; and it\\nwas during his pontificate that Henry VIII threw off the shackles\\nof Rome and became the Defender of the Faith. Himself a bastard,\\nGiulio became the father of the base-born Alessandro of Urbino,\\nfirst Duke of Florence, who, after procuring the death of Ippolito\\nand living a life of horrible excess, was himself murdered by his\\ncousin Lorenzino in order to rid Florence of her worst tyrant. In\\nhis portrait Leo X has an illuminated missal and a magnifying glass,\\nas indication of his scholarly tastes. That he was also a good liver\\nhis form and features testify.\\n\\nOf this picture an interesting story is told. After the battle of\\nPavia, in 1525, Clement VII wishing to be friendly with the Marquis\\nof Gonzaga, a powerful ally of the Emperor Charles V, asked him what\\nhe could do for him, and Gonzaga expressed a wish for the portrait\\nof Leo X, then in the Medici palace. Clement complied, but wishing\\nto retain at any rate a semblance of the original, directed that the\\npicture should be copied, and Andrea del Sarto was chosen for that\\ntask. The copy turned out to be so close that Gonzaga never obtained\\nthe original at all.\\n\\nIn the next room -- the Sala di Venere, and the last room in the long\\nsuite -- we find another Raphael portrait, and another Pope, this time\\nJulius II, that Pontiff whose caprice and pride together rendered\\nnull and void and unhappy so many years of Michelangelo's life,\\nsince it was for him that the great Julian tomb, never completed, was\\ndesigned. A replica of this picture is in our National Gallery. Here\\nalso are a wistful and poignant John the Baptist by Dossi, No. 380;\\ntwo D\\u00fcrers -- an Adam and an Eve, very naked and primitive, facing\\neach other from opposite walls; and two Rubens landscapes not equal\\nto ours at Trafalgar Square, but spacious and lively. The gem of the\\nroom is a lovely Titian, No. 92, on an easel, a golden work of supreme\\nquietude and disguised power. The portrait is called sometimes the\\nDuke of Norfolk, sometimes the \\\"Young Englishman\\\".\\n\\nReturning to the first room -- the Sala of the Iliad -- we enter the Sala\\ndell' Educazione di Giove, and find on the left a little gipsy portrait\\nby Boccaccio Boccaccino (1497-1518) which has extraordinary charm:\\na grave, wistful, childish face in a blue handkerchief: quite a new\\nkind of picture here. I reproduce it in this volume, but it wants\\nits colour. For the rest, the room belongs to less-known and later\\nmen, in particular to Cristofano Allori (1577-1621), with his famous\\nJudith, reproduced in all the picture shops of Florence. This work is\\nno favourite of mine, but one cannot deny it power and richness. The\\nGuido Reni opposite, in which an affected fat actress poses as\\nCleopatra with the asp, is not, however, even tolerable.\\n\\nWe next pass, after a glance perhaps at the adjoining tapestry room\\non the left (where the bronze Cain and Abel are), the most elegant\\nbathroom imaginable, fit for anything rather than soap and splashes,\\nand come to the Sala di Ulisse and some good Venetian portraits:\\na bearded senator in a sable robe by Paolo Veronese, No. 216, and,\\nNo. 201, Titian's fine portrait of the ill-fated Ippolito de'\\nMedici, son of that Giuliano de' Medici, Duc de Nemours, whose\\ntomb by Michelangelo is at S. Lorenzo. This amiable young man was\\nbrought up by Leo X until the age of twelve, when the Pope died,\\nand the boy was sent to Florence to live at the Medici palace,\\nwith the base-born Alessandro, under the care of Cardinal Passerini,\\nwhere he remained until Clarice de' Strozzi ordered both the boys to\\nquit. In 1527 came the third expulsion of the Medici from Florence,\\nand Ippolito wandered about until Clement VII, the second Medici\\nPope, was in Rome, after the sack, and, joining him there, he was,\\nagainst his will, made a cardinal, and sent to Hungary: Clement's idea\\nbeing to establish Alessandro (his natural son) as Duke of Florence,\\nand squeeze Ippolito, the rightful heir, out. This, Clement succeeded\\nin doing, and the repulsive and squalid-minded Alessandro -- known as\\nthe Mule -- was installed. Ippolito, in whom this proceeding caused\\ndeep grief, settled in Bologna and took to scholarship, among other\\ntasks translating part of the Aeneid into Italian blank verse;\\nbut when Clement died and thus liberated Rome from a vile tyranny,\\nhe was with him and protected his corpse from the angry mob. That\\nwas in 1534, when Ippolito was twenty-seven. In the following year\\na number of exiles from Florence who could not endure Alessandro's\\noffensive ways, or had been forced by him to fly, decided to appeal\\nto the Emperor Charles V for assistance against such a contemptible\\nruler; and Ippolito headed the mission; but before he could reach the\\nEmperor an emissary of Alessandro's succeeded in poisoning him. Such\\nwas Ippolito de' Medici, grandson of the great Lorenzo, whom Titian\\npainted, probably when he was in Bologna, in 1533 or 1534.\\n\\nThis room also contains a nice little open decorative scene -- like a\\nsketch for a fresco -- of the Death of Lucrezia, No. 388, attributed\\nto the School of Botticelli, and above it a good Royal Academy Andrea\\ndel Sarto.\\n\\nThe next is the best of these small rooms -- the Sala of\\nPrometheus -- where on Sundays most people spend their time in\\nastonishment over the inlaid tables, but where Tuscan art also is\\nvery beautiful. The most famous picture is, I suppose, the circular\\nFilippino Lippi, No. 343, but although the lively background is\\nvery entertaining and the Virgin most wonderfully painted, the Child\\nis a serious blemish. The next favourite, if not the first, is the\\nPerugino on the easel -- No. 219 -- one of his loveliest small pictures,\\nwith an evening glow among the Apennines such as no other painter\\ncould capture. Other fine works here are the Fra Bartolommeo, No. 256,\\nover the door, a Holy Family, very pretty and characteristic, and his\\n\\\"Ecce Homo,\\\" next it; the adorable circular Botticini (as the catalogue\\ncalls it, although the photographers waver between Botticelli and\\nFilippino Lippi), No. 347, with its myriad roses and children with\\ntheir little folded hands and the Mother and Child diffusing happy\\nsweetness, which, if only it were a little less painty, would be one\\nof the chief magnets of the gallery.\\n\\nHereabout are many Botticelli school pictures, chief of these the\\ncurious girl, called foolishly \\\"La Bella Simonetta,\\\" which Mr. Berenson\\nattributes to that unknown disciple of Botticelli to whom he has given\\nthe charming name of Amico di Sandro. This study in browns, yellow,\\nand grey always has its public. Other popular Botticelli derivatives\\nare Nos. 348 and 357. Look also at the sly and curious woman (No. 102),\\nnear the window, by Ubertini, a new artist here; and the pretty Jacopo\\ndel Sellaio, No. 364; a finely drawn S. Sebastian by Pollaiuolo;\\nthe Holy Family by Jacopo di Boateri, No. 362, with very pleasant\\ncolouring; No. 140, the \\\"Incognita,\\\" which people used to think was\\nby Leonardo -- for some reason difficult to understand except on the\\nprinciple of making the wish father to the thought -- and is now given\\nto Bugiardini; and lastly a rich and comely example of Lombardy art,\\nNo. 299.\\n\\nFrom this room we will enter first the Corridio delle Colonne where\\nCardinal Leopoldo de' Medici's miniature portraits are hung, all\\nremarkable and some superb, but unfortunately not named, together\\nwith a few larger works, all very interesting. That Young Goldsmith,\\nNo. 207, which used to be given to Leonardo but is now Ridolfo\\nGhirlandaio's, is here; a Franciabigio, No. 43; a questioned Raphael,\\nNo. 44; a fine and sensitive head of one of the Gonzaga family by\\nMantegna, No. 375; the coarse head of Giovanni Bentivoglio by da\\nCosta, No. 376; and a Pollaiuolo, No. 370, S. Jerome, whose fine rapt\\ncountenance is beautifully drawn.\\n\\nIn the Sala della Giustizia we come again to the Venetians: a noble\\nPiombo, No. 409; the fine Aretino and Tommaso Mosti by Titian;\\nTintoretto's portrait of a man, No. 410; and two good Moronis. But\\nI am not sure that Dosso Dossi's \\\"Nymph and Satyr\\\" on the easel is\\nnot the most remarkable achievement here. I do not, however, care\\ngreatly for it.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Flora we find some interesting Andreas; a beautiful\\nportrait by Puligo, No. 184; and Giulio Romano's famous frieze of\\ndancers. Also a fine portrait by Allori, No. 72. The end room of all\\nis notable for a Ruysdael.\\n\\nFinally there is the Sala del Poccetti, out of the Sala di Prometeo,\\nwhich, together with the preceding two rooms that I have described,\\nhas lately been rearranged. Here now is the hard but masterly Holy\\nFamily of Bronzino, who has an enormous amount of work in Florence,\\nchiefly Medicean portraits, but nowhere, I think, reaches the level\\nof his \\\"Allegory\\\" in our National Gallery, or the portrait in the\\nTaylor collection sold at Christie's in 1912. Here also are four\\nrich Poussins; two typical Salvator Rosa landscapes and a battle\\npiece from the same hand; and, by some strange chance, a portrait\\nof Oliver Cromwell by Sir Peter Lely. But the stone table again wins\\nmost attention.\\n\\nAnd here, as we leave the last of the great picture collections of\\nFlorence, I would say how interesting it is to the returned visitor\\nto London to go quickly to the National Gallery and see how we\\ncompare with them. Florence is naturally far richer than we, but\\nalthough only now and then have we the advantage, we can valuably\\nsupplement in a great many cases. And the National Gallery keeps\\nup its quality throughout -- it does not suddenly fall to pieces as\\nthe Uffizi does. Thus, I doubt if Florence with all her Andreas\\nhas so exquisite a thing from his hand as our portrait of a \\\"Young\\nSculptor,\\\" so long called a portrait of the painter himself; and we\\nhave two Michelangelo paintings to the Uffizi's one. In Leonardo the\\nLouvre is of course far richer, even without the Gioconda, but we\\nhave at Burlington House the cartoon for the Louvre's S. Anne which\\nmay pair off with the Uffizi's unfinished Madonna, and we have also\\nat the National Gallery his finished \\\"Virgin of the Rocks,\\\" while\\nto Burlington House one must go too for Michelangelo's beautiful\\ntondo. In Piero di Cosimo we are more fortunate than the Uffizi; and\\nwe have Raphaels as important as those of the Pitti. We are strong\\ntoo in Perugino, Filippino Lippi, and Luca Signorelli, while when it\\ncomes to Piero della Francesca we lead absolutely. Our Verrocchio,\\nor School of Verrocchio, is a superb thing, while our Cimabue (from\\nS. Croce) has a quality of richness not excelled by any that I have\\nseen elsewhere. But in Botticelli Florence wins.\\n\\nThe Pitti palace contains also the apartments in which the King\\nand Queen of Italy reside when they visit Florence, which is not\\noften. Florence became the capital of Italy in 1865, on the day of\\nthe sixth anniversary of the birth of Dante. It remained the capital\\nuntil 1870, when Rome was chosen. The rooms are shown thrice a\\nweek, and are not, I think, worth the time that one must give to the\\nperambulation. Beyond this there is nothing to say, except that they\\nwould delight children. Visitors are hurried through in small bands,\\nand dallying is discouraged. Hence one is merely tantalized by the\\npresence of their greatest treasure, Botticelli's \\\"Pallas subduing\\nthe Centaur,\\\" painted to commemorate Lorenzo de' Medici's successful\\ndiplomatic mission to the King of Naples in 1480, to bring about\\nthe end of the war with Sixtus IV, the prime instigator of the Pazzi\\nConspiracy and the bitter enemy of Lorenzo in particular -- whose only\\nfault, as he drily expressed it, had been to \\\"escape being murdered\\nin the Cathedral\\\" -- and of all Tuscany in general. Botticelli, whom\\nwe have already seen as a Medicean allegorist, always ready with\\nhis glancing genius to extol and commend the virtues of that family,\\nhere makes the centaur typify war and oppression while the beautiful\\nfigure which is taming and subduing him by reason represents Pallas,\\nor the arts of peace, here identifiable with Lorenzo by the laurel\\nwreath and the pattern of her robe, which is composed of his private\\ncrest of diamond rings intertwined. This exquisite picture -- so rich\\nin colour and of such power and impressiveness -- ought to be removed\\nto an easel in the Pitti Gallery proper. The \\\"Madonna della Rosa,\\\"\\nby Botticelli or his School, is also here, and I had a moment before\\na very alluring Holbein. But my memory of this part of the palace is\\nmade up of gilt and tinsel and plush and candelabra, with two pieces\\nof furniture outstanding -- a blue and silver bed, and a dining table\\nrather larger than a lawn-tennis court.\\n\\nThe Boboli gardens, which climb the hill from the Pitti, are also\\nopened only on three afternoons a week. The panorama of Florence and\\nthe surrounding Apennines which one has from the Belvedere makes a\\nvisit worth while; but the gardens themselves are, from the English\\npoint of view, poor, save in extent and in the groves on the way to\\nthe stables (scuderie). Like all gardens where clipped walks are the\\nprincipal feature, they want people. They were made for people to\\nenjoy them, rather than for flowers to grow in, and at every turn\\nthere is a new and charming vista in a green frame.\\n\\nIt was from the Boboli hill-side before it was a garden that much\\nof the stone of Florence was quarried. With such stones so near it\\nis less to be wondered at that the buildings are what they are. And\\nyet it is wonderful too -- that these little inland Italian citizens\\nshould so have built their houses for all time. It proves them to\\nhave had great gifts of character. There is no such building any more.\\n\\nThe Grotto close to the Pitti entrance, which contains some of\\nMichelangelo's less remarkable \\\"Prisoners,\\\" intended for the great\\nJulian tomb, is so \\\"grottesque\\\" that the statues are almost lost, and\\naltogether it is rather an Old Rye House affair; and though Giovanni\\nda Bologna's fountain in the midst of a lake is very fine, I doubt if\\nthe walk is quite worth it. My advice rather is to climb at once to\\nthe top, at the back of the Pitti, by way of the amphitheatre where\\nthe gentlemen and ladies used to watch court pageants, and past that\\ningenious fountain above it, in which Neptune's trident itself spouts\\nwater, and rest in the pretty flower garden on the very summit of the\\nhill, among the lizards. There, seated on the wall, you may watch the\\npeasants at work in the vineyards, and the white oxen ploughing in\\nthe olive groves, in the valley between this hill and S. Miniato. In\\nspring the contrast between the greens of the crops and the silver\\ngrey of the olives is vivid and gladsome; in September, one may see\\nthe grapes being picked and piled into the barrels, immediately below,\\nand hear the squdge as the wooden pestle is driven into the purple\\nmass and the juice gushes out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nEnglish Poets in Florence\\n\\nCasa Guidi -- The Brownings -- Giotto's missing spire -- James Russell\\nLowell -- Lander's early life -- Fra Bartolommeo before Raphael -- The Tuscan\\ngardener -- The \\\"Villa Landor\\\" to-day -- Storms on the hillside -- Pastoral\\npoetry -- Italian memories in England -- The final outburst -- Last days\\nin Florence -- The old lion's beguilements -- The famous epitaph.\\n\\nOn a house in the Piazza S. Felice, obliquely facing the Pitti, with\\nwindows both in the Via Maggio and Via Mazzetta, is a tablet, placed\\nthere by grateful Florence, stating that it was the home of Robert\\nand of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and that her verse made a golden\\nring to link England to Italy. In other words, this is Casa Guidi.\\n\\nA third member of the family, Flush the spaniel, was also with them,\\nand they moved here in 1848, and it was here that Mrs. Browning\\ndied, in 1861. But it was not their first Florentine home, for in\\n1847 they had gone into rooms in the Via delle Belle Donne -- the\\nStreet of Beautiful Ladies -- whose name so fascinated Ruskin, near\\nS. Maria Novella. At Casa Guidi Browning wrote, among other poems,\\n\\\"Christinas Eve and Easter Day,\\\" \\\"The Statue and the Bust\\\" of which I\\nhave said something in chapter XIX, and the \\\"Old Pictures in Florence,\\\"\\nthat philosophic commentary on Vasari, which ends with the spirited\\nappeal for the crowning of Giotto's Campanile with the addition of\\nthe golden spire that its builder intended -- \\n\\n\\n Fine as the beak of a young beccaccia\\n The campanile, the Duomo's fit ally,\\n Shall soar up in gold full fifty braccia,\\n Completing Florence, as Florence Italy.\\n\\n\\nBut I suppose that the monologues \\\"Andrea del Sarto\\\" and \\\"Fra Lippo\\nLippi\\\" would be considered the finest fruit of Browning's Florentine\\nsojourn, as \\\"Casa Guidi Windows\\\" is of Mrs. Browning's. Her great poem\\nis indeed as passionate a plea for Italian liberty as anything by an\\nItalian poet. Here also she wrote much if not all of \\\"Aurora Leigh,\\\"\\n\\\"The Poems before Congress,\\\" and those other Italian political pieces\\nwhich when her husband collected them as \\\"Last Poems\\\" he dedicated\\n\\\"to 'grateful Florence'\\\".\\n\\nIn these Casa Guidi rooms the happiest days of both lives were\\nspent, and many a time have the walls resounded to the great voice,\\nlaughing, praising or condemning, of Walter Savage Landor; while the\\nshy Hawthorne has talked here too. Casa Guidi lodged not only the\\nBrownings, but, at one time, Lowell, who was not, however, a very\\ngood Florentine. \\\"As for pictures,\\\" I find him writing, in 1874,\\non a later visit, \\\"I am tired to death of 'em,... and then most of\\nthem are so bad. I like best the earlier ones, that say so much in\\ntheir half-unconscious prattle, and talk nature to me instead of\\nhigh art.\\\" But \\\"the older streets,\\\" he says, \\\"have a noble mediaeval\\ndistance and reserve for me -- a frown I was going to call it, not\\nof hostility, but of haughty doubt. These grim palace fronts meet\\nyou with an aristocratic start that puts you to the proof of your\\ncredentials. There is to me something wholesome in that that makes\\nyou feel your place.\\\"\\n\\nThe Brownings are the two English poets who first spring to mind\\nin connexion with Florence; but they had had very illustrious\\npredecessors. In August and September, 1638, during the reign\\nof Ferdinand II, John Milton was here, and again in the spring of\\n1639. He read Latin poems to fellow-scholars in the city and received\\ncomplimentary sonnets in reply. Here he met Galileo, and from here\\nhe made the excursion to Vallombrosa which gave him some of his most\\nfamous lines. He also learned enough of the language to write love\\npoetry to a lady in Bologna, although he is said to have offended\\nItalians generally by his strict morality.\\n\\nSkipping a hundred and eighty years we find Shelley in Florence,\\nin 1819, and it was here that his son was born, receiving the names\\nPercy Florence. Here he wrote, as I have said, his \\\"Ode to the West\\nWind\\\" and that grimly comic work \\\"Peter Bell the Third\\\".\\n\\nBut next the Brownings it is Walter Savage Landor of whom I always\\nthink as the greatest English Florentine. Florence became his second\\nhome when he was middle-aged and strong; and then again, when he was\\na very old man, shipwrecked by his impulsive and impossible temper,\\nit became his last haven. It was Browning who found him his final\\nresting-place -- a floor of rooms not far from where we now stand,\\nin the Via Nunziatina.\\n\\nFlorence is so intimately associated with Landor, and Landor was\\nso happy in Florence, that a brief outline of his life seems to\\nbe imperative. Born in 1775, the heir to considerable estates,\\nthe boy soon developed that whirlwind headstrong impatience which\\nwas to make him as notorious as his exquisite genius has made him\\nfamous. He was sent to Rugby, but disapproving of the headmaster's\\njudgment of his Latin verses, he produced such a lampoon upon him,\\nalso in Latin, as made removal or expulsion a necessity. At Oxford\\nhis Latin and Greek verses were still his delight, but he took\\nalso to politics, was called a mad Jacobin, and, in order to prove\\nhis sanity and show his disapproval of a person obnoxious to him,\\nfired a gun at his shutters and was sent down for a year. He never\\nreturned. After a period of strained relations with his father\\nand hot repudiations of all the plans for his future which were\\nmade for him -- such as entering the militia, reading law, and so\\nforth -- he retired to Wales on a small allowance and wrote \\\"Gebir\\\"\\nwhich came out in 1798, when its author was twenty-three. In 1808\\nLandor threw in his lot with the Spaniards against the French, saw\\nsome fighting and opened his purse for the victims of the war; but\\nthe usual personal quarrel intervened. Returning to England he bought\\nLlanthony Abbey, stocked it with Spanish sheep, planted extensively,\\nand was to be the squire of squires; and at the same time seeing a\\npretty penniless girl at a ball in Bath, he made a bet he would marry\\nher, and won it. As a squire he became quickly involved with neighbours\\n(an inevitable proceeding with him) and also with a Bishop concerning\\nthe restoration of the church. Lawsuits followed, and such expenses\\nand vexations occurred that Landor decided to leave England -- always\\na popular resource with his kind. His mother took over the estate\\nand allowed him an income upon which he travelled from place to\\nplace for a few years, quarrelling with his wife and making it up,\\nwriting Latin verses everywhere and on everything, and coming into\\ncollision not only with individuals but with municipalities.\\n\\nHe settled in Florence in 1821, finding rooms in the Palazzo Medici,\\nor, rather, Riccardi. There he remained for five years, which no doubt\\nwould have been a longer period had he not accused his landlord,\\nthe Marquis, who was then the head of the family, of seducing away\\nhis coachman. Landor wrote stating the charge; the Marquis, calling\\nin reply, entered the room with his hat on, and Landor first knocked\\nit off and then gave notice. It was at the Palazzo Medici that Landor\\nwas visited by Hazlitt in 1825, and here also he began the \\\"Imaginary\\nConversations,\\\" his best-known work, although it is of course such\\nbrief and faultless lyrics as \\\"Rose Aylmer\\\" and \\\"To Ianthe\\\" that have\\ngiven him his widest public.\\n\\nOn leaving the Palazzo, Landor acquired the Villa Gherardesca, on\\nthe hill-side below Fiesole, and a very beautiful little estate in\\nwhich the stream Affrico rises.\\n\\nCrabb Robinson, the friend of so many men of genius, who was in\\nFlorence in 1880, in rooms at 1341 Via della Nuova Vigna, met Landor\\nfrequently at his villa and has left his impressions. Landor had\\nmade up his mind to live and die in Italy, but hated the Italians. He\\nwould rather, he said, follow his daughter to the grave than to her\\nwedding with an Italian husband. Talking on art, he said he preferred\\nJohn of Bologna to Michelangelo, a statement he repeated to Emerson,\\nbut afterwards, I believe, recanted. He said also to Robinson that\\nhe would not give 1000 Pounds for Raphael's \\\"Transfiguration,\\\" but\\nten times that sum for Fra Bartolommeo's picture of S. Mark in the\\nPitti. Next to Raphael and Fra Bartolommeo he loved Perugino.\\n\\nLandor soon became quite the husbandman. Writing to his sisters in\\n1831, he says: \\\"I have planted 200 cypresses, 600 vines, 400 roses,\\n200 arbutuses, and 70 bays, besides laurustinas, etc., etc., and\\n60 fruit trees of the best qualities from France. I have not had\\na moment's illness since I resided here, nor have the children. My\\nwife runs after colds; it would be strange if she did not take them;\\nbut she has taken none here; hers are all from Florence. I have the\\nbest water, the best air, and the best oil in the world. They speak\\nhighly of the wine too; but here I doubt. In fact, I hate wine,\\nunless hock or claret....\\n\\n\\\"Italy is a fine climate, but Swansea better. That however is the\\nonly spot in Great Britain where we have warmth without wet. Still,\\nItaly is the country I would live in.... In two [years] I hope to\\nhave a hundred good peaches every day at table during two months:\\nat present I have had as many bad ones. My land is said to produce\\nthe best figs in Tuscany; I have usually six or seven bushels of them.\\\"\\n\\nI have walked through Lander's little paradise -- now called the Villa\\nLandor and reached by the narrow rugged road to the right just below\\nthe village of S. Domenico. Its cypresses, planted, as I imagine,\\nby Lander's own hand, are stately as minarets and its lawn is as\\ngreen and soft as that of an Oxford college. The orchard, in April,\\nwas a mass of blossom. Thrushes sang in the evergreens and the first\\nswallow of the year darted through the cypresses just as we reached\\nthe gates. It is truly a poet's house and garden.\\n\\nIn 1833 a French neighbour accused Landor of robbing him of water by\\nstopping an underground stream, and Landor naturally challenged him to\\na duel. The meeting was avoided through the tact of Lander's second,\\nthe English consul at Florence, and the two men became friends. At his\\nvilla Landor wrote much of his best prose -- the \\\"Pentameron,\\\" \\\"Pericles\\nand Aspasia\\\" and the \\\"Trial of Shakespeare for Deer-stealing \\\" -- and he\\nwas in the main happy, having so much planting and harvesting to do,\\nhis children to play with, and now and then a visitor. In the main\\ntoo he managed very well with the country people, but one day was\\namused to overhear a conversation over the hedge between two passing\\ncontadini. \\\"All the English are mad,\\\" said one, \\\"but as for this\\none...!\\\" There was a story of Landor current in Florence in those\\ndays which depicted him, furious with a spoiled dish, throwing his\\ncook out of the window, and then, realizing where he would fall,\\nexclaiming in an agony, \\\"Good God, I forgot the violets!\\\"\\n\\nSuch was Landor's impossible way on occasion that he succeeded in\\ngetting himself exiled from Tuscany; but the Grand Duke was called in\\nas pacificator, and, though the order of expulsion was not rescinded,\\nit was not carried out.\\n\\nIn 1835 Landor wrote some verses to his friend Ablett, who had lent\\nhim the money to buy the villa, professing himself wholly happy -- \\n\\n\\n Thou knowest how, and why, are dear to me\\n My citron groves of Fiesole,\\n My chirping Affrico, my beechwood nook,\\n My Naiads, with feet only in the brook,\\n Which runs away and giggles in their faces;\\n Yet there they sit, nor sigh for other places -- \\n\\n\\nbut later in the year came a serious break. Landor's relations with\\nMrs. Landor, never of such a nature as to give any sense of security,\\nhad grown steadily worse as he became more explosive, and they now\\nreached such a point that he flung out of the house one day and did\\nnot return for many years, completing the action by a poem in which\\nhe took a final (as he thought) farewell of Italy: -- \\n\\n\\n I leave thee, beauteous Italy! No more\\n From the high terraces, at even-tide,\\n To look supine into thy depths of sky,\\n The golden moon between the cliff and me,\\n Or thy dark spires of fretted cypresses\\n Bordering the channel of the milky way.\\n Fiesole and Valdarno must be dreams,\\n Hereafter, and my own lost Affrico\\n Murmur to me but the poet's song.\\n\\n\\nLandor gave his son Arnold the villa, settling a sum on his wife\\nfor the other children's maintenance, and himself returned to Bath,\\nwhere he added to his friends Sir William Napier (who first found\\na resemblance to a lion in Landor's features), John Forster, who\\nafterwards wrote his life, and Charles Dickens, who named a child\\nafter him and touched off his merrier turbulent side most charmingly\\nas Leonard Boythom in \\\"Bleak House\\\". But his most constant companion\\nwas a Pomeranian dog; in dogs indeed he found comfort all his life,\\nright to the end.\\n\\nLandor's love of his villa and estate finds expression again and again\\nin his verse written at this time. The most charming of all these\\ncharming poems -- the perfection of the light verse of a serious poet -- is\\nthe letter from England to his youngest boy, speculating on his\\nItalian pursuits. I begin at the passage describing the villa's cat: -- \\n\\n\\n Does Cincirillo follow thee about,\\n Inverting one swart foot suspensively,\\n And wagging his dread jaw at every chirp\\n Of bird above him on the olive-branch?\\n Frighten him then away! 'twas he who slew\\n Our pigeons, our white pigeons peacock-tailed,\\n That feared not you and me -- alas, nor him!\\n I flattened his striped sides along my knee,\\n And reasoned with him on his bloody mind,\\n Till he looked blandly, and half-closed his eyes\\n To ponder on my lecture in the shade.\\n I doubt his memory much, his heart a little,\\n And in some minor matters (may I say it?)\\n Could wish him rather sager. But from thee\\n God hold back wisdom yet for many years!\\n Whether in early season or in late\\n It always comes high-priced. For thy pure breast\\n I have no lesson; it for me has many.\\n Come throw it open then! What sports, what cares\\n (Since there are none too young for these) engage\\n Thy busy thoughts? Are you again at work,\\n Walter and you, with those sly labourers,\\n Geppo, Giovanni, Cecco, and Poeta,\\n To build more solidly your broken dam\\n Among the poplars, whence the nightingale\\n Inquisitively watch'd you all day long?\\n I was not of your council in the scheme,\\n Or might have saved you silver without end,\\n And sighs too without number. Art thou gone\\n Below the mulberry, where that cold pool\\n Urged to devise a warmer, and more fit\\n For mighty swimmers, swimming three abreast?\\n Or art though panting in this summer noon\\n Upon the lowest step before the hall,\\n Drawing a slice of watermelon, long\\n As Cupid's bow, athwart thy wetted lips\\n (Like one who plays Pan's pipe), and letting drop\\n The sable seeds from all their separate cells,\\n And leaving bays profound and rocks abrupt,\\n Redder than coral round Calypso's cave?\\n\\n\\nIn 1853 Landor put forth what he thought his last book, under the title\\n\\\"Last Fruit off an Old Tree\\\". Unhappily it was not his last, for in\\n1858 he issued yet one more, \\\"Dry Sticks faggotted by W. S. Landor,\\\"\\nin which was a malicious copy of verses reflecting upon a lady. He\\nwas sued for libel, lost the case with heavy damages, and once\\nmore and for the last time left England for Florence. He was now\\neighty-three. At first he went to the Villa Gherardesco, then the\\nhome of his son Arnold, but his outbursts were unbearable, and three\\ntimes he broke away, to be three times brought back. In July, 1859,\\nhe made a fourth escape, and then escaped altogether, for Browning\\ntook the matter in hand and established him, after a period in Siena,\\nin lodgings in the Via Nunziatina. From this time till his death in\\n1864 Landor may be said at last to have been at rest. He had found\\nsafe anchorage and never left it. Many friends came to see him, chief\\namong them Browning, who was at once his adviser, his admirer and his\\nshrewd observer. Landor, always devoted to pictures, but without much\\njudgment, now added to his collection; Browning in one of his letters\\nto Forster tells how he has found him \\\"particularly delighted by the\\nacquisition of three execrable daubs by Domenichino and Gaspar Poussin\\nmost benevolently battered by time\\\". Another friend says that he had\\na habit of attributing all his doubtful pictures to Corregoio. \\\"He\\ncannot,\\\" Browning continues, \\\"in the least understand that he is at\\nall wrong, or injudicious, or unfortunate in anything.... Whatever\\nhe may profess, the thing he really loves is a pretty girl to talk\\nnonsense with.\\\"\\n\\nOf the old man in the company of fair listeners we have glimpses\\nin the reminiscences of Mrs. Fields in the \\\"Atlantic Monthly\\\" in\\n1866. She also describes him as in a cloud of pictures. There with\\nhis Pomeranian Giallo within fondling distance, the poet, seated in\\nhis arm-chair, fired comments upon everything. Giallo's opinion was\\nasked on all subjects, and Landor said of him that an approving wag\\nof his tail was worth all the praise of all the \\\"Quarterlies \\\". It\\nwas Giallo who led to the profound couplet -- \\n\\n\\n He is foolish who supposes\\n Dogs are ill that have hot noses.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Fields tells how, after some classical or fashionable music had\\nbeen played, Landor would come closer to the piano and ask for an\\nold English ballad, and when \\\"Auld Robin Gray,\\\" his favourite of all,\\nwas sung, the tears would stream down his face. \\\"Ah, you don't know\\nwhat thoughts you are recalling to the troublesome old man.\\\"\\n\\nBut we have Browning's word that he did not spend much time in remorse\\nor regret, while there was the composition of the pretty little tender\\nepigrams of this last period to amuse him and Italian politics to\\nenchain his sympathy. His impulsive generosity led him to give his old\\nand trusted watch to the funds for Garibaldi's Sicilian expedition;\\nbut Browning persuaded him to take it again. For Garibaldi's wounded\\nprisoners he wrote an Italian dialogue between Savonarola and the\\nPrior of S. Marco. The death of Mrs. Browning in 1861 sent Browning\\nback to England, and Landor after that was less cheerful and rarely\\nleft the house. His chief solace was the novels of Anthony Trollope\\nand G.P.R. James. In his last year he received a visit from a young\\nEnglish poet and enthusiast for poetry, one Algernon Charles Swinburne,\\nwho arrived in time to have a little glowing talk with the old lion and\\nthus obtain inspiration for some fine memorial stanzas. On September\\n17th, 1864, Death found Landor ready -- as nine years earlier he had\\npromised it should -- \\n\\n\\nTo my ninth decade I have totter'd on,\\n And no soft arm bends now my steps to steady;\\nShe who once led me where she would, is gone,\\n So when he calls me, Death shall find me ready.\\n\\n\\nLandor was buried, as we saw, in the English cemetery within the city,\\nwhither his son Arnold was borne less than seven years later. Here is\\nhis own epitaph, one of the most perfect things in form and substance\\nin the English language: -- \\n\\n\\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife,\\n Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\\nI warmed both hands before the fire of life,\\n It sinks, and I am ready to depart.\\n\\n\\nIt should be cut on his tombstone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nThe Carmine and San Miniato\\n\\nThe human form divine and waxen -- Galileo -- Bianca Capella -- A\\nfaithful Grand Duke -- S.

Many visitors to\\nFlorence never even hear of it and one quickly finds that its chief\\nfrequenters are the poor. All the better for that. Here not only is\\nthe whole animal kingdom spread out before the eye in crowded cases,\\nbut the most wonderful collection of wax reproductions of the human\\nform is to be seen. These anatomical models are so numerous and so\\nexact that, since the human body does not change with the times,\\na medical student could learn everything from them in the most\\ngentlemanly way possible. But they need a strong stomach. Mine,\\nI confess, quailed before the end.\\n\\nThe hero of the Museum is Galileo, whose tomb at S. Croce we have seen:\\nhere are preserved certain of his instruments in a modern, floridly\\ndecorated Tribuna named after him. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) belongs\\nrather to Pisa, where he was born and where he found the Leaning Tower\\nuseful for experiments, and to Rome, where in 1611 he demonstrated\\nhis discovery of the telescope; but Florence is proud of him and it\\nwas here that he died, under circumstances tragic for an astronomer,\\nfor he had become totally blind.\\n\\nThe frescoes in the Tribuna celebrate other Italian scientific\\ntriumphs, and in the cases are historic telescopes, astrolabes,\\nbinoculars, and other mysteries.\\n\\nThe Via Maggio, which runs from Casa Guidi to the Ponte Trinita, and\\nat noon is always full of school-girls, brings us by way of the Via\\nMichelozzo to S. Spirito, but by continuing in it we pass a house of\\ngreat interest, now No. 26, where once lived the famous Bianca Capella,\\nthat beautiful and magnetic Venetian whom some hold to have been so\\nvile and others so much the victim of fate. Bianca Capella was born in\\n1543, when Francis I, Cosimo I's eldest son, afterwards to play such a\\npart in her life, was two years of age. While he was being brought up\\nin Florence, Bianca was gaining loveliness in her father's palace. When\\nshe was seventeen she fell in love with a young Florentine engaged\\nin a bank in Venice, and they were secretly married. Her family\\nwere outraged by the m\\u00e9salliance and the young couple had to flee\\nto Florence, where they lived in poverty and hiding, a prize of 2000\\nducats being offered by the Capella family to anyone who would kill\\nthe husband; while, by way of showing how much in earnest they were,\\nthey had his uncle thrown into prison, where he died.\\n\\nOne day the unhappy Bianca was sitting at her window when the young\\nprince Francis was passing: he looked up, saw her, and was enslaved on\\nthe spot. (The portraits of Bianca do not, I must admit, lay emphasis\\non this story. Titian's I have not seen; but there is one by Bronzino\\nin our National Gallery -- No. 650 -- and many in Florence.) There was,\\nhowever, something in Bianca's face to which Francis fell a victim, and\\nhe brought about a speedy meeting. At first Bianca repulsed him; but\\nwhen she found that her husband was unworthy of her, she returned the\\nPrince's affection. (I am telling her story from the pro-Bianca point\\nof view: there are plenty of narrators on the other side.) Meanwhile,\\nFrancis's official life going on, he married that archduchess Joanna\\nof Austria for whom the Austrian frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio were\\npainted; but his heart remained Bianca's and he was more at her house\\nthan in his own. At last, Bianca's husband being killed in some fray,\\nshe was free from the persecution of her family and ready to occupy\\nthe palace which Francis hastened to build for her, here, in the Via\\nMaggio, now cut up into tenements at a few lire a week. The attachment\\ncontinued unabated when Francis came to the throne, and upon the death\\nof his archduchess in 1578 Bianca and he were almost immediately,\\nbut privately, married, she being then thirty-five; and in the next\\nyear they were publicly married in the church of S. Lorenzo with every\\ncircumstance of pomp; while later in the same year Bianca was crowned.\\n\\nFrancis remained her lover till his death, which was both dramatic\\nand suspicious, husband and wife dying within a few hours of each\\nother at the Medici villa of Poggia a Caiano in 1587. Historians\\nhave not hesitated to suggest that Francis was poisoned by his wife;\\nbut there is no proof. It is indeed quite possible that her life\\nwas more free of intrigue, ambition and falsehood, than that of any\\none about the court at that time; but the Florentines, encouraged by\\nFrancis's brother Ferdinand I, who succeeded him, made up their minds\\nthat she was a witch, and few things in the way of disaster happened\\nthat were not laid to her charge. Call a woman a witch and everything\\nis possible. Ferdinand not only detested Bianca in life and deplored\\nher fascination for his brother, but when she died he refused to allow\\nher to be buried with the others of the family; hence the Chapel of\\nthe Princes at S. Lorenzo lacks one archduchess. Her grave is unknown.\\n\\nThe whole truth we shall never know; but it is as easy to think of\\nBianca as a harmless woman who both lost and gained through love as\\nto picture her as sinister and scheming. At any rate we know that\\nFrancis was devoted to her with a fidelity and persistence for which\\nGrand Dukes have not always been conspicuous.\\n\\nS. Spirito is one of Brunelleschi's solidest works. Within it resembles\\nthe city of Bologna in its vistas of brown and white arches. The\\neffect is severe and splendid; but the church is to be taken rather\\nas architecture than a treasury of art, for although each of its\\neight and thirty chapels has an altar picture and several have fine\\npieces of sculpture -- one a copy of Michelangelo's famous Pieta in\\nRome -- there is nothing of the highest value. It was in this church\\nthat I was asked alms by one of the best-dressed men in Florence;\\nbut the Florentine beggars are not importunate: they ask, receive or\\nare denied, and that is the end of it.\\n\\nThe other great church in the Pitti quarter is the Carmine, and here\\nwe are on very sacred ground in art -- for it was here, as I have had\\noccasion to say more than once in this book, that Masaccio painted\\nthose early frescoes which by their innovating boldness turned the\\nBrancacci chapel into an Academy. For all the artists came to study\\nand copy them: among others Michelangelo, whose nose was broken by\\nthe turbulent Torrigiano, a fellow-student, under this very roof.\\n\\nTommaso di Ser Giovanni, or Masaccio, the son of a notary, was born\\nin 1402. His master is not known, but Tommaso Fini or Masolino,\\nborn in 1383, is often named. Vasari states that as a youth Masaccio\\nhelped Ghiberti with his first Baptistery doors; and if so, the fact\\nis significant. But all that is really known of his early life is\\nthat he went to Rome to paint a chapel in S. Clemente. He returned,\\napparently on hearing that his patron Giovanni de' Medici was in\\npower again. Another friend, Brunelleschi, having built the church\\nof S. Spirito in 1422, Masaccio began to work there in 1423, when he\\nwas only twenty-one.\\n\\nMasaccio's peculiar value in the history of painting is his early\\ncombined power of applying the laws of perspective and representing\\nhuman beings \\\"in the round\\\". Giotto was the first and greatest\\ninnovator in painting -- the father of real painting; Masaccio was the\\nsecond. If from Giotto's influence a stream of vigour had flowed such\\nas flowed from Masaccio's, there would have been nothing special to\\nnote about Masaccio at all. But the impulse which Giotto gave to art\\ndied down; some one had to reinvigorate it, and that some one was\\nMasaccio. In his remarks on painting, Leonardo da Vinci sums up the\\nachievements of the two. They stood out, he says, from the others\\nof their time, by reason of their wish to go to life rather than to\\npictures. Giotto went to life, his followers went to pictures; and\\nthe result was a decline in art until Masaccio, who again went to life.\\n\\nFrom the Carmine frescoes came the new painting. It is not that walls\\nhenceforth were covered more beautifully or suitably than they had\\nbeen by Giotto's followers; probably less suitably very often; but\\nthat religious symbolism without much relation to actual life gave\\nway to scenes which might credibly have occurred, where men, women\\nand saints walked and talked much as we do, in similar surroundings,\\nwith backgrounds of cities that could be lived in and windows that\\ncould open. It was this revolution that Masaccio performed. No doubt\\nif he had not, another would, for it had to come: the new demand was\\nthat religion should be reconciled with life.\\n\\nIt is generally supposed that Masaccio had Masolino as his ally in\\nthis wonderful series; and a vast amount of ink has been spilt over\\nMasolino's contributions. Indeed the literature of expert art criticism\\non Florentine pictures alone is of alarming bulk and astonishing in\\nits affirmations and denials. The untutored visitor in the presence\\nof so much scientific variance will be wise to enact the part of\\nthe lawyer in the old caricature of the litigants and the cow, who,\\nwhile they pull, one at the head and the other at the tail, fills\\nhis bucket with milk. In other words, the plain duty of the ordinary\\nperson is to enjoy the picture.\\n\\nWithout any special knowledge of art one can, by remembering the\\nearly date of these frescoes, realize what excitement they must have\\ncaused in the studios and how tongues must have clacked in the Old\\nMarket. We have but to send our thoughts to the Spanish chapel at\\nS. Maria Novella to realize the technical advance. Masaccio, we see,\\nwas peopling a visible world; the Spanish chapel painters were merely\\nallegorizing, as agents of holiness. The Ghirlandaio choir in the same\\nchurch would yield a similar comparison; but what we have to remember\\nis that Ghirlandaio painted these frescoes in 1490, sixty-two years\\nafter Masaccio's death, and Masaccio showed him how.\\n\\nIt is a pity that the light is so poor and that the frescoes have\\nnot worn better; but their force and dramatic vigour remain beyond\\ndoubt. The upper scene on the left of the altar is very powerful: the\\nRoman tax collector has asked Christ for a tribute and Christ bids\\nPeter find the money in the mouth of a fish. Figures, architecture,\\nlandscape, all are in right relation; and the drama is moving, without\\nrestlessness. This and the S. Peter preaching and distributing alms\\nare perhaps the best, but the most popular undoubtedly is that below\\nit, finished many years after by Filippino Lippi (although there are\\nexperts to question this and even substitute his amorous father), in\\nwhich S. Peter, challenged by Simon Magus, resuscitates a dead boy,\\njust as S. Zenobius used to do in the streets of this city. Certain\\nmore modern touches, such as the exquisite Filippino would naturally\\nhave thought of, may be seen here: the little girl behind the boy,\\nfor instance, who recalls the children in that fresco by the same\\nhand at S. Maria Novella in which S. John resuscitates Drusiana. In\\nthis Carmine fresco are many portraits of Filippino's contemporaries,\\nincluding Botticelli, just as in the scene of the consecration of\\nthe Carmine which Masaccio painted in the cloisters, but which has\\nalmost perished, he introduced Brancacci, his employer, Brunelleschi,\\nDonatello, some of whose innovating work in stone he was doing in\\npaint, Giovanni de' Medici and Masolino. The scanty remains of this\\nfresco tell us that it must have been fine indeed.\\n\\nMasaccio died at the early age of twenty-six, having suddenly\\ndisappeared from Florence, leaving certain work unfinished. A strange\\nportentous meteor in art.\\n\\nThe Pitti side of the river is less interesting than the other,\\nbut it has some very fascinating old and narrow streets, although\\nthey are less comfortable for foreigners to wander in than those,\\nfor example, about the Borgo SS. Apostoli. They are far dirtier.\\n\\nFrom the Pitti end of the Ponte Vecchio one can obtain a most charming\\nwalk. Turn to the left as you leave the bridge, under the arch made by\\nCosimo's passage, and you are in the Via de' Bardi, the backs of whose\\nhouses on the river-side are so beautiful from the Uffizi's central\\narches, as Mr. Morley's picture shows. At the end of the street is\\nan archway under a large house. Go through this, and you are at the\\nfoot of a steep, stone hill. It is really steep, but never mind. Take\\nit easily, and rest half-way where the houses on the left break and\\ngive a wonderful view of the city. Still climbing, you come to the\\nbest gate of all that is left -- a true gate in being an inlet into a\\nfortified city -- that of S. Giorgio, high on the Boboli hill by the\\nfort. The S. Giorgio gate has a S. George killing a dragon, in stone,\\non its outside, and the saint painted within, Donatello's conception\\nof him being followed by the artist. Parsing through, you are in the\\ncountry. The fort and gardens are on one side and villas on the other;\\nand a great hill-side is in front, covered with crops. Do not go on,\\nbut turn sharp to the left and follow the splendid city wall, behind\\nwhich for a long way is the garden of the Villa Karolath, one of the\\nchoicest spots in Florence, occasionally tossing its branches over the\\ntop. This wall is immense all the way down to the Porta S. Miniato,\\nand two of the old towers are still standing in their places upon\\nit. Botticini's National Gallery picture tells exactly how they looked\\nin their heyday. Ivy hangs over, grass and flowers spring from the\\nancient stones, and lizards run about. Underneath are olive-trees.\\n\\nIt was, by the way, in the Via de' Bardi that George Eliot's\\nRomola lived, for she was of the Bardi family. The story, it may be\\nremembered, begins on the morning of Lorenzo the Magnificent's death,\\nand ends after the execution of Savonarola. It is not an inspired\\nromance, and is remarkable almost equally for its psychological\\nomissions and the convenience of its coincidences, but it is an\\nexcellent preparation for a first visit in youth to S. Marco and the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, while the presence in its somewhat naive pages of\\ncertain Florentine characters makes it agreeable to those who know\\nsomething of the city and its history. The painter Piero di Cosimo,\\nfor example, is here, straight from Vasari; so also are Cronaca, the\\narchitect, Savonarola, Capparo, the ironsmith, and even Machiavelli;\\nwhile Bernardo del Nero, the gonfalonier, whose death sentence\\nSavonarola refused to revise, was Romola's godfather.\\n\\nThe Via Guicciardini, which runs from the foot of the Via de' Bardi\\nto the Pitti, is one of the narrowest and busiest Florentine streets,\\nwith an undue proportion of fruit shops overflowing to the pavement\\nto give it gay colouring. At No. 24 is a stable with pillars and\\narches that would hold up a pyramid. But this is no better than most\\nof the old stables of Florence, which are all solid vaulted caverns\\nof immense size and strength.\\n\\nFrom the Porta Romana one may do many things -- take the tram,\\nfor example, for the Certosa of the Val d'Ema, which is only some\\ntwenty minutes distant, or make a longer journey to Impruneta, where\\nthe della Robbias are. But just now let us walk or ride up the long\\nwinding Viale Macchiavelli, which curves among the villas behind the\\nBoboli Gardens, to the Piazzale Michelangelo and S. Miniato.\\n\\nThe Piazzale Michelangelo is one of the few modern tributes of Florence\\nto her illustrious makers. The Dante memorial opposite S. Croce is\\nanother, together with the preservation of certain buildings with\\nDante associations in the heart of the city; but, as I have said more\\nthan once, there is no piazza in Florence, and only one new street,\\nnamed after a Medici. From the Piazzale Michelangelo you not only\\nhave a fine panoramic view of the city of this great man -- in its\\nprincipal features not so vastly different from the Florence of his\\nday, although of course larger and with certain modern additions,\\nsuch as factory chimneys, railway lines, and so forth -- but you can see\\nthe remains of the fortifications which he constructed in 1529, and\\nwhich kept the Imperial troops at bay for nearly a year. Just across\\nthe river rises S. Croce, where the great man is buried, and beyond,\\nover the red roofs, the dome of the Medici chapel at S. Lorenzo shows\\nus the position of the Biblioteca Laurenziana and the New Sacristy,\\nboth built by him. Immediately below us is the church of S. Niccolo,\\nwhere he is said to have hidden in 1529, when there was a hue and\\ncry for him. In the middle of this spacious plateau is a bronze\\nreproduction of his David, and it is good to see it, from the cafe\\nbehind it, rising head and shoulders above the highest Apennines.\\n\\nS. Miniato, the church on the hill-top above the Piazzale Michelangelo,\\ndeserves many visits. One may not be too greatly attached to marble\\nfa\\u00e7ades, but this little temple defeats all prejudices by its radiance\\nand perfection, and to its extraordinary charm its situation adds. It\\ncrowns the hill, and in the late afternoon -- the ideal time to visit\\nit -- is full in the eye of the sun, bathed in whose light the green\\nand white fa\\u00e7ade, with miracles of delicate intarsia, is balm to the\\neyes instead of being, as marble so often is, dazzling and cold.\\n\\nOn the way up we pass the fine church of S. Salvatore, which Cronaca\\nof the Palazzo Vecchio and Palazzo Strozzi built and Michelangelo\\nadmired, and which is now secularized, and pass through the gateway of\\nMichelangelo's upper fortifications. S. Miniato is one of the oldest\\nchurches of Florence, some of it eleventh century. It has its name\\nfrom Minias, a Roman soldier who suffered martyrdom at Florence under\\nDecius. Within, one does not feel quite to be in a Christian church,\\nthe effect partly of the unusual colouring, all grey, green, and gold\\nand soft light tints as of birds' bosoms; partly of the ceiling,\\nwhich has the bright hues of a Russian toy; partly of the forest\\nof great gay columns; partly of the lovely and so richly decorated\\nmarble screen; and partly of the absence of a transept. The prevailing\\nfeeling indeed is gentle gaiety; and in the crypt this is intensified,\\nfor it is just a joyful assemblage of dancing arches.\\n\\nThe church as a whole is beautiful and memorable enough; but\\nits details are wonderful too, from the niello pavement, and\\nthe translucent marble windows of the apse, to the famous tomb of\\nCardinal Jacopo of Portugal, and the Luca della Robbia reliefs of the\\nVirtues. This tomb is by Antonio Rossellino. It is not quite of the\\nrank of Mino's in the Badia; but it is a noble and beautiful thing\\nmarked in every inch of it by modest and exquisite thought. Vasari\\nsays of Antonio that he \\\"practised his art with such grace that\\nhe was valued as something more than a man by those who knew him,\\nwho well-nigh adored him as a saint\\\". Facing it is a delightful\\nAnnunciation by Alessio Baldovinetti, in which the angel declares the\\nnews from a far greater distance than we are accustomed to; and the\\nceiling is made an abode of gladness by the blue and white figures\\n(designed by Luca della Robbia) of Prudence and Chastity, Moderation\\nand Fortitude, for all of which qualities, it seems, the Cardinal was\\nfamous. In short, one cannot be too glad that, since he had to die,\\ndeath's dart struck down this Portuguese prelate while he was in\\nRossellino's and Luca's city.\\n\\nNo longer is preserved here the miraculous crucifix which, standing\\nin a little chapel in the wood on this spot, bestowed blessing and\\npardon -- by bending towards him -- upon S. Giovanni Gualberto, the founder\\nof the Vallombrosan order. The crucifix is now in S. Trinita. The saint\\nwas born in 985 of noble stock and assumed naturally the splendour and\\narrogance of his kind. His brother Hugo being murdered in some affray,\\nGiovanni took upon himself the duty of avenging the crime. One Good\\nFriday he chanced to meet, near this place, the assassin, in so narrow\\na passage as to preclude any chance of escape; and he was about to kill\\nhim when the man fell on his knees and implored mercy by the passion of\\nChrist Who suffered on that very day, adding that Christ had prayed on\\nthe cross for His own murderers. Giovanni was so much impressed that he\\nnot only forgave the man but offered him his friendship. Entering then\\nthe chapel to pray and ask forgiveness of all his sins, he was amazed\\nto see the crucifix bend down as though acquiescing and blessing, and\\nthis special mark of favour so wrought upon him that he became a monk,\\nhimself shaving his head for that purpose and defying his father's\\nrage, and subsequently founded the Vallombrosan order. He died in 1073.\\n\\nI have said something of the S. Croce habit and the S. Maria Novella\\nhabit; but I think that when all is said the S. Miniato habit is\\nthe most important to acquire. There is nothing else like it; and\\nthe sense of height is so invigorating too. At all times of the year\\nit is beautiful; but perhaps best in early spring, when the highest\\nmountains still have snow upon them and the neighbouring slopes are\\ncovered with tender green and white fruit blossom, and here the violet\\nwistaria blooms and there the sombre crimson of the Judas-tree.\\n\\nBehind and beside the church is a crowded city of the Florentine\\ndead, reproducing to some extent the city of the Florentine living,\\nin its closely packed habitations -- the detached palaces for the rich\\nand the great congeries of cells for the poor -- more of which are\\nbeing built all the time. There is a certain melancholy interest in\\nwandering through these silent streets, peering through the windows\\nand recognizing over the vaults names famous in Florence. One learns\\nquickly how bad modern mortuary architecture and sculpture can be,\\nbut I noticed one monument with some sincerity and unaffected grace:\\nthat to a charitable Marchesa, a friend of the poor, at the foot of\\nwhose pedestal are a girl and baby done simply and well.\\n\\nBetter perhaps to remain on the highest point and look at the\\ncity beneath. One should try to be there before sunset and watch\\nthe Apennines turning to a deeper and deeper indigo and the city\\ngrowing dimmer and dimmer in the dusk. Florence is beautiful from\\nevery point of vantage, but from none more beautiful than from this\\neminence. As one reluctantly leaves the church and passes again\\nthrough Michelangelo's fortification gateway to descend, one has,\\nframed in its portal, a final lovely Apennine scene.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Title: Italian Highways and Byways from a Motor Car\\nAuthor: Francis Miltoun\\nPublisher: L. C. Page & Company\\nPlace of publication: Boston\\nDate: 1909\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE WAY ABOUT ITALY\\n\\n\\nOne travels in Italy chiefly in search of the picturesque, but in\\nFlorence, Rome, Naples, Venice or Milan, and in the larger towns lying\\nbetween, there is, in spite of the romantic association of great names,\\nlittle that appeals to one in a personal sense. One admires what Ruskin,\\nHare or Symonds tells one to admire, gets a smattering of the romantic\\nhistory of the great families of the palaces and villas of Rome and\\nFlorence, but absorbs little or nothing of the genuine feudal traditions\\nof the background regions away from the well-worn roads.\\n\\nAlong the highways and byways runs the itinerary of the author and\\nillustrator of this book, and they have thus been able to view many of\\nthe beauties and charms of the countryside which have been unknown to\\nmost travellers in Italy in these days of the modern railway.\\n\\n Alla Campagna was our watchword as we set out to pass as many of our\\nItalian days and nights as possible in places little celebrated in\\npopular annals, a better way of knowing Italy than one will ever know it\\nwhen viewed simply from the Vatican steps or Frascati's gardens.\\n\\nThe palaces and villas of Rome, Florence and Venice are known to most\\nEuropean travellers -- as they know Capri, Vesuvius or Amalfi; but of the\\ngrim castles of Ancona, of Rimini and Ravenna, and of the classic charms\\nof Taormina or of Sarazza they know considerably less; and still less of\\nMonte Cristo's Island, of Elba, of Otranto, and of the little\\nhidden-away mountain towns of the Alps of Piedmont and the Val d'Aoste.\\n\\nThe automobile, as a means of getting about, has opened up many old and\\nhalf-used byways, and the automobile traveller of to-day may confidently\\nassert that he has come to know the countryside of a beloved land as it\\nwas not even possible for his grandfathers to know it.\\n\\nThe Italian tour may be made as a conducted tour, as an educative tour,\\nas a mere butterfly tour (as it often has been), or as a honeymoon\\ntrip, but the reason for its making is always the same; the fact that\\nItaly is a soft, fair, romantic land where many things have existed, and\\nstill exist, that may be found nowhere else on earth.\\n\\nThe romance of travel and the process of gathering legends and tales of\\nlocal manners and customs is in no way spoiled because of modern means\\nof travel. Many a hitherto unexploited locality, with as worthy a\\nmonumental shrine as many more celebrated, will now become accessible,\\nperhaps even well known.\\n\\nThe pilgrim goes to Italy because of his devotion to religion, or to art\\nor architecture, and, since this is the reason for his going, it is this\\nreason, too, which has caused the making of more travel books on Italy\\nthan on all other continental countries combined. There are some who\\naffect only \\\"old masters\\\" or literary shrines, others who crave palaces\\nor villas, and yet others who haunt the roulette tables of Monte Carlo,\\nBiarritz, or some exclusive Club in the \\\"Eternal City.\\\" European travel\\nis all things to all men.\\n\\nThe pilgrims that come to Italy in increasing numbers each year are not\\nall born and bred of artistic tastes, but the expedition soon brings a\\nglimmer of it to the most sordid soul that ever took his amusements\\napart from his edification, and therein lies the secret of pleasurable\\ntravel for all classes. The automobilist should bear this in mind and\\nnot eat up the roadway through \\u00c6milia at sixty miles an hour simply\\nbecause it is possible. There are things to see en route, though none of\\nyour speeding friends have ever mentioned them. Get acquainted with them\\nyourself and pass the information on to the next. That is what the\\nautomobile is doing for modern travel -- more than the stage or the\\nrailway ever did, and more than the aeroplane ever will!\\n\\nOne does not forget the American who went home to the \\\"Far West\\\" and\\nrecalled Rome as the city where he bought an alleged panama hat (made\\nprobably at Leghorn). He is no myth. One sees his like every day. He who\\nhurried his daughter away from the dim outlined aisles of Milan's Gothic\\nwonder to see the new electric light works and the model tramway station\\nwas one of these, but he was the better for having done a round of the\\ncathedrals of Italy, even if he did get a hazy idea of them mixed up\\nwith his practical observations on street-lighting and transportation.\\n\\nSuperficial Italian itineraries have been made often, and their\\nchronicles set down. They are still being made, and chronicled, but the\\nmakers of guide books have, as yet, catered but little to the class of\\nleisurely travellers, a class who would like to know where some of these\\nunexploited monuments exist; where these unfamiliar histories and\\nlegends may be heard, and how they may all be arrived at, absorbed and\\ndigested. The people of the countryside, too, are usually more\\ninteresting than those of the towns. One has only to compare the Italian\\npeasant and his picturesque life with the top-hatted and frock-coated\\nRoman of to-day to arrive quickly to a conclusion as to which is typical\\nof his surroundings. The Medicis, the Borgias, and the Colonnas have\\ngone, and to find the real romantic Italian and his manner of life one\\nhas to hunt him in the small towns.\\n\\nThe modern traveller in Italy by road will do well to recall the\\nconditions which met the traveller of past days. The mere recollection\\nof a few names and dates will enable the automobilist to classify his\\nimpressions on the road in a more definite and satisfying manner than if\\nhe took no cognizance of the pilgrims who have gone before.\\n\\nChaucer set out ostensibly for Genoa in 1373 and incidentally met\\nPetrarch at Padua and talked shop. A monk named Felix, from Ulm on the\\nbanks of the Danube, en route for Jerusalem, stopped off at Venice and\\nwrote things down about it in his diary, which he called a \\\"faithful\\ndescription.\\\" Albrecht Durer visited Venice in 1505 and made friends\\nwith many there, and from Venice went to Bologna and Ferrara. An English\\ncrusading knight in the same century \\\"took in\\\" Italy en route to the\\nHoly Land, entering the country via Chamb\\u00e9ry and Aiguebelle -- the most\\ndelightful gateway even to-day. Automobilists should work this itinerary\\nout on some diagrammatic road map. Martin Luther, \\\"with some business to\\ntransact with the Pope's Vicar,\\\" passed through Milan, Pavia, Bologna\\nand Florence on his way to Rome, and Rabelais in 1532 followed in the\\ntrain of Cardinal du Bellay, and his account of how he \\\"saw the Pope\\\" is\\ninteresting reading in these days when even personally-conducted\\ntourists look forward to the same thing. Joachim du Bellay's \\\"visions of\\nRome\\\" are good poetry, but as he was partisan to his own beloved Loire\\ngaulois , to the disparagement of the Tiber latin , their topographical\\nworth is somewhat discounted.\\n\\nSir Philip Sidney was in Padua and Venice in 1573, and he brought back a\\nportrait of himself painted in the latter city by Paul Veronese, as\\ntourists to-day carry away wine glasses with their initials embossed on\\nthem. The sentiment is the same, but taste was better in the old days.\\n\\nRubens was at Venice in 1600, and there are those who say that\\nShakespeare got his local colour \\\"on the spot.\\\" Mr. Sidney Lee says no!\\n\\nBack to the land, as Dante, Petrarch, even Horace and Virgil, have said.\\nDante the wayfarer was a mighty traveller, and so was Petrach. Horace\\nand Virgil took their viewpoints from the Roman capital, but they penned\\nfaithful pictures which in setting and colouring have, in but few\\ninstances, changed unto this day.\\n\\nDante is believed to have been in Rome when the first sentence was\\npassed upon him, and from the Eternal City one can follow his\\njourneyings northward by easy stages to Siena and Arezzo, to the Alps,\\nto Padua, on the Aemilian Way, his wandering on Roman roads, his flight\\nby sea to Marseilles, again at Verona and finally at Ravenna, the last\\nrefuge.\\n\\nThis was an Italian itinerary worth the doing. Why should we modern\\ntravellers not take some historical personage and follow his (or her)\\nfootsteps from the cradle to the grave? To follow in the footsteps of\\nJeanne d'Arc, of Dante Alighieri, or of Petrarch and his Laura -- though\\ntheir ways were widely divergent -- or of Henri IV, Fran\\u00e7ois I, or Charles\\nV, would add a zest and reason for being to an automobile tour of Europe\\nwhich no twenty-four hour record from London to Monte Carlo, or eighteen\\nhours from Naples to Geneva could possibly have.\\n\\nThere is another class of travellers who will prefer to wax solemn over\\nthe notorious journey to Italy of Alfred de Musset and Georges Sand. It\\nwas a most romantic trip, as the world knows. De Musset even had to ask\\nhis mother's consent to make it. The past mistress of eloquence appeared\\nat once on the maternal threshold and promised to look after the young\\nman -- like a mother.\\n\\nDe Musset's brother saw the pair off \\\"on a misty melancholy evening,\\\"\\nand noted amongst other dark omens, that \\\"the coach in which the\\ntravellers took their seats was the thirteenth to leave the yard,\\\" but\\nfor the life of us we cannot share his solemnity. The travellers met\\nStendhal at Lyons. After supper \\\"he was very merry, got rather drunk and\\ndanced round the table in his big topboots.\\\" In Florence they could not\\nmake up their minds whether to go to Rome or to Venice, and settled the\\nmatter by the toss of a coin. Is it possible to care much for the\\nfortunes of two such heedless cynics?\\n\\nIt is such itineraries as have here been outlined, the picking up of\\nmore or less indistinct trails and following them a while, that gives\\nthat peculiar charm to Italian travel. Not the dreamy, idling mood that\\nthe sentimentalists would have us adopt, but a burning feverishness that\\nhardly allows one to linger before any individual shrine. Rather one is\\npushed from behind and drawn from in front to an ever unreachable goal.\\nOne never finishes his Italian travels. Once the habit is formed, it\\nbecomes a disease. We care not that Cimabue is no longer considered to\\nbe throned the painter of the celebrated Madonna in Santa Maria Novella,\\nor that Andrea del Sarto and his wife are no longer Andrea del Sarto and\\nhis wife, so long as we can weave together a fabric which pleases us,\\nregardless of the new criticism, -- or the old, for that matter.\\n\\nWe used to go to the places marked on our railway tickets, and \\\"stopped\\noff\\\" only as the regulations allowed. Now we go where fancy wills and\\nstop off where the vagaries of our automobile force us to. And we get\\nmore notions of Italy into our heads in six weeks than could otherwise\\nbe acquired in six months.\\n\\nOne need not go so very far afield to get away from the conventional in\\nItaly. Even that strip of coastline running from Menton in France to\\nReggio in Calabria is replete with unknown, or at least unexploited,\\nlittle corners, which have a wealth of picturesque and romantic charm,\\nand as noble and impressive architectural monuments as one may find in\\nthe peninsula.\\n\\n Com \\u00e8 bella , say the French honeymoon couples as they enter Italy via\\nthe Milan Express over the Simplon; com \\u00e8 bella , say one and all who\\nhave trod or ridden the highways and byways up and down and across\\nItaly; com \\u00e8 bella is the p\\u00e6an of every one who has made the Italian\\nround, whether they have been frequenters of the great cities and towns,\\nor have struck out across country for themselves and found some\\ncreeper-clad ruin, or a villa in some ideally romantic situation which\\nthe makers of guide-books never heard of, or have failed to mention. All\\nthis is possible to the traveller by road in Italy, and one's only\\nunpleasant memories are of the buona mano of the brigands of hotel\\nservants which infest the large cities and towns -- about the only\\nbrigands one meets in Italy to-day.\\n\\nThe real Italy, the old Italy, still exists, though half hidden by the\\nwall of progress built up by young liberty-loving Italy since the days\\nof Garibaldi; but one has to step aside and look for the old r\\u00e9gime. It\\ncannot always be discovered from the window of a railway carriage or a\\nhotel omnibus, though it is often brought into much plainer view from\\nthe cushions of an automobile. \\\"Motor Cars and the Genus Loci\\\" was a\\nvery good title indeed for an article which recently appeared in a\\nquarterly review. The writer ingeniously discovered -- as some of the rest\\nof us have also -- the real mission of the automobile. It takes us into\\nthe heart of the life of a country instead of forcing us to travel in a\\nprison van on iron rails.\\n\\nLet the tourist in Italy \\\"do\\\" -- and \\\"do\\\" as thoroughly as he likes -- the\\ngalleries of Rome, Florence, Siena, and Venice, but let him not neglect\\nthe more appealing and far more natural uncontaminated beauties of the\\ncountryside and the smaller towns, such as Caserta, Arezzo, Lucca,\\nMontepulciana, Barberino in Mugello and Ancona, and as many others as\\nfit well into his itinerary from the Alps to \\u00c6tna or from Reggio to\\nRagusa. They lack much of the popular renown that the great centres\\npossess, but they still have an aspect of the reality of the life of\\nmedi\\u00e6valism which is difficult to trace when surrounded by all the\\nup-to-date and supposedly necessitous things which are burying Rome's\\nruins deeper than they have ever yet been buried. It is difficult indeed\\nto imagine what old Rome was like, with Frascati given over to \\\"hunt\\nparties\\\" and the hotel drawing rooms replete with Hungarian orchestras.\\nIt is difficult, indeed!\\n\\nItaly is a vast kinetoscope of heterogeneous sights and scenes and\\nmemories and traditions such as exist on no other part of the earth's\\nsurface. Of this there is no doubt, and yet each for himself may find\\nsomething new, whether it is a supposed \\\"secret of the Vatican\\\" or an\\nunheard of or forgotten romance of an Italian villa. This is the genus\\nloci of Italy, the charm of Italy, the unresistible lodestone which\\ndraws tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands thither each\\nyear, from England and America. Italy is the most romantic touring\\nground in all the world, and, though its highways and byways are not the\\nequal in surface of the \\\"good roads\\\" of France, they are, in good\\nweather , considerably better than the automobilist from overseas is\\nused to at home. At one place we found fifty kilometres of the worst\\nroad we had ever seen in Italy immediately followed by a like stretch\\nof the best. The writer does not profess to be able to explain the\\nanomaly. In general the roads in the mountains are better than those at\\nlow level, so one should plan his itineraries accordingly.\\n\\nThe towns and cities of Italy are very well known to all well-read\\npersons, but of the countryside and its manners and customs this is not\\nso true. Modern painters have limned the outlines of San Marco at Venice\\nand the Castle of St. Angelo at Rome, on countless canvases, and\\npictures of the \\\"Grand Canal\\\" and of \\\"Vesuvius in Eruption\\\" are familiar\\nenough; but paintings of the little hill towns, the wayside shrines, the\\nolive and orange groves, and vineyards, or a sketch of some quaint\\nroadside albergo made whilst the automobile was temporarily held up by a\\ntire blow out, is quite as interesting and not so common. There is many\\na pine-clad slope, convent-crowned hill-top and castled crag in Italy as\\ninteresting as the more famous, historic sites.\\n\\nTo appreciate Italy one must know it from all sides and in all its\\nmoods. The hurried itinerary which comprises getting off the ship at\\nNaples, doing the satellite resorts and \\\"sights\\\" which fringe Naples\\nBay, and so on to Rome, Florence and Venice, and thence across\\nSwitzerland, France and home is too frequently a reality. The\\nautomobilist may have a better time of it if he will but be rational;\\nbut, for the hurried flight above outlined, he should leave his\\nautomobile at home and make the trip by \\\"train de luxe.\\\" It would be\\nless costly and he would see quite as much of Italy -- perhaps more. The\\nleisurely automobile traveller who rolls gently in and out of hitherto\\nunheard of little towns and villages is in another class and learns\\nsomething of a beloved land and the life of the people that the hurried\\ntourist will never suspect.\\n\\nThe genuine vagabond traveller, even though he may be a lover of art and\\narchitecture, and knows just how bad Canova's lions really are, is quite\\nas much concerned with the question as to why Italians drink wine red\\ninstead of white, or why the sunny Sicilian will do more quarrelling and\\nless shovelling of dirt on a railroad or a canal job than his northern\\nbrother. It is interesting, too, to learn something -- by stumbling upon\\nit as we did -- about Carrara marble, Leghorn hats and macaroni, which\\nused to form the bulk of the cargoes of ships sailing from Italian ports\\nto those of the United States. The Canovas, like the Botticellis, are\\nalways there -- it is forbidden to export art treasures from Italy, so\\none can always return to confirm his suspicions -- but the marble has\\nfound its competitor elsewhere, Leghorn hats are now made in far larger\\nquantities in Philadelphia, and the macaroni sent out from Brooklyn in a\\nmonth would keep all Italy from starvation for a year.\\n\\nThe Italian picture and its framing is like no other, whether one\\ncommences with the snow-crested Alps of Piedmont and finishes with Bella\\nNapoli and its dazzling blue, or whether he finishes with the Queen of\\nthe Adriatic and begins with Capri. It is always Italy. The same is not\\ntrue of France. Provence might, at times, and in parts, be taken for\\nSpain, Algeria or Corsica; Brittany for Ireland and Lorraine for\\nGermany. On the contrary Piedmont, in Italy, is nothing at all like\\nneighbouring Dauphin\\u00e9 or Savoie, nor is Liguria like Nice.\\n\\nAs for the disadvantages of Italian travel, they do undoubtedly exist,\\nas well for the automobilist as for him who travels by rail. In the\\nfirst place, in spite of the picturesque charm of the Italian\\ncountryside, the roads are, as a whole, not by any means the equal of\\nthose of the rest of Europe -- always, of course, excepting Spain. They\\nare far better indeed in Algeria and Tunisia. Hotel expenses are double\\nwhat they are in France for the same sort of accommodation -- for the\\nautomobilist at any rate. Garage accommodation is seldom, if ever, to be\\nfound in the hotel, at least not of a satisfactory kind, and when found\\ncosts anywhere from two to three, or even five, francs a night. Gasoline\\nand oil are held at inflated figures, though no one seems to know who\\ngets all the profit that comes from the fourteen to eighteen francs\\nwhich the Italian garage keeper or grocer or druggist takes for the\\nusual five gallons.\\n\\nWith this information as a forewarning the stranger automobilist in\\nItaly will meet with no undue surprises except that bad weather, if he\\nhappens to strike a spell, will considerably affect a journey that would\\notherwise have proved enjoyable.\\n\\nThe climate of Italy is far from being uniform. It is not all orange\\ngroves and palm trees. Throughout Piedmont and Lombardy snow and frost\\nare the frequent accompaniments of winter. On the other hand the summers\\nare hot and prolific in thunder storms. In Venetia, thanks to the\\ninfluence of the Adriatic, the climate is more equable. In the centre,\\nTuscany has a more nearly regular climate. From Naples south, one\\nencounters almost a North African temperature, and the south wind of the\\ndesert, the sirocco , here blows as it does in Algeria and Tunisia,\\nthough tempered somewhat by having crossed the Mediterranean.\\n\\nThere are a hundred and twenty-five varieties of mosquitoes in Italy,\\nbut with most of them their singing is worse than their stinging. The\\nPontine Marches have long been the worst breeding places for mosquitoes\\nknown to a suffering world. The mosquitoes of this region were supposed\\nto have been transmitters of malaria, so one day some Italian physicians\\ncaught a good round batch of them and sent them up into a little village\\nin the Apennines whose inhabitants had never known malaria. Straightway\\nthe whole population began to shake with the ague. That settled it, the\\nmosquito was a breeder of disease.\\n\\nThe topography of Italy is of an extraordinary variety. The plains and\\nwastes of Calabria are the very antitheses of that semi-circular\\nmountain rampart of the Alps which defines the northern frontier or of\\nthe great solid mass of the Apennines in Central Italy. Italy by no\\nmeans covers the vast extent of territory that the stranger at first\\npresupposes. From the northern frontier of Lombardy to the toe of the\\nCalabrian boot is considerable of a stretch to be sure, but for all that\\nthe actual area is quite restricted, when compared with that of other\\ngreat continental powers. This is all the more reason for the\\nautomobilist to go comfortably along and not speed up at every town and\\nvillage he comes to.\\n\\nThe automobilist in Italy should make three vows before crossing the\\nfrontier. The first not to attempt to see everything; the second to\\nreview some of the things he has already seen or heard of; and the third\\nto leave the beaten track at least once and launch out for himself and\\ntry to discover something that none of his friends have ever seen.\\n\\nThe beaten track in Italy is not by any means an uninteresting\\nitinerary, and there is no really unbeaten track any more. What one can\\ndo, and does, if he is imbued with the proper spirit of travel, is to\\ncover as much little-travelled ground as his instincts prompt him.\\nBetween Florence and Rome and between Rome and Naples there is quite as\\nmuch to interest even the conventional traveller as in those cities\\nthemselves, if he only knows where to look for it and knows the purport\\nof all the remarkable and frequent historical monuments continually\\nspringing into view. Obscure villages, with good country inns where the\\narrival of foreigners is an event, are quite as likely to offer\\npleasurable sensations as those to be had at the six, eight or ten franc\\na day pension of the cities.\\n\\nThe landscape motives for the artist, to be found in Italy, are the most\\nvaried of any country on earth. It is a wide range indeed from the\\nvineyard covered hillsides of Vicenza to the more grandiose country\\naround Bologna, to the dead-water lagoons before Venice is reached, to\\nthe rocky coasts of Calabria, or to the chestnut groves of \\u00c6tna and the\\nRoman Campagna.\\n\\nThe travelling American or Englishman is himself responsible for many of\\nthe inconveniences to which he is subjected in Italy. The Italian may\\nknow how to read his own class distinctions, but all Americans are alike\\nto him. Englishmen, as a rule, know the language better and they get on\\nbetter -- very little. The Frenchman and the German have very little\\ntrouble. They have less false pride than we.\\n\\nThe American who comes to Italy in an automobile represents untold\\nwealth to the simple Italian; those who drive in two horse carriages and\\nstop at big hotels are classed in the same category. One may scarcely\\nbuy anything in a decent shop, or enter an ambitious looking caf\\u00e9, but\\nthat the hangers-on outside mark him for a millionaire, while, if he is\\nso foolish as to fling handfuls of soldi to an indiscriminate crowd of\\nragamuffins from the balcony of his hotel, he will be pestered half to\\ndeath as long as he stays in the neighbourhood. And he deserves what he\\ngets! There is a way to counteract all this but each must learn it for\\nhimself. There is no set formula.\\n\\nBeggars are importunate in certain places in Italy be-ridden of\\ntourists, but after all no more so than elsewhere, and the travelling\\npublic, as much as anything else, conduces to the continued existence of\\nthe plague. If Italy had to choose between suppressing beggars or\\nforegoing the privilege of having strangers from overseas coming to view\\nher monuments she would very soon choose the former. If the beggars\\ncould not make a living at their little game they too would stop of\\ntheir own accord. The question resolves itself into a strictly personal\\none. If it pleases you to throw pennies from your balcony, your carriage\\nor your automobile to a gathered assembly of curious, do so! It is the\\nchief means of proving, to many, that they are superior to \\\"foreigners!\\\"\\nThe little-travelled person does this everywhere, -- on the terrace of\\nShepheard's at Cairo, on the boulevard caf\\u00e9 terraces at Algiers, from\\nthe deck of his ship at Port Said, from the tables even of the Caf\\u00e9 de\\nla Paix; -- so why should he not do it at Naples, at Venice, at Rome? For\\nno reason in the world, except that it's a nuisance to other travellers,\\ndecidedly an objectionable practice to hotel, restaurant and shop\\nkeepers, and a cause of great annoyance and trouble to police and civic\\nauthorities. The following pages have been written and illustrated as a\\ntruthful record of what two indefatigable automobile travellers have\\nseen and felt.\\n\\nWe were dutifully ravished by the splendours of the Venetian palaces,\\nand duly impressed by the massiveness of Sant'Angelo; but we were more\\npleased by far in coming unexpectedly upon the Castle of F\\u00e9nis in the\\nValle d'Aoste, one of the finest of all feudal fortresses; or the Castle\\nof Rimini sitting grim and sad in the Adriatic plain; or the Villa\\nCesarini outside of Perugia, which no one has ever reckoned as a\\nwonder-work of architecture, but which all the same shows all of the\\nbest of Italian villa elements.\\n\\nOur taste has been catholic, and the impressions set forth herein are\\nour own. Others might have preferred to admire some splendid church\\nwhilst we were speculating as to some great barbican gateway or watch\\ntower. A saintly shrine might have for some more appeal than a hillside\\nfortified Rocca ; and again some convent nunnery might have a\\nfascination that a rare old Renaissance house, now turned into a\\nmacaroni factory, or a wine press, might not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nOF ITALIAN MEN AND MANNERS\\n\\n\\nItalian politics have ever been a game of intrigue, and of the\\nexploiting of personal ambition. It was so in the days of the Popes; it\\nis so in these days of premiers. The pilots of the ships of state have\\nnever had a more perilous passage to navigate than when manoeuvring in\\nthe waters of Italian politics.\\n\\nThere is great and jealous rivalry between the cities of Italy. The\\nRoman hates the Piedmontese and the Neapolitan and the Bolognese, and\\nthey all hate the Roman, -- capital though Rome is of Church and State.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Evolution of Nationality has ever been an interesting subject to the\\nstranger in a strange land. When the national spirit at last arose Italy\\nhad reached modern times and become modern instead of medi\\u00e6val. National\\ncharacter is born of environment, but nationalism is born only of\\nunassailable unity, a thorough absorbing of a love of country. The\\ninhabitant of Rouen, the ancient Norman capital, is first, last and all\\nthe time a Norman, but he is also French; and the dweller in Rome or\\nMilan is as much an Italian as the Neapolitan, though one and all\\njealously put the Campagna, Piedmont, or the Kingdom of Naples before\\nthe Italian boot as a geographical division. Sometimes the same idea is\\ncarried into politics, but not often. Political warfare in Italy is\\nmostly confined to the unquenchable prejudices existing between the\\nQuirinal and the Vatican, a sort of inter urban warfare, which has\\nvery little of the aspect of an international question, except as some\\nnew-come diplomat disturbs the existing order of things. The Italian has\\na fondness for the Frenchman, and the French nation. At least the\\nItalian politician has, or professes to have, when he says to his\\nconstituency: \\\"I wish always for happy peaceful relations with France\\n... but I don't forget Magenta and Solferino.\\\"\\n\\nThe Italians of the north are the emigrating Italians, and make one of\\nthe best classes of labourers, when transplanted to a foreign soil. The\\nsteamship recruiting agents placard every little background village of\\nTuscany and Lombardy with the attractions of New York, Chicago, New\\nOrleans and Buenos Ayres, and a hundred or so lire paid into the\\nagent's coffers does the rest.\\nh\\nCalabria and Sicily are less productive. The sunny Sicilian always wants\\nto take his gaudily-painted farm cart with him, and as there is no\\neconomic place for such a useless thing in America, he contents himself\\nwith a twenty-hour sea voyage to Tunisia where he can easily get back\\nhome again with his cart, if he doesn't like it.\\n\\nEvery Italian peasant, man, woman and child, knows America. You may not\\npass the night at Barberino di Mugello, may not stop for a glass of wine\\nat the Osteria on the Futa Pass, or for a repast at some classically\\nnamed borgo on the Voie \\u00c6milia but that you will set up longings in+\\nthe heart of the natives who stand around in shoals and gaze at your\\nautomobile.\\n\\nThey all have relatives in America, in New York, New Orleans or Cripple\\nCreek, or perhaps Brazil or the Argentine, and, since money comes\\nregularly once or twice a year, and since thousands of touring Americans\\nclimb about the rocks at Capri or drive fire-spouting automobiles up\\nthrough the Casentino, they know the new world as a land of dollars, and\\ndream of the day when they will be able to pick them up in the streets\\npaved with gold. That is a fairy-tale of America that still lives in\\nItaly.\\n\\n \\n\\nBesides emigrating to foreign lands, the Italian peasant moves about his\\nown country to an astonishing extent, often working in the country in\\nsummer, and in the towns the rest of the time as a labourer, or artisan.\\nThe typical Italian of the poorer class is of course the peasant of the\\ncountryside, for it is a notable fact that the labourer of the cities is\\nas likely to be of one nationality as another. Different sections of\\nItaly have each their distinct classes of country folk. There are\\nlandowners, tenants, others who work their land on shares, mere\\nlabourers and again simple farming folk who hire others to aid them in\\ntheir work.\\n\\nThe braccianti , or farm labourers, are worthy fellows and seemingly as\\nintelligent workers as their class elsewhere. In Calabria they are\\nprobably less accomplished than in the region of the great areas of\\nworked land in central Italy and the valley of the Po.\\n\\nThe mezzadria system of working land on shares is found all over\\nItaly. On a certain prearranged basis of working, the landlord and\\ntenant divide the produce of the farm. There are, accordingly, no\\nstarving Italians, a living seemingly being assured the worker in the\\nsoil. In Ireland where it is rental pure and simple, and foreclosure and\\neviction if the rent is not promptly paid, the reverse is the case.\\nLandlordism of even the paternal kind -- if there is such a thing -- is\\nbad, but co-operation between landlord and tenant seems to work well in\\nItaly. It probably would elsewhere.\\n\\nThe average Italian small farm, or podere , worked only by the family,\\nis a very unambitious affair, but it produces a livelihood. The house is\\nnothing of the vine-clad Kent or Surrey order, and the principal\\napartment is the kitchen. One or two bedrooms complete its appointments,\\nwith a stone terrace in front of the door as it sits cosily backed up\\nagainst some pleasant hillside.\\n\\nThere are few gimcracks and dust-harbouring rubbish within, and what\\nsimple furniture there is is clean -- above all the bed-linen. The stable\\nis a building apart, and there is usually some sort of an out-house\\ndevoted to wine-pressing and the like.\\n\\nA kitchen garden and an orchard are near by, and farther afield the\\nlarger area of workable land. A thousand or twelve hundred lire a year\\nof ready money passing through the hands of the head of the family will\\nkeep father, mother and two children going, besides which there is the\\n\\\"living,\\\" the major part of the eatables and drinkables coming off the\\nproperty itself.\\n\\nThe Italians are as cleanly in their mode of life as the people of any\\nother nation in similar walks. Let us not be prejudiced against the\\nItalian, but make some allowance for surrounding conditions. In the\\ntwelfth century in Italy the grossness and uncleanliness were\\nincredible, and the manners laid down for behaviour at table make us\\nthankful that we have forks, pocket-handkerchiefs, soap and other\\nblessings! But then, where were we in the twelfth century!\\n\\nNo branch of Italian farming is carried on on a very magnificent scale.\\nIn America the harvests are worked with mechanical reapers; in England\\nit is done with sickle and flail or out of date patterns of American\\nmachines, but in Italy the peasant still works with the agricultural\\nimplements of Bible times, and works as hard to raise and harvest one\\nbushel of wheat as a Kansas farmer does to grow, harvest and market six.\\nThe American farmer has become a financier; the Italian is still in the\\nbread-winning stage. Five hundred labourers in Dakota, of all\\nnationalities under the sun, be it remarked, on the Dalrymple farm, cut\\nmore wheat than any five thousand peasants in Europe. The peasant of\\nEurope is chiefly in the stage of begging the Lord for his daily bread,\\nbut as soon as he gets out west in America, he buys store things,\\nautomatic pianos and automobile buggies. No wonder he emigrates!\\n\\nThe Italian peasant doesn't live so badly as many think, though true it\\nis that meat is rare enough on his table. He eats something more than a\\ngreasy rag and an olive, as the well-fed Briton would have us believe;\\nand something more than macaroni, as the American fondly thinks. For one\\nthing, he has his eternal minestra , a good, thick soup of many things\\nwhich Anglo-Saxons would hardly know how to turn into as wholesome and\\nnourishing a broth; meat of any kind, always what the French call pate\\nd'Italie , and herbs of the field. The macaroni, the olives, the cheese\\nand the wine -- always the wine -- come after. Not bad that; considerably\\nbetter than corned beef and pie, and far, far better than boiled mutton\\nand cauliflower as a steady diet! Britons and Americans should wake up\\nand learn something about gastronomy.\\n\\nThe general expenses of middle-class domestic town life in Italy are\\nlower than in most other countries, and the necessities for outlay are\\nsmaller. The Italian, even comfortably off in the working class, is less\\ninclined to spend money on luxurious trivialities than most of us. He\\nprefers to save or invest his surplus. One takes central Italy as\\ntypical because, if it is not the most prosperous, considered from an\\nindustrial point of view, it is still the region endowed with the\\ngreatest natural wealth. By this is meant that the conditions of life\\nare there the easiest and most comfortable.\\n\\nA middle class town family with an income of six or seven thousand lire\\nspends very little on rent to begin with; pretence based upon the size\\nof the front door knob cuts no figure in the Italian code of pride. This\\nfamily will live in a flat, not in a villini as separate town houses\\nare called. One sixth of the family income will go for rent, and though\\nthe apartment may be bare and grim and lack actual luxury it will\\npossess amplitude, ten or twelve rooms, and be near the centre of the\\ntown. This applies in the smaller cities of from twenty to fifty\\nthousand inhabitants. With very little modification the same will apply\\nin Rome or Naples, and, with perhaps none at all, at Florence.\\n\\nThe all important servant question would seem to be more easily solved\\nin Italy than elsewhere, but it is commonly the custom to treat Italian\\nservants as one of the family -- so far as certain intimacies and\\naffections go -- though, perhaps this of itself has some unanticipated\\nobjections. The Italian servants have the reputation of becoming like\\nfeudal retainers; that is, they \\\"stay on the job,\\\" and from eight to\\ntwenty-five lire a month pays their wages. In reality they become almost\\npersonal or body servants, for in few Italian cities, and certainly not\\nin Italian towns, are they obliged to occupy themselves with the\\nslogging work of the London slavey, or the New York chore-woman. An\\nItalian servant, be she young or old, however, has a seeming disregard\\nfor a uniform or badge of servitude, and is often rather sloppy in\\nappearance. She is, for that, all the more picturesque since, if untidy,\\nshe is not apt to be loathsomely dirty in her apparel or her manner of\\nworking.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Italian of all ranks is content with two meals a day, as indeed we\\nall ought to be. The continental morning coffee and roll, or more likely\\na sweet cake, is universal here, though sometimes the roll is omitted.\\nLunch is comparatively a light meal, and dinner at six or seven is\\nsimply an amplified lunch. The chianti of Tuscany is the usual wine\\ndrunk at all meals, or a substitute for it less good, though all red\\nwine in Italy seems to be good, cheap and pure. Adulteration is\\napparently too costly a process. Wine and biscuits take the place of\\nafternoon tea -- and with advantage. The wine commonly used en\\nfamille is seldom bought at more than 1.50 lira the flagon of two and a\\nhalf litres, and can be had for half that price. Sugar and salt are\\nheavily taxed, and though that may be a small matter with regard to salt\\nit is something of an item with sugar.\\n\\nWood is almost entirely the fuel for cooking and heating, and the latter\\nis very inefficient coming often from simple braziers or scaldini \\nfilled with embers and set about where they are supposed to do the most\\ngood. If one does not expire from the cold before the last spark has\\ndeparted from the already dying embers when they are brought in, he\\norders another and keeps it warm by enveloping it as much as possible\\nwith his person. Italian heating arrangements are certainly more\\neconomical than those in Britain, but are even less efficient, as most\\nof the caloric value of wood and coal goes up the chimney with the\\nsmoke. The American system of steam heat -- on the \\\" chauffage centrale \\\"\\nplan -- will some day strike Europe, and then the householder will buy his\\nheat on the water, gas and electric light plan. Till then southern\\nEurope will freeze in winter.\\n\\nIn Rome and Florence it is a very difficult proceeding to be able to\\ncontrol enough heat -- by any means whatever -- to properly warm an\\napartment in winter. If the apartment has no chimney, and many haven't\\nin the living rooms, one perforce falls back again on the classic\\n scaldini placed in the middle of the room and fired up with charcoal.\\nThen you huddle around it like Indians in a wigwam and, if you don't\\ntake a short route into eternity by asphyxiation, your extremities\\nultimately begin to warm up; when they begin to get chilly again you\\nrecommence the firing up. This is more than difficult; it is\\ninconvenient and annoying.\\n\\nThe manners and customs of the Italians of the great cities differ\\ngreatly from those of the towns and villages, and those of the Romans\\ndiffer greatly from those of the inhabitants of Milan, Turin or Genoa.\\nThe Roman, for instance, hates rain -- and he has his share of it too -- and\\naccordingly is more often seen with an umbrella than without one.\\nBrigands are supposedly the only Italians who don't own an umbrella,\\nthough why the distinction is so apparent a mere dweller beyond the\\nfrontier cannot answer.\\n\\nIn Rome, in Naples, and in all the cities and large towns of Italy, the\\npopulation rises early, but they don't get down to business as speedily\\nas they might. The Italian has not, however, a prejudice against new\\nideas, and the Italian cities and large towns are certainly very much\\nup-to-date. Italians are at heart democrats, and rank and title have\\nlittle effect upon them.\\n\\nThe Italian government still gives scant consideration to savings banks,\\nbut legalizes, authorizes and sometimes backs up lotteries. At all times\\nit controls them. This is one of the inconsistencies of the tunes played\\nby the political machine in modern Italy. Anglo-Saxons may bribe and\\ngraft; but they do not countenance lotteries, which are the greatest\\nthieving institutions ever invented by the ingenuity of man, in that\\nthey do rob the poor . It is the poor almost entirely who support\\nthem. The rich have bridge, baccarat, Monte Carlo and the Stock\\nExchange.\\n\\nIt may be bad for the public, this legalized gambling, but all gambling\\nis bad, and certainly state-controlled lotteries are no worse than\\nlicensed or unlicensed pool-rooms and bucket shops, winked-at\\ndice-throwing in bar rooms, or crap games on every corner.\\n\\nThe Italian administration received the enormous total of 74,400,000\\nlire for lottery tickets in 1906, and of this sum 35,000,000 lire were\\nreturned in prizes, and 6,500,000 went for expenses. A fine net profit\\nof 33,000,000 lire, all of which, save what stuck to the fingers of the\\nbureaucracy in passing through, went to reduce taxation which would\\notherwise be levied.\\n\\nThe Italian plays the lottery with the enthusiastic excitement of a too\\nshallow and too confident brain.\\n\\nVarious combinations of figures seem possible of success to the Italian\\nwho at the weekend puts some bauble in pawn with the hope that something\\nwill come his way. After the drawing, before the Sunday dawns, he is\\nquite another person, considerably less confident of anything to happen\\nin the future, and as downcast as a sunny Italian can be.\\n\\nThis passion for drawing lots is something born in him; even if\\nlotteries were not legalized, he would still play lotto in secret, for\\nin enthusiasm for games of chance, he rivals the Spaniard.\\n\\nBut Italy is not the country of illiterates that the stranger\\npresupposes. Campania is the province where one finds the largest number\\nof lettered, and Basilicate the least.\\n\\nMilitary service begins and is compulsory for all male Italians at the\\nage of twenty. It lasts for nineteen years, of which three only are in\\nactive service. The next five or six in the reserve, the next three or\\nfour in the Militia and the next seven in the \\\"territorial\\\" Militia, or\\nlandguard.\\n\\nConscription also applies to the naval service for the term of twelve\\nyears.\\n\\nThe military element, which one meets all over Italy, is astonishingly\\nresplendent in colours and plentiful in numbers. At most, among\\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of officers of all ranks, there can hardly\\nbe more than a few score of privates. It is either this or the officers\\nkeep continually on the move in order to create an illusion of numbers!\\n\\nClass distinctions, in all military grades, and in all lands, are very\\nmarked, but in Italy the obeisance of a private before the slightest\\nloose end of gold braid is very marked. The Italian private doesn't seem\\nto mark distinctions among the official world beyond the sight of gold\\nbraid. A steamboat captain, or a hall porter in some palatial hotel\\nwould quite stun him.\\n\\nThe Italian gendarmes are a picturesque and resplendent detail of every\\ngathering of folk in city, town or village. On a festa they shine more\\ngrandly than at other times, and the privilege of being arrested by such\\na gorgeous policeman must be accounted as something of a social\\ndistinction. The holding up of an automobilist by one of these gentry\\nis an affair which is regulated with as much pomp and circumstance as\\nthe crowning of a king. The writer knows!!\\n\\nJust how far the Italian's criminal instincts are more developed than\\nthose of other races and climes has no place here, but is it not fair to\\nsuppose that the half a million of Italians -- mostly of the lower\\nclasses -- who form a part of the population of cosmopolitan New York are\\nof a baser instinct than any half million living together on the\\npeninsula? Probably they are; the Italian on his native shore does not\\nstrike us as a very villainous individual.\\n\\nBut he is usually a lively person; there is nothing calm and sedentary\\nabout him; though he has neither the grace of the Gascon, the joy of the\\nKelt, or the pretence of the Proven\\u00e7al, he does not seem wicked or\\ncriminal, and those who habitually carry dirks and daggers and play in\\nBlack Hand dramas live for the most part across the seas.\\n\\nThe Italian secret societies are supposed hot beds of crime, and many of\\nthem certainly exist, though they do not practise their rites in the\\nfull limelight of publicity as they do in America.\\n\\nThe Neapolitan Camarra is the best organized of all the Italian secret\\nsocieties. It is divided, military-like, into companies, and is\\nrecruited, also in military fashion, to make up for those who have died\\nor been \\\"replaced.\\\"\\n\\nThe origin of secret societies will probably never be known. Italy was\\nbadly prepared to gather the fruits to be derived from the French\\nRevolution, and it is possible that then the activity of the Carbonari,\\nItaly's most popular secret society, began. The Mafia is more ancient\\nand has a direct ancestry for nearly a thousand years.\\n\\nA hundred and twenty-five years ago the seed of secret dissatisfaction\\nhad already been spread for years through Italy. The names of the\\nsocieties were many. Some of them were called the Protectori\\nRepublicani, the Adelfi, the Spilla Nera, the Fortezza, the Speranza,\\nthe Fratelli, and a dozen other names. On the surface the code of the\\nCarbonari reads fairly enough, but there is nothing to show that any\\nattempt was made to stamp out perhaps the most generally honoured of the\\ntraditions of Naples -- that of homicide.\\n\\nThe long political blight of the centuries, the curse of feudalism, the\\nrottenness of ignorance and superstition, had eaten out nearly every\\nvestige of political and self-respecting spirit. After the restoration\\nof the Bourbons the influences of the secret societies in Southern Italy\\nwere manifested by the large increase of murders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nCHIANTI AND MACARONI\\n\\n A Chapter for Travellers by Road or Rail \\n\\n\\nThe hotels of Italy are dear or not, according to whether one patronizes\\na certain class of establishment. At Trouville, at Aix-les-Bains in\\nFrance, at Cernobbio in the Italian Lake region, or on the Quai\\nParthenope at Naples, there is little difference in price or quality,\\nand the cuisine is always French.\\n\\nThe automobilist who demands garage accommodation as well will not\\nalways find it in the big city hotel in Italy. He may patronize the F.\\nI. A. T. Garages in Rome, Naples, Genoa, Milan, Florence, Venice, Turin\\nand Padua and find the best of accommodation and fair prices. For a\\ndemonstration of this he may compare what he gets and what he pays for\\nit at Pisa -- where a F. I. A. T. garage is wanting -- and note the\\ndifference.\\n\\nThe real Italian hotel, outside the great centres, has less of a\\nclient\\u00e8le of snobs and malades imaginaires than one finds in\\nFrance -- in the Pyrenees or on the Riviera, or in Switzerland among the\\nAlps, and accordingly there is always accommodation to be found that is\\nin a class between the resplendent gold-lace and silver-gilt\\nestablishments of the resorts and working-men's lodging houses. True\\nthere is the same class of establishment existing in the smaller cities\\nin France, but the small towns of France are not yet as much \\\"travelled\\\"\\nby strangers as are those of Italy, and hence the difference to be\\nremarked.\\n\\nThe real Italian hotels, not the tourist establishments, will cater for\\none at about one half the price demanded by even the second order of\\ntourist hotels, and the Italian landlord shows no disrespect towards a\\nclient who would know his price beforehand -- and he will usually make it\\nfavourable at the first demand, for fear you will \\\"shop around\\\" and\\nfinally go elsewhere.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe automobile here, as everywhere, tends to elevate prices, but much\\ndepends on the individual attitude of the traveller. A convincing air of\\nindependence and knowledge on the part of the automobilist, as he\\narrives , will speedily put him en rapport with the Italian landlord.\\nLook as wise as possible and always ask the price beforehand -- even\\nwhile your motor is still chugging away. That never fails to bring\\nthings to a just and proper relation.\\n\\nIt is at Florence, and in the environs of Naples, of all the great\\ntourist centres, that one finds the best fare at the most favourable\\nprices, but certainly at Rome and Venice, in the great hotels, it is far\\nless attractive and a great deal dearer, delightful though it may be to\\nsojourn in a palace of other days.\\n\\nThe Italian wayside inns, or trattoria , are not all bad; neither are\\nthey all good. The average is better than it has usually been given the\\ncredit of being, and the automobile is doing much here, as in France,\\ntowards a general improvement. A dozen automobiles, with a score or more\\nof people aboard, may come and go in a day to a little inn in some\\npicturesque framing on a main road, say that between Siena and Rome via\\nOrvieto, or to Finale Marina or Varazze in Liguria, to one carriage and\\npair with two persons and a driver. Accordingly, this means increased\\nprosperity for the inn-holder, and he would be a dull wit indeed if he\\ndidn't see it. He does see it in France, with a very clear vision; in\\nItaly, with a point of view very little dimmed; in Switzerland, when the\\ngovernmental authorities will let him; and in England, when the country\\nboniface comes anywhere near to being the intelligent person that his\\ncontinental compeer finds himself. This is truth, plain, unvarnished\\ntruth, just as the writer has found it. Others may have their own ideas\\nabout the subject, but this is the record of one man's experiences, and\\npresumably of some others.\\n\\nThe chief disadvantages of the hotel of the small Italian town are its\\noften crowded and incomplete accessories, and its proximity to a stable\\nof braying donkeys, bellowing cows, or an industrious blacksmith who\\nbegins before sun-up to pound out the same metallic ring that his\\nconfr\\u00e8res do all over the world. There is nothing especially Italian\\nabout a blacksmith's shop in Italy. All blacksmith interiors are the\\nsame whether painted by \\\"Old Crome,\\\" Eastman Johnson or Jean Fran\\u00e7ois\\nMillet.\\n\\nThe idiosyncrasies of the inns of the small Italian towns do not\\nnecessarily preclude their offering good wholesome fare to the\\ntraveller, and this in spite of the fact that not every one likes his\\nsalad with garlic in liberal doses or his macaroni smothered in oil.\\nEach, however, is better than steak smothered in onions or potatoes\\nfried in lard; any \\\"hygienist\\\" will tell you that.\\n\\nThe trouble with most foreigners in Italy, when they begin to talk about\\nthe rancid oil and other strange tasting native products, is that they\\nhave not previously known the real thing. Olive oil, real olive oil,\\ntastes like -- well, like olive oil. The other kinds, those we are mostly\\nused to elsewhere, taste like cotton seed or peanut oil, which is\\nprobably what they are. One need not blame the Italian for this, though\\nwhen he himself eats of it, or gives it you to eat, it is the genuine\\narticle. You may eat it or not, according as you may like it or not, but\\nthe Italian isn't trying to poison you or work off anything on your\\nstomach half so bad as the rancid bacon one sometimes gets in Germany or\\nthe kippers of two seasons ago that appear all over England in the small\\ntowns.\\n\\nAs before intimated, the chief trouble with the small hotels in Italy is\\ntheir deficiencies, but the Touring Club Italiano in Italy, like the\\nTouring Club de France in France, is doing heroic work in educating the\\ncountry inn-keeper. Why should not some similar institution do the same\\nthing in England and America? How many American country hotels, in towns\\nof three or five thousand people, in say Georgia or Missouri, would get\\nup, for the chance traveller who dropped in on them unexpectedly, a\\nsatisfactory meal? Not many, the writer fancies.\\n\\nThere is, all over Europe, a desire on the part of the small or large\\nhotel keeper to furnish meals out of hours, and often at no increase in\\nprice. The automobilist appreciates this, and has come to learn in Italy\\nthat the old Italian proverb \\\" chi tardi arriva mal alloggia \\\" is\\nentirely a myth of the guide books of a couple of generations ago. A\\ncold bird, a dish of macaroni, a salad and a flask of wine will try no\\ninn-keeper's capabilities, even with no notice beforehand. The Italian\\nwould seemingly prefer to serve meals in this fashion than at the\\n tavola rotonda , which is the Italian's way of referring to a table\\nd'h\\u00f4te . If you have doubts as to your Italian Boniface treating you\\nright as to price (after you have eaten of his fare) arrange things\\nbeforehand a prezzo fisso and you will be safe.\\n\\nAs for wine, the cheapest is often as good as the best in the small\\ntowns, and is commonly included in the prezzo fisso , or should be.\\nIt's for you to see that you get it on that basis of reckoning.\\n\\nThe padrona of an Italian country inn is very democratic; he believes\\nin equality and fraternity, and whether you come in a sixty-horse\\nMerc\\u00e9d\\u00e8s or on donkey-back he sits you down in a room with a mixed crew\\nof his countrymen and pays no more attention to you than if you were one\\nof them. That is, he doesn't exploit you as does the Swiss, he doesn't\\novercharge you, and he doesn't try to tempt your palate with poor\\nimitation of the bacon and eggs of old England, or the tenderloins of\\nAmerica. He gives you simply the fare of the country and lets it go at\\nthat.\\n\\nOf Italian inns, it may be truly said the day has passed when the\\ntraveller wished he was a horse in order that he might eat their food;\\noats being good everywhere.\\n\\nThe fare of the great Italian cities, at least that of the hotels\\nfrequented by tourists, has very little that is national about it. To\\nfind these one has to go elsewhere, to the small Italian hotels in the\\nlarge towns, along with the priests and the soldiers, or keep to the\\nbyways.\\n\\nThe polenta , or corn-meal bread, and the companatico , sardines,\\nanchovies or herrings which are worked over into a paste and spread on\\nit butter-wise, is everywhere found, and it is good. No osteria or\\n trattoria by the roadside, but will give you this on short order if\\nyou do not seek anything more substantial. The minestra , or cabbage\\nsoup -- it may not be cabbage at all, but it looks it -- a sort of \\\" omnium\\ngatherum \\\" soup -- is warming and filling. Polenta , companatico ,\\n minestra and a salad, with fromaggio to wind up with, and red wine\\nto drink, ought not to cost more than a lira, or a lira and a half at\\nthe most wherever found. You won't want to continue the same fare for\\ndinner the same day, perhaps, but it works well for luncheon.\\n\\nPay no charges for attendance. No one does anyway, but tourists of\\nconvention. Let the buono mano to the waiter who serves you be the\\nsole largess that you distribute, save to the man-of-all-work who brings\\nyou water for the thirsty maw of your automobile, or to the amiable,\\nsunshiny individual who lugs your baggage up and down to and from your\\nroom. This is quite enough, heaven knows, according to our democratic\\nideas. At any rate, pay only those who serve you, in Italy, as\\nelsewhere, and don't merely tip to impress the waiter with your\\nimportance. He won't see it that way.\\n\\nThe Italian albergo , or hotel of the small town, is apt to be poorly\\nand meanly furnished, even in what may be called \\\"public rooms,\\\" though,\\nindeed, there are frequently no public rooms in many more or less\\npretentious Italian inns. If there ever is a salon or reception room it\\nis furnished scantily with a rough, uncomfortable sofa covered with a\\ngunny sack, a small square of fibre carpeting (if indeed it has any\\ncovering whatever to its chilly tile or stone floor), and a few rush\\ncovered chairs. Usually there is no chimney, but there is always a\\nstuffy lambrequined curtain at each window, almost obliterating any rays\\nof light which may filter feebly through. In general the average\\nreception room of any Italian albergo (except those great joint-stock\\naffairs of the large cities which adopt the word hotel) is an\\nuncomfortable and unwholesome apartment. One regrets to say this but it\\nis so.\\n\\nBeds in Italian hotels are often \\\"queer,\\\" but they are surprisingly and\\ncomfortably clean, considering their antiquity. Every one who has\\nobserved the Italian in his home, in Italy or in some stranger land,\\neven in a crowded New York tenement, knows that the Italian sets great\\nstore by his sleeping arrangements and their proper care. It is an\\never-to-be-praised and emulated fact that the common people of\\ncontinental Europe are more frequently \\\"luxurious\\\" with regard to their\\nbeds and bed linen than is commonly supposed. They may eat off of an\\noilcloth (which by some vague conjecture they call \\\"American cloth\\\")\\ncovered table, may dip their fingers deep in the polenta and throw\\nbones on the tile or brick floor to the dogs and cats edging about their\\nfeet, but the draps of their beds are real, rough old linen, not the\\nninety-nine-cent-store kind of the complete house-furnishing\\nestablishments.\\n\\nThe tiled floor of the average Italian house, and of the kitchens and\\ndining room of many an Italian inn, is the ever at hand receptacle of\\nmuch refuse food that elsewhere is relegated to the garbage barrel.\\nBetween meals, and bright and early in the morning, everything is\\nflushed out with as generous a supply of water as is used by the Dutch\\n housvrou in washing down the front steps. Result: the microbes don't\\nrest behind, as they do on our own carpeted dining rooms, a despicable\\ncustom which is \\\"growing\\\" with the hotel keepers of England and America.\\nAnother idol shattered!\\n\\nWhat you don't find in the small Italian hotels are baths, nor in many\\nlarge ones either. When you do find a baignoir in Europe (except those\\nof the very latest fashion) it is a poor, shallow affair with a plug\\nthat pulls up to let the water out, but with no means of getting it in\\nexcept to pour it in from buckets. This is a fault, sure enough, and\\nit's not the American's idea of a bath tub at all, though it seems to\\nsuit well enough the Englishman en tour.\\n\\nFrance is, undoubtedly, the land of good cooks par excellence , but the\\nItalian of all ranks is more of a gourmet than he is usually accounted.\\nThere may be some of his tribe that live on bread and cheese, but if he\\nisn't outrageously poor he usually eats well, devotes much time to the\\npreparing and cooking of his meals, and considerably more to the eating\\nof them. The Italian's cooking utensils are many and varied and above\\nall picturesque, and his table ware invariably well conditioned and\\ncleanly. Let this opinion (one man's only, again let it be remembered)\\nbe recorded as a protest against the universally condemned dirty \\nItalian, who supposedly eats cats and dogs, as the Chinaman\\n supposedly eats rats and mice. We are not above reproach ourselves; we\\neat mushrooms, frog legs and some other things besides which are\\ncertainly not cleanly or healthful.\\n\\nMore than one Italian inn owes its present day prosperity to the travel\\nby road which frequently stops before its doors. Twenty-five years ago,\\nindeed much less, the vetturino deposited his load of sentimental\\ntravellers, accompanied perhaps by a courier, at many a miserable\\nwayside osteria , which fell far short of what it should be. To-day\\nthis has all changed for the better.\\n\\nTourists of all nationalities and all ranks make Italy their playground\\nto-day, as indeed they have for generations. There is no diminution in\\ntheir numbers. English minor dignitaries of the church jostle Pa and Ma\\nand the girls from the Far West, and Germans, fiercely and wondrously\\nclad, peer around corners and across lagoons with field glasses of a\\nsize and power suited to a Polar Expedition. Everybody is \\\"doing\\\"\\neverything, as though their very lives depended upon their absorbing as\\nmuch as possible of local colour, and that as speedily as possible. It\\nwill all be down in the bill, and they mean to have what they are paying\\nfor. This is one phase of Italian travel that is unlovely, but it is the\\nphase that one sees in the great tourist hotels and in the chief tourist\\ncities, not elsewhere.\\n\\nTo best know Italian fare as also Italian manners and customs, one must\\navoid the restaurants and trattoria asterisked by Baedeker and search\\nothers out for himself; they will most likely be as good, much cheaper,\\nmore characteristic of the country and one will not be eternally\\npestered to eat beefsteak, ham and saurkraut, or to drink paleale or\\nwhiskey. Instead, he will get macaroni in all shapes and sizes, and\\ntomato sauce and cheese over everything, to say nothing of rice,\\nartichokes and onions now and again, and oil, of the olive brand, in\\nnearly every plat . If you don't like these things, of course, there is\\nno need going where they are. Stick to the beefsteak and paleale then!\\nRomantic, sentimental Italy is disappearing, the Italians are becoming\\npractical and matter of fact; it is only those with memories of\\nBrowning, Byron, Shelley, Leopold Robert and Boeklin that would have\\nItaly sentimental anyway.\\n\\nMaximilien Mission, a Protestant refugee from France in 1688, had\\nsomething to say of the inns at Venice, which is interesting reading\\nto-day. He says: -- \\\"There are some good inns at Venice; the 'Louvre,' the\\n'White Lyon,' the 'Arms of France;' the first entertains you for eight\\nlivres (lire) per day, the other two somewhat cheaper, but you must\\nalways remember to bargain for everything that you have. A gondola costs\\nsomething less than a livre (lire) an hour, or for a superior looking\\ncraft seven or eight livres a day.\\\"\\n\\nThis is about the price of the Venetian water craft when hired to-day,\\ntwo centuries and more after. The hotel prices too are about what one\\npays to-day in the smaller inns of the cities and in those of the towns.\\nAll over Italy, even on the shores of the Bay of Naples, crowded as they\\nare with tourists of all nationalities and all ranks, one finds isolated\\nlittle Italian inns, backed up against a hillside or crowning some rocky\\npromontory, where one may live in peace and plenitude for six or seven\\nfrancs a day. And one is not condemned to eating only the national\\nmacaroni either. Frankly, the Neapolitan restaurateur often scruples as\\nmuch to put macaroni before his stranger guests as does the Bavarian\\ninn-keeper to offer sausage at each repast. Some of us regret that this\\nis so, but since macaroni in some form or other can always be had in\\nItaly, and sausages in Germany, for the asking, no great inconvenience\\nis caused.\\n\\nMacaroni is the national dish of Italy, and very good it is too, though\\nby no means does one have to live off it as many suppose.\\nNotwithstanding, macaroni goes with Italy, as do crackers with cheese.\\nThere are more shapes and sizes of macaroni than there are beggars in\\nNaples.\\n\\nThe long, hollow pipe stem, known as Neapolitan, and the vermicelli,\\nwhich isn't hollow, but is as long as a shoe string, are the leading\\nvarieties. Tiny grains, stars, letters of the alphabet and extraordinary\\nanimals that never came out of any ark are also fashioned out of the\\nsame pasta , or again you get it in sheets as big as a good sized\\nhandkerchief, or in piping of a diameter of an inch, or more.\\n\\nThe Romans kneaded their flour by means of a stone cylinder called a\\n maccaro . The name macaroni is supposed to have been derived from this\\norigin.\\n\\nNaples is the centre of the macaroni industry, but it is made all over\\nthe world. That made in Brooklyn would be as good as that made in Naples\\nif it was made of Russian wheat instead of that from Dakota. As it is\\nnow made it is decidedly inferior to the Italian variety. By contrast,\\nthat made in Tunis is as good as the Naples variety. Russian wheat\\nagain!\\n\\nA macaroni factory looks, from the outside, like a place devoted to\\nmaking rope. Inside it feels like an inferno. It doesn't pay to get too\\nwell acquainted with the process of making macaroni.\\n\\nThe flour paste is run out of little tubes, or rolled out by big\\nrollers, or cut out by little dies, thus taking its desired forms. The\\nlong, stringy macaroni is taken outside and hung up to dry like clothes\\non a line, except that it is hung on poles. The workmen are lightly and\\ninnocently clad, and the workshops themselves are kept at as high a\\ntemperature as the stoke-room of a liner. Whether this is really\\nnecessary or not, the writer does not know, but he feels sure that some\\ngenius will, some day, evolve a process which will do away with hand\\nlabour in the making of macaroni. It will be mixed by machinery, baked\\nby electricity and loaded up on cars and steamships by the same power.\\n\\nThe street macaroni merchants of Naples sell the long ropy kind to all\\ncomers, and at a very small price one can get a \\\"filling\\\" meal. You get\\nit served on a dish, but without knives, forks or chop sticks. You eat\\nit with your fingers and your mouth.\\n\\nThe meat is tough in Italy, often enough. There is no doubt about that.\\nBut it is usually a great deal better than it is given credit for being.\\nThe day is past, if it ever existed, when the Anglo-Saxon traveller was\\nforced to quit Italy \\\"because he could not live without good meat.\\\" This\\nwas the classic complaint of the innocents abroad of other days, whether\\nthey hailed from Kensington or Kalamazoo. They should never have left\\nthose superlatively excellent places. The food and Mazzini were the\\nsole topics of travel talk once, but to-day it is more a question of\\nwhether one can get his railway connection at some hitherto unheard of\\nlittle junction, or whether the road via this river valley or that\\nmountain pass is as good as the main road. These are the things that\\nreally matter to the traveller, not whether he has got to sleep in a\\nfour poster in a bedroom with a tile or marble floor, or eat macaroni\\nand ravioli when he might have -- if he were at home -- his beloved \\\"ham\\\"\\nand blood-red beefsteaks.\\n\\nThe Italian waiter is usually a sunny, confiding person, something after\\nthe style of the negro, and, like his dark-skinned brother, often\\nincompetent beyond a certain point. You like him for what he is though,\\nalmost as good a thing in his line as the French gar\\u00e7on, in that he is\\nobliging and a great deal better than the mutton-chopped, bewhiskered\\nnonentity who shuffles about behind your chair in England with his\\nexpectant palm forever outstretched.\\n\\nThe Italian cameri\\u00e8re , or waiter, takes a pride in his profession -- as\\nfar as he knows it, and quite loses sight of its commercial\\npossibilities in the technicalities of his craft, and his seeming desire\\nonly to please. Subito momento is his ever ready phrase, though often\\nit seems as though he might have replied never .\\n\\nSeated in some roadside or seashore trattoria one pounds on the bare\\ntable for the cameri\\u00e8re , orders another \\\"Torino,\\\" pays his reckoning\\nand is off again. Nothing extraordinarily amusing has happened the\\nwhile, but the mere lolling about on a terrace of a caf\\u00e9 overlooking the\\nlapping Mediterranean waves at one's feet is one of the things that one\\ncomes to Italy for, and one is content for the nonce never to recur to\\npalazzos, villas, cathedrals, or picture galleries. There have been too\\nmany travellers in past times -- and they exist to-day -- who do not seek to\\nfill the gaps between a round of churches and art galleries, save to\\nrush back to some palace hotel and eat the same kind of a dinner that\\nthey would in London, Paris or New York -- a little worse cooked and\\nserved to be sure. It's the country and its people that impress one most\\nin a land not his own. Why do so many omit these \\\"attractions?\\\"\\n\\nThe buona mano is everywhere in evidence in Italy, but the Italian\\nhimself seems to understand how to handle the question better than\\nstrangers. The Italian guest at a hotel is fairly lavish with the\\nquantity of his tips, but each is minute, and for a small service he\\npays a small fee. We who like to impress the waiter -- for we all do,\\nthough we fancy we don't -- will often pay as much to a waiter for\\nbringing us a drink as the price of the drink. Not so the Italian; and\\nthat's the difference.\\n\\nTen per cent, on the bill at a hotel is always a lavish fee, and five\\nwould be ample, though now and again the head waiter may look askance at\\nhis share. Follow the Italian's own system then, give everybody who\\nserves you something, however little, and give to those only, and then\\ntheir little jealousies between each other will take the odium off\\nyou -- if you really care what a waiter thinks about you anyway, which of\\ncourse you shouldn't.\\n\\nThese little disbursements are everywhere present in Italy. One pays a\\nfranc to enter a museum, a picture gallery or a great library, and one\\ntips his cabman as he does elsewhere, and a dozen francs spent in riding\\nabout on Venetian gondolas for a day incurs the implied liability for\\nanother two francs as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nITALIAN ROADS AND ROUTES\\n\\n\\nThe cordiality of the Italian for the stranger within his gates is\\nundeniable, but the automobilist would appreciate this more if the Latin\\nwould keep his great highways (a tradition left by the Romans of old,\\nthe finest road-builders the world has ever known) in better condition.\\n\\nItaly, next to France, is an ideal touring ground for the automobilist.\\nThe Italian population everywhere seems to understand the tourist and\\nhis general wants and, above all, his motive for coming thither, and\\nwhether one journeys by the railway, by automobile or by the more humble\\nbicycle, he finds a genial reception everywhere, though coupled with it\\nis always an abounding curiosity which is at times annoying. The native\\nis lenient with you and painstaking to the extreme if you do not speak\\nhis language, and will struggle with lean scraps of English, French and\\nGerman in his effort to understand your wants.\\n\\nAdmirably surveyed and usually very well graded, some of the most\\nimportant of the north and south thoroughfares in Italy have been lately\\nso sadly neglected that the briefest spell of bad weather makes them all\\nbut impassable.\\n\\nThere is one stretch between Bologna and Imola of thirty-two kilometres,\\nstraightaway and perfectly flat. It is a good road or a bad road,\\naccording as one sees it after six weeks of good weather or after a ten\\ndays' rainy spell. It is at once the best and worst of its kind, but it\\nis badly kept up and for that reason may be taken as a representative\\nItalian road. The mountain roads up back of the lake region and over the\\nAlpine passes, in time of snow and ice and rain -- if they are not\\nactually buried under -- are thoroughly good roads. They are built on\\ndifferent lines. Road-building is a national affair in Italy as it is in\\nFrance, but the central power does not ramify its forces in all\\ndirections as it does across the border. There is only one kind of\\nroad-building worth taking into consideration, and that is national\\nroad-building. It is not enough that Massachusetts should build good\\nroads and have them degenerate into mere wagon tracks when they get to\\nthe State border, or that the good roads of Middlesex should become mere\\nsloughs as soon as they come within the domain of the London County\\nCouncil. Italy is slack and incompetent with regard to her\\nroad-building, but England and America are considerably worse at the\\npresent writing.\\n\\nEntering Italy by the Riviera gateway one leaves the good roads of\\nFrance behind him at Menton and, between Grimaldi, where he passes the\\nItalian dogana and its formalities, and Ventimiglia, or at least San\\nRemo, twenty-five kilometres away, punctures his tires one, three or\\nfive times over a kilometre stretch of unrolled stone bristling with\\nflints, whereas in France a side path would have been left on which the\\nautomobilist might pass comfortably.\\n\\nIt isn't the Italian's inability to handle the good roads question as\\nsuccessfully as the French; it is his woefully incompetent, careless,\\nunthinking way of doing things. This is not saying that good roads do\\nnot exist in Italy. Far from it. But the good road in Italy suddenly\\ndescends into a bad road for a dozen kilometres and as abruptly becomes\\na good road again, and this without apparent reason. Lack of unity of\\npurpose on the part of individual road-building bodies is what does it.\\n\\nRoad-building throughout Italy never rose to the height that it did in\\nFrance. The Romans were great exploiters beyond the frontiers and often\\nleft things at home to shuffle along as best they might whilst their\\ngreatest energies were spent abroad.\\n\\nOne well defined Roman road of antiquity (aside from the tracings of the\\ngreat trunk lines like the Appian or \\u00c6milian Ways) is well known to all\\nautomobilists entering Naples via Posilippo. It runs through a tunnel,\\nalongside a hooting, puffing tram and loose-wheeled iron-tired carts all\\nin a deafening uproar.\\n\\nThis marvellous tunnelled road by the sea, with glimpses of daylight now\\nand then, but mostly as dark as the cavern through which flowed the\\nStyx, is the legitimate successor of an engineering work of the time of\\nAugustus. In Nero's reign, Seneca, the historian, wrote of it as a\\nnarrow, gloomy pass, and medi\\u00e6val superstition claimed it as the work of\\nnecromancy, since the hand of man never could have achieved it. The\\nfoundation of the roadway is well authenticated by history however. In\\n1442 Alphonso I, the Spaniard, widened and heightened the gallery, and\\nDon Pedro of Toledo a century later paved it with good solid blocks of\\ngranite which were renewed again by Charles III in 1754. Here is a good\\nroad that has endured for centuries. We should do as well to-day.\\n\\nThere are, of course, countless other short lengths of highway, coming\\ndown from historic times, left in Italy, but the Roman viae with which\\nwe have become familiar in the classical geographies and histories of\\nour schooldays are now replaced by modern thoroughfares which, however,\\nin many cases, follow, or frequently cut in on, the old itineraries. Of\\nthese old Roman Ways that most readily traced, and of the greatest\\npossible interest to the automobilist who would do something a little\\ndifferent from what his fellows have done, is the Via \\u00c6milia.\\n\\nWith Bologna as its central station, the ancient Via \\u00c6milia, begun by\\nthe Consul Marcus \\u00c6milius Lepidus, continues towards Cisalpine Gaul the\\nVia Flamina leading out from Rome. It is a delightfully varied itinerary\\nthat one covers in following up this old Roman road from Placentia\\n(Piacenza) to Ariminum (Rimini), and should indeed be followed leisurely\\nfrom end to end if one would experience something of the spirit of olden\\ntimes, which one can hardly do if travelling by schedule and stopping\\nonly at the places lettered large on the maps.\\n\\nThe following are the ancient and modern place-names on this itinerary:\\n\\n Placentia (Piacenza)\\n Florentia (Firenzuola)\\n Fidentia (Borgo S. Donnino)\\n Parma (Parma)\\n Tannetum (Taneto)\\n Regium Lepidi (Reggio)\\n Mutina (Modena)\\n Forum Gallorum (near Castel Franco)\\n Bononia (Bologna)\\n Claterna (Quaderna)\\n Forum Cornelii (Imola)\\n Faventia (Faenza)\\n Forum Livii (Forli)\\n Forum Populii (Forlimpopoli)\\n Caesena (Cesena)\\n Ad Confluentes (near Savignamo)\\n Ariminum (Rimini)\\n\\nConnecting with the Via \\u00c6milia another important Roman road ran from the\\nvalley of the Casentino across the Apennines to Piacenza. It was the\\nroute traced by a part of the itinerary of Dante in the \\\"Divina\\nCommedia,\\\" and as such it is a historic highway with which the least\\nsentimentally inclined might be glad to make acquaintance.\\n\\nAnother itinerary, perhaps better known to the automobilist, is that\\nwhich follows the Ligurian coast from Nice to Spezia, continuing thence\\nto Rome by the Via Aurelia. This coast road of Liguria passed through\\nNice to Luna on the Gulf of Spezia, the towns en route being as\\nfollows: -- \\n\\n Varium fl. The Var (river)\\n Nic\\u00e6 Nice\\n Cemenelium Cimiez, back of Nice\\n Portus Herculis Monoeci Monaco\\n Albium Intermelium Ventimiglia\\n Albium Ingaunum Albenga\\n Vada Sabbata Vado, near Savona\\n Genua Genoa\\n Portus Delphini Portofino\\n Tigullia Tregesco, near Sestri\\n Segesta Sestri\\n Portus Veneris Porto Venere\\n Portus Erici Lerici\\n\\nThe chief of these great Roman roadways of old whose itineraries can be\\ntraced to-day are:\\n\\n Via \\u00c6milia The most celebrated of N. Italy\\n Via \\u00c6milia-Scauri Built long after the original Via \\u00c6melia\\n Via Ameria From Rome to Amelia\\n Via Appia Of which the main trunk line ran from Rome to Capua\\n Via Aquilla\\n Via Ardentina\\n Via Aurelia From Rome to Pisa\\n Via Cassia\\n Via Flaminia The Great North Road of the Romans\\n Via Latina One of the most ancient of Roman roads\\n Via Laurentia\\n Via Ostiensis From Rome to Ostia\\n Via Salaria Leading from Rome through the valley of the Tiber\\n Via Valeria From the Tiber to the Adriatic at Ancona\\n\\nThese ancient Roman roads were at their best in Campania and Etruria.\\nCampania was traversed by the Appian Way, the greatest highway of the\\nRomans, though indeed its original construction by Appius Claudius only\\nextended to Capua. The great highroads proceeding from Rome crossed\\nEtruria almost to the full extent; the Via Aurelia, from Rome to Pisa\\nand Luna; the Via Cassia and the Via Clodia.\\n\\nThe great Roman roads were marked with division stones or bornes every\\nthousand paces, practically a kilometre and a half, a little more than\\nour own mile. These mile-stones of Roman times, many of which are still\\nabove ground ( milliarii lapides ), were sometimes round and sometimes\\nsquare, and were entirely bare of capitals, being mere stone posts\\nusually standing on a squared base of a somewhat larger area.\\n\\nA graven inscription bore in Latin the name of the Consul or Emperor\\nunder whom each stone was set up and a numerical indication as well.\\n\\nCaius Gracchus, away back in the second century before Christ, was the\\ninventor of these aids to travel. The automobilist appreciates the\\ndevelopment of this accessory next to good roads themselves, and if he\\nstops to think a minute he will see that the old Romans were the\\ninventors of many things which he fondly thinks are modern.\\n\\nThe automobilist in Italy has, it will be inferred, cause to regret the\\nabsence of the fine roads of France once and again, and he will regret\\nit whenever he wallows into a six inch deep rut and finds himself not\\nable to pull up or out, whilst the drivers of ten yoke ox-teams, drawing\\na block of Carrara marble as big as a house, call down the imprecations\\nof all the saints in the calendar on his head. It's not the\\nautomobilist's fault, such an occurrence, nor the ox-driver's either;\\nbut for fifty kilometres after leaving Spezia, and until Lucca and\\nLivorno are reached, this is what may happen every half hour, and you\\nhave no recourse except to accept the situation with fortitude and\\nrevile the administration for allowing a roadway to wear down to such a\\nstate, or for not providing a parallel thoroughfare so as to divide the\\ndifferent classes of traffic. There is no such disgracefully used and\\nkept highway in Europe as this stretch between Spezia and Lucca, and\\none must of necessity pass over it going from Genoa to Pisa unless he\\nstrikes inland through the mountainous country just beyond Spezia, by\\nthe Strada di Reggio for a d\\u00e9tour of a hundred kilometres or more,\\ncoming back to the sea level road at Lucca.\\n\\nThroughout the peninsula the inland roads are better as to surface than\\nthose by the coast, though by no means are they more attractive to the\\ntourist by road. This is best exemplified by a comparison of the inland\\nand shore roads, each of them more or less direct, between Florence and\\nRome.\\n\\nThe great Strada di grande Communicazione from Florence to Rome\\n(something less than three hundred kilometres all told, a mere mouthful\\nfor a modern automobile) runs straight through the heart of old Siena,\\nentering the city by the Porta Camollia and leaving by the Porta Romana,\\ntwo kilometres of treacherous, narrow thoroughfare, though readily\\nenough traced because it is in a bee-line. The details are here given as\\nbeing typical of what the automobilist may expect to find in the smaller\\nItalian cities. There are, in Italy, none of those unexpected\\nright-angle turns that one comes upon so often in French towns, at least\\nnot so many of them, and there are no cork-screw thoroughfares though\\nmany have the \\\"rainbow curve,\\\" to borrow Mark Twain's expression.\\n\\nOn through Chiusi, Orvieto and Viterbo runs the highroad direct to the\\ngates of Rome, for the most part a fair road, but rising and falling\\nfrom one level to another in trying fashion to one who would set a\\nsteady pace.\\n\\nIt is with respect to the grades on Italian roads, too, that one remarks\\na falling off from French standards. North of Florence, in the valley of\\nthe Mugello, we, having left the well-worn roads in search of something\\nout of the common, found a bit of seventeen per cent. grade. This was\\nnegotiated readily enough, since it was of brief extent, but another\\nrise of twenty-five per cent. (it looked forty-five from the cushions of\\na low-hung car) followed and on this we could do nothing. Fortunately\\nthere was a way around, as there usually is in Europe, so nothing was\\nlost but time, and we benefited by the acquisition of some knowledge\\nconcerning various things which we did not before possess. And we were\\ncontent, for that was what we came for anyway.\\n\\nFrom Florence south, by the less direct road via Arezzo, Perugia and\\nTerni, there is another surprisingly sudden rise but likewise brief. It\\nis on this same road that one remarks from a great distance the towers\\nof Spoleto piercing the sky at a seemingly enormous height, while the\\nbackground mountain road over the Passo della Somma rises six hundred\\nand thirty metres and tries the courage of every automobilist passing\\nthis way.\\n\\nTo achieve many of these Italian hill-towns one does not often rise\\nabruptly but rather almost imperceptibly, but here, in ten kilometres,\\nsay half a dozen miles, the Strada di grande Communicazione rises a\\nthousand feet, and that is considerable for a road supposedly laid out\\nby military strategists.\\n\\nAs a contrast to these hilly, switch-back roads running inland from the\\nnorth to the south may be compared that running from Rome to Naples, not\\nthe route usually followed via Vallombrosa and Frosinone, but that via\\nVelletri, Terracina and Gaeta. Here the highroad is nearly flat, though\\ntruth to tell of none too good surface, all the way to Naples.\\nPractically it is as good a road as that which runs inland and offers to\\nany who choose to pass that way certain delights that most other\\ntravellers in Italy know not of.\\n\\nAt Cisterna di Roma, forty-eight kilometres from Rome, one is in the\\nmidst of the Pontine Marshes it is true, and it is also more or less of\\na marvel that a decent road could have been built here at all. From this\\npoint of view it is interesting to the automobilist who has a hobby of\\nstudying the road-building systems of the countries through which he\\ntravels. Of the Pontine Marshes themselves it is certain that they are\\nnot salubrious, and malaria is most prevalent near them. Appius\\nClaudius, in 312 B. C., tried to drain the marsh and so did C\\u00e6sar,\\nAugustus and Theodoric after him, and the Popes Boniface VIII, Martinus\\nV and Sixtus V, but the morass is still there in spite of the fact that\\na company calling itself Ufficio della Bonificazione delle Paludi\\nPontine is to-day working continuously at the same problem.\\n\\nPutting these various classes of Italian roads aside for the moment\\nthere remains but one other variety to consider, that of the mountain\\nroads of the high Alpine valleys and those crossing the Oberland and,\\nfurther east, those in communication with the Austrian Tyrol. On the\\nwest these converge on Milan and Turin via the region of the lakes and\\nthe valleys of Aosta and Susa, and in the centre and east give\\ncommunication from Brescia, Verona and Venice with West Germany and\\nAustria.\\n\\n \\n\\nThese are the best planned and best kept roads in Italy, take them by\\nand large. The most celebrated are those leading from Turin into France;\\nvia Susa and the Col du Mont Genevre to Brian\\u00e7on, and via Mont Cenis to\\nModane and Grenoble; via the Val d'Aosta and the Petit Saint Bernard to\\nAlbertville in France, or via the Grand Saint Bernard to Switzerland.\\n\\nJust north of the Lago di Maggiore, accessible either from Como or from\\nMilan direct via Arona, is the famous road over the Simplon Pass, at an\\nelevation of 2,008 metres above the sea. By this road, the best road in\\nall Italy, without question, one enters or leaves the kingdom by the\\ngateway of Domodossola.\\n\\nOn entering Italy by this route one passes the last rock-cut gallery\\nnear Crevola and, by a high-built viaduct, thirty metres or more above\\nthe bed of the river, it crosses the Diveria. Soon the vineyards and all\\nthe signs of the insect life of the southland meet the eye. Italy has at\\nlast been reached, no more eternal snow and ice, no more peaked\\nrooftops, the whole region now flattens out into the Lombard plain.\\nDomodossola has all the ear-marks of the Italian's manner of life and\\nbuilding of houses, albeit that the town itself has no splendid\\nmonuments.\\n\\nAnother entrance to the Italian lake region through the mountain barrier\\nbeyond is by the road over the San Bernardino Pass and Bellinzona. The\\nSan Bernardino Pass is not to be confounded with those of the Grand and\\nPetit Saint Bernard. The present roadway dates from 1822, when it was\\nbuilt by the engineer Pocobelle, at the joint expense of the Sardinian\\nand Grisons governments. Its chief object was to connect Genoa and Turin\\ndirectly with Switzerland and west Germany. The pass crosses the\\nRheinwald at a height of 2,063 metres.\\n\\nThis passage across the Alps was known to the ancient Romans, and down\\nto the fifteenth century it was known as the Vogelberg. A mission\\nbrother, Bernardino of Siena, preaching the gospel in the high valleys,\\nerected a chapel here which gave the pass the name which it bears\\nto-day.\\n\\nIn part the road tunnels through the hillsides, in part runs along a\\nshelf beside the precipice, and here and there crosses a mountain\\ntorrent by some massive bridge of masonry.\\n\\nLike most of the mountain roads leading into Italy from Switzerland and\\nGermany the southern slope descends more abruptly than that on the\\nnorth. The coach driver may trot his horses down hill, though, so well\\nhas the descent been engineered, and the automobilist may rush things\\nwith considerably more safety here than on the better known routes.\\n\\nAnother celebrated gateway into Italy is that over the Splugen Pass from\\nCoire (in Italian nomenclature: Colmo dell'Orso). It was completed by\\nthe Austrian government in 1823 to compete with the new-made road a few\\nkilometres to the west over the Bernardino which favoured Switzerland\\nand Germany and took no consideration whatever of the interests of\\nAustria. The summit of the Splugen Pass is 2,117 metres above sea-level\\nand on a narrow ridge near by runs for six kilometres the boundary\\nbetween Switzerland and Italy.\\n\\nEntering Italy by the Splugen Pass one finds the dogana a dull, ugly\\ngroup of buildings just below the first series of facets which drop down\\nfrom the crest. It is as lonesome and gloomy a place of residence as one\\ncan possibly conceive as existing on the earth's surface. One forgets\\nentirely that it is very nearly the heart of civilized Europe; there is\\nnothing within view to suggest it in the least, not a scrap of\\nvegetation, not a silvery streak of water, not a habitation even that\\nmight not be as appropriately set upon a shelf of rock by the side of\\nHecla.\\n\\nThe French army under Mar\\u00e9chal Macdonald crossed the pass in 1800 when\\nbut a mere trail existed, but with a loss of a hundred men and as many\\nhorses.\\n\\nOf late years the passage of the Col has been rendered the easier by the\\ncutting of two long galleries. Another engineering work of note is met a\\nlittle farther on in the Gorge of San Giacomo, a work completed by Carlo\\nDonegani in the reign of the Emperor Francis II, and, just beyond, the\\nboiling torrent of the Liro is spanned by a daring bridge of masonry.\\n\\nRoad signs in Italy are not as good or as frequent as one finds in\\nFrance, but where they exist they are at least serviceable. The Roman\\nmilestone of old has ceased to serve its purpose, though solitary\\nexamples still exist, and their place is taken by the governmental\\n\\\"bornes\\\" and the placards posted at the initiation of the Touring Club\\nand various automobile organizations in certain parts, particularly in\\nthe north.\\n\\nThe signboards of the Touring Club Italiano are distinctly good as far\\nas they go, but they are infrequent.\\n\\nAll hotels and garages affiliated with the club hang out a\\ncharacteristic and ever welcome sign, and there one is sure of finding\\nthe best welcome and the best accommodations for man and his modern\\nbeast of burden, the mechanical horses of iron and bronze harnessed to\\nhis luxurious tonneau or limousine.\\n\\n \\n\\nWith regard to road maps for Italy there exist certain governmental maps\\nlike those of the Ordnance Survey in England or of the \\u00c9tat Major in\\nFrance, but they are practically useless for the automobilist, and are\\nonly interesting from a topographic sense.\\n\\nTaride, the French map publisher, issues a cheap series of Italian road\\nmaps, covering the entire peninsula in three sheets printed in three\\ncolours, with main roads marked plainly in red. They are easily read and\\nclear and have the advantage of being cheap, the three sheets costing\\nbut a franc each, but one suspects that they were not composed entirely\\nfrom first hand, well-authenticated, recent sources of information.\\nLittle discrepancies such as just where a railway crosses a road, etc.,\\netc., are frequently to be noted. This is perhaps a small matter, but\\nthe genuine vagabond tourist, whether he is plodding along on foot or\\nrolling smoothly on his five inch pneumatics, likes to know his exact\\nwhereabouts at every step of the way. On the whole the Italian \\\"Taride\\\"\\nmaps are fairly satisfactory, and they are much more easily read than\\nthe more elaborate series in fifty-six sheets on a scale of 1-1,250,000\\nissued by the Touring Club Italiano, or the thirty-five sheets of the\\nCarta Stradale d'Italia Sistema Becherel-Marieni, which by reason of the\\nnumber of sheets alone are in no way as convenient as the three sheet\\nmap.\\n\\nThe Becherel-Marieni maps are, however, beautifully printed and have a\\nsystem of marking localities where one finds supplies of gasoline, a\\nmechanician or a garage which is very useful to the automobilist,\\nbesides giving warning of all hills and, with some attempt at precision,\\nalso marking the good, mediocre and bad roads. This is important but, as\\nthe writer has so often found that a good road of yesterday has become a\\nbad road of to-day, and will be perhaps a worse one to-morrow, he\\nrealizes that the fluctuating quality of Italian roads prevents any\\ngenius of a map-maker from doing his best. These maps in seven colours\\nare perhaps the best works of their kind in Italy, at least ranking with\\nthe Touring Club maps, and completely cover the country, whereas the\\nother series is not as yet wholly complete.\\n\\n \\n\\nMembership in the great Touring Club Italiano is almost a necessity for\\none who would enjoy his Italian tour to the full. The \\\"Annuario,\\\" giving\\ninformation as to hotels and garages and miniature plans of all the\\ncities and principal towns -- presented gratis to members -- is all but\\nindispensable, while the three pocket volumes entitled Strade di Grande\\nCommunicazione, with the kilometric distances between all Italian places\\nexcept the merest hamlets and the profile elevations (miniature maps,\\nhundreds of them) of the great highways are a boon and a blessing to one\\nwho would know the easiest and least hilly road between two points. The\\naccompanying diagram explains this better than words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nIN LIGURIA\\n\\n\\nThe most ravishingly beautiful entrance into Italy is by the road along\\nthe Mediterranean shore. The French Riviera and its gilded pleasures,\\nits great hotels, its chic resorts and its entrancing combination of\\nseascape and landscape are known to all classes of travellers, but at\\nMenton, almost on the frontier, one is within arm's reach of things\\nItalian, where life is less feverish, in strong contrast to the French\\natmosphere which envelops everything to the west of the great white\\ntriangle painted on the cliff above the Pont Saint Louis and marking the\\nboundary between the two great Latin countries.\\n\\nThe \\\"Route Internationale,\\\" leading from France to Italy, crosses a deep\\nravine by the Pont Saint Louis with the railway running close beside.\\n\\nNot so very long ago there was a unity of speech and manners among the\\ninhabitants of Menton and the neighbouring Italian towns of Grimaldi,\\nMortola and Ventimiglia, but little by little the Ravine of Saint Louis\\nhas become a hostile frontier, where the custom house officials of\\nFrance and Italy regard each other, if not as enemies, at least as\\naliens. The two peoples are, however, of the same race and have the same\\nhistoric traditions.\\n\\nIt was just here, on passing the frontier, that we asked a deep-eyed,\\nsun-burnt young girl of eighteen or twenty if she was an Italian,\\nthinking perhaps she might be a Ni\\u00e7oise, who, among the world's\\nbeautiful women, occupy a very high place. She replied in\\nFrench-Italian: \\\"Oui, aussi bien Venitienne!\\\" This was strange, for most\\nVenetians, since Titian set the style for them, have been blondes.\\n\\nA ch\\u00e2teau of the Grimaldi family crowns the porphyry height just to the\\neastward of the Italian frontier, and below is the Italian Dogana ,\\nwhere the automobilist and other travellers by road go through the\\nformalities made necessary by governmental red tape. Red tape is all\\nright in the right place, but it should be cut off in proper lengths, so\\nthat officials need not be obliged to quibble over a few soldi while\\nindividuals lose a dozen francs or more in valuable time.\\n\\nThis matter of customs formalities at Grimaldi is only an incident. The\\nautomobilist's troubles really commence at a little shack in Menton, on\\nFrench soil, just before the Pont Saint Louis is crossed. Here he has\\nhis \\\"passavant\\\" made out, an official taking a lot of valuable time to\\ndecide whether the cushions of your automobile are red, orange or brown.\\nYou stick out for orange because they were that colour when you bought\\nthe outfit, but the representative of the law sticks out too -- he for\\nred. The result is, you compromise on brown, and hope that the other\\ncustoms guardian on duty at the frontier post by which you will enter\\nFrance again will be blessed with the same sense of colour-blindness as\\nwas his fellow of Menton. Once this formality gone through -- and you pay\\nonly two sous for the documents -- you have no trouble getting back into\\nFrance again by whichever frontier town you pass. There are no duties to\\npay and no disputes, so really one cannot complain. It is for his\\nbenefit anyway that the \\\"passavant\\\" describing the peculiarities of\\nautomobile is issued.\\n\\nAt the Grimaldi Dogana on entering Italy you are made to pay duty on\\nwhat little gasoline you may have in your tanks, even for as little as a\\nlitre. Presumably you pass your machine through the Italian customs\\nwith one of the \\\"triptyches\\\" issued by any of the great automobile clubs\\nor touring associations, as otherwise you have to put down gold, and a\\nthousand or fifteen hundred francs in gold one does not usually carry\\naround loose in his pocket. We passed through readily enough, but a poor\\nnon-French, non-Italian speaking American who followed in our\\nwheel-tracks had not made his preparations beforehand, and French\\nbanknotes didn't look good enough to the Italian customs official, and a\\nday was lost accordingly while the poor unfortunate rolled back down\\nhill to Menton and sought to turn the notes into gold. The banks having\\njust closed he was not able to do this as readily as he thought he\\nmight, and it was well on after sunrise that he followed our trail -- and\\nnever caught up with us all the way to Grosetto.\\n\\nMortola is the first town of note that one passes on entering Italian\\nsoil, but beyond its aspect, so alien to that of the small town in\\nFrance, it is not worthy of remark.\\n\\nVentimiglia comes next, where the traveller by rail goes through equally\\nannoying customs formalities to those experienced by the traveller by\\nroad at Grimaldi. These are not apt to be so costly, as the customs\\nofficials take him at his word, graciously chalk his luggage and pass\\nhim on. The Guardie-Finanze, or customs officer, of Italy is a genteel\\nlooking young person with a bowler hat, topped with a feather cockade.\\nHe is even as gay and picturesque as the \\\"carabinieri reales,\\\" though he\\nis a mere plebeian among the noblesse of soldierdom.\\n\\nThe Vintimille of the French, or the Ventimiglia of the Italians, was\\nthe ancient Intemilium of the Romans. To-day, on the left bank of the\\nRoja, is a new city made up of the attributes of a great railway and\\nfrontier station and a numerous assemblage of alberghi, hotels,\\nrestaurants and the like.\\n\\nVentimiglia is not unlovely, neither is it lovely in a picturesque\\nromantic sense. Its site is charming, on the banks of the tumbling Roja\\nat the base of the Alps of Piedmont, just where they plunge, from a\\nheight of a thousand or twelve hundred metres, down into the lapping\\nMediterranean waves.\\n\\nVentimiglia is, practically, the frontier town of Piedmont, and it was\\nfought for by all the warring houses of these parts in the middle ages.\\nThe Genoese held it for a time, then the Counts of Provence and the Duke\\nof Savoy. It was a game of give-and-take all round, and in the m\\u00eal\\u00e9e\\nmost of the town's medi\\u00e6val monuments have disappeared.\\n\\nAcross the Nervia, to the north, is Monte Appio, one of the chief spurs\\nof the Maritime Alps in Italy. On a jutting crag of rock, in plain view\\nfrom the town below, is an ancient Roman castellum . Two fragmentary\\ntowers alone remain, and as a ruin, even, it is beneath consideration.\\nOne only notices it in passing and recalls the more magnificent Tower of\\nAugustus at La Turbie, high above Monte Carlo's rock, and still in plain\\nview of Ventimiglia -- with a good glass.\\n\\nA fine relic of the Dorias -- that great family of great Genoese -- is still\\nto be seen in picturesque ruin at Dolce Acqua, a few miles further up\\nthe valley of the torrent.\\n\\nBordighera is the first of the Italian Riviera winter stations for\\ninvalids. That describes it perfectly. Its surroundings are delightful\\nenough, but there is little that is attractive about the place itself.\\nThe automobilist will have no trouble finding his way through the town\\nif he keeps straight on but drives carefully and avoids the invalids and\\nbaby carriages.\\n\\nIt was a sailor of Bordighera who gave the order to \\\"wet the ropes\\\" -- an\\nold seafaring trick, known the world over -- when the obelisk on the\\nPiazza san Pietro at Rome, erected by Sixte-Quint, was tottering on its\\nbase. In return for the service he asked the favour of the Pope that his\\nnative town should have the honour of supplying the churches of Rome\\nwith their greenery on Palm Sunday. The supplying of palm branches and\\nthe exploiting of semi-invalids are the chief industries of Bordighera.\\n\\nSan Remo is very like Bordighera, except that it is an improvement on\\nit. The quarter where the great hotels are found looks like all towns of\\nits class, but the old town with its narrow canyon-like streets, its\\nbuttressed roofs and walls, still breathes of the medi\\u00e6val spirit. It is\\nas crowded a quarter, where dwell men, women and children, -- seemingly\\nchildren mostly, -- as can be found east of Grand, Canal or Hester\\nStreets, in down-town New York. The automobile tourist will not care\\nmuch for San Remo unless he is hungry, in which case the Hotel de Paris\\nwill cater for him a little better than any other of the town's resort\\nhotels.\\n\\nThe road continues close beside the sea, as it has since Fr\\u00e9jus in the\\nVar was passed, sweeping around bold promontories on a shelf of rock,\\ntunnelling through some mountain spur, dipping down to sea-level here\\nand rising three or five hundred metres ten kilometres further on.\\n\\nThis delightfully disposed road by the sea may well be reviled by the\\nautomobilist because of the fact that every half dozen kilometres or so\\nit crosses the railway at the same level. These level crossings are\\nabout as dangerous as the American variety; in a way more so. They are\\nbarred simply by a great swinging tree-trunk, which, of all things,\\nswings outwards and across the road when not in use. Even when closed\\nthis bar is so placed that an automobile at speed could well enough slip\\nbeneath it, and the passengers who were not thrown out and killed by\\nthis operation surely would be by the train which would probably come\\nalong before they could pick themselves up.\\n\\nThese railway barriers are almost always closed, whether a train is due\\nor not, and it is commonly said that they are only opened for the\\nautomobilist on the payment of a few soldi. This, the writer knows to be\\ncalumny. It is conceivable that the circumstance has been met with, and\\nit is conceivable that, in many more instances, stranger automobilists\\nhave scattered coin in their wake which led to the development of the\\npractice, but all the same one need not, should not, in fact,\\ncountenance any such practice of blackmail. The mere fact that these\\nobstructions are there is enough of a penance for the automobilist, who\\nin ten hours of running will certainly lose one or two hours waiting for\\nthe gates to be opened.\\n\\nThese Italian coast line vistas are quite the most savagely beautiful of\\nany along the Mediterranean. We rave over the strip dominated by La\\nTurbie and Monte Carlo's rock, and over the Corniche d'Or of the Est\\u00e9rel\\nin France, but really there is nothing quite so primitive and unspoiled\\nin its beauty as this less-known itinerary. The background mountains\\nrise, grim, behind, and beneath. At the bottom of the cliff, a hundred\\nmetres below the road on which you ride, break the soapy waves of the\\nsea. Gulls circle about uttering their shrill cries, an eagle soars\\nabove, and far below a fisherman pushes lazily at his oar in the\\nconventional stand-up Mediterranean fashion, or a red-brown\\nlatteen-rigged fishing boat darts in or out of some half-hidden bay or\\n calanque . The whole poetic ensemble is hard to beat, and yet this part\\nof the average Italian journey is usually rolled off in express trains,\\nwith never a stop between the frontier and Genoa, most of the time\\npassing through the fifty rock-cut tunnels which allow the railway\\naccess to these parts. To see this wonderful strip of coast line at its\\nbest it must be seen from the highroad.\\n\\nAt Arma, as the road runs along at the water's very edge, is an old\\nsquare donjon tower, reminding one of those great keeps of England and\\nof Foulque's Nerra in Normandy. Its history is lost in oblivion, but it\\nis a landmark to be noted.\\n\\nPorto Maurizio is the very ideal of a small Mediterranean sea-port. It\\nis a hill-top town too, in that it crowns a promontory jutting seawards,\\nforming a sheltering harbour for its busy coming and going of small-fry\\nshipping.\\n\\nOlive oil and a sweet white wine, like that of Cyprus, grown on the\\nhillsides roundabout, form the chief of the merchandise sent out from\\nthe little port; but the whole town bears a prosperous well-kept air\\nthat makes one regret that it had not a battery of \\\"sights,\\\" in order\\nthat one might linger a while in so pleasant a place. Porto Maurizio's\\nchurch is a remarkably vast and handsome building.\\n\\nOneglia, the birthplace of the great Genoese admiral, Andrea Doria, lies\\njust beyond. Wine in skins, hung up on rafters to mellow, seems to be\\nOneglia's substitute for wine cellars, but otherwise the hurried\\ntraveller at Oneglia remarks nothing but that it is a \\\"resort\\\" with big\\nhotels and big gardens and many guests lolling about killing time. The\\nolder part of the town, with the wine skins, is decidedly the most\\ninteresting feature.\\n\\nAt Marina-Andora is the ruin of an old castle with a ghostly legend to\\nit to add an attraction it might not otherwise have. A Papal Nuncio was\\none day murdered here within its walls and \\\"in extremis\\\" the prelate\\ncalled down curses upon the surrounding country, praying that it might\\nwither and dry up. It must have been an efficacious imprecation as the\\ncountry roundabout looks like a desert waste. Not an olive nor an orange\\ngrove is in sight and only a few scrubby vineyards dot the landscape.\\n\\nAt the Capo delle Melle, a dozen kilometres beyond, it all changes and\\nthe land blossoms again, though truth to tell both the wine and olive\\nproducts have the reputation of falling off in quality as one goes\\nfurther east.\\n\\nAlassio is a now well-developed Italian seaside resort. The Italians and\\nthe Germans fill it to overflowing at all seasons of the year, and\\nprices are mounting skywards with a rapidity which would do credit to\\nMonte Carlo itself. There is a considerable fishing and coastwise trade\\nat Alassio which along the quais endows it with a certain\\npicturesqueness, and the chief hotel is quartered in a seventeenth\\ncentury palazzo, formerly belonging to the Marchese Durante. Alassio\\ntook its name from Alassia, a daughter of Otho the Great, who, fleeing\\nfrom the paternal roof, came here with her lover long years ago. This\\nwas the beginning of the development of Alassio as a Mediterranean\\nresort. And the Germans have been coming in increasing numbers ever\\nsince.\\n\\nOff shore is the isle of Gallinaria. It has a circular tower on it, and\\na legend goes with it that the name of the island is derived from a\\nspecies of hens and chickens which were bred here. The connection seems\\na little vague, but for the sake of variation, it is here given.\\n\\nHere and there as the road winds along the coast some vine-clad ruin of\\na castle tower is passed, and the background foot-hills of the Alps are\\npeopled with toy villages and towns like Switzerland itself.\\n\\nAlbenga is primarily a great big overgrown coast town of to-day, but was\\nformerly the ancient metropolis of a minor political division of\\nLiguria, and the one time ally of Carthage. Evidences of this fallen\\npride of place are not wanting in Albenga to-day. There are innumerable\\ngreat brick and stone towers, now often built into some surrounding\\nstructure. Three may be remarked as landmarks of the town's great civic\\nand military glory of the past: the Torre de Marchese Malespina, the\\nTorre dei Guelfi, and another, unnamed, built up into the present Casa\\ndel Commune.\\n\\nAlbenga is not a resort, since it has the reputation of being an\\nunhealthful place, but probably this is not so as there is no particular\\nsqualidness to be noticed, save that incident to the workaday affairs of\\nfactories, workshops and shipping. The inhabitants of the neighbouring\\ntowns profess to recognize the native of Albenga at a glance when they\\nhail him with the remark: \\\"Hai faccia di Albenga.\\\" -- \\\"You have the\\nAlbenga face.\\\" This is probably local jealousy only, and is not really\\ncontempt.\\n\\nA short way out from Albenga is the Ponte Lungo, an old Roman bridge of\\nthe time of the Emperor Honorius. Savona, the largest place between the\\nfrontier and Genoa, is still fifty kilometres to the eastward, but\\nmidway between it and Albenga is Finale Marina, a town of one main\\nstreet, two enormous painted churches, an imposing fortification wall, a\\npalm-planted promenade and a municipal palace bearing, over its portal,\\nthe arms of a visiting Spanish monarch who ruled here temporarily in the\\nfifteenth century.\\n\\nThe Castello Gavone, on a hillside above the town and back from the\\ncoast, is a ruin, but its picturesque outer walls, with diamond-cut\\nstone facets, like those of the great round tower of Milan or of\\nTantallon Castle in Scotland, are quite remarkable.\\n\\nFinale Marina's Albergo Grimaldi is housed in an old ch\\u00e2teau of some\\nnoble of the days when the town was the capital of a Marquisate. Not\\nmuch changed is the old ch\\u00e2teau, except to put new wine in the old\\nbottles and new linen on the antique beds. To be sure there are electric\\npush-buttons in the chambers, but as they are useless they can hardly be\\ntaken into consideration.\\n\\nThe Albergo Grimaldi has scant accommodation for automobiles. Three\\nmight range themselves along the wall in the lower corridor, and would\\nindeed be well enough housed, though in no sense is there the least\\nsemblance of a garage. You pay nothing additional for this, and that's\\nsomething in Italy where automobiles -- in the small towns -- are still\\nregarded as mechanical curiosities and their occupants as fanatics with\\nmore money than good sense. The Italian country population is by no\\nmeans hostile to the automobilist, but their good nature, even, is often\\nexasperating.\\n\\nFinale Marina is the best stopping place between Menton and Genoa if one\\nis travelling by road, and would avoid the resorts.\\n\\nNoli, just beyond the Capo di Noli, is an unimportant small town;\\nnevertheless it is the proud possessor of a collection of ruined walls\\nand towers which would be a pride to any medi\\u00e6val \\\"borgo.\\\" Noli, like\\nAlbenga, was once the chief town of a little political division; but\\nto-day it is a complete nonentity.\\n\\nIn bright sunshine, from the road winding over the Capo di Noli, one may\\nsee the smoke of Genoa's chimneys and shipping rising, cloud-like, on\\nthe horizon far away to the eastward, and may even descry that classic\\nlandmark, the great lighthouse called \\\"La Lanterna\\\" at the end of the\\nmole jutting out between San Pier d'Arena and Genoa.\\n\\nA castle-crowned rocky islet, the Isola dei Bergeggi, lies close off\\nshore beneath the Capo di Vado, itself crowned with a seventeenth\\ncentury fortress cut out of the very rock.\\n\\nStill following the rocky coastline, one draws slowly up on Savona.\\nSavona is backed up by olive gardens and pine-clad hills, while above,\\naway from the coast, roll the first foot-hills of the Apennines, their\\nnearby slopes and crests dotted, here and there, with some grim fortress\\nof to-day or a watch tower of medi\\u00e6val times. The Alps are now dwindling\\ninto the Apennines, but the change is hardly perceptible.\\n\\nAbove the roofs and chimneys of the town itself rises an old tower of\\nmasonry on which is perched a colossal madonna, a venerated shrine of\\nthe Ligurian sailor-folk. It bears an inscription which seems to scan\\nequally well in school-book Latin or colloquial Italian.\\n\\n \\\"In mare irato, in subita procella\\n Invoco te, nostra benigna stella.\\\"\\n\\nMago, the Carthaginian, made Savona a refuge after his sack of Genoa.\\nThe Genoese, in turn, came along and blocked up the port out of sheer\\njealousy, lest it might become a commercial rival of Genoa itself.\\n\\nThe bay of Savona is delightful, even Wordsworth, who mostly sang of\\nlakes and larks, remarked it, though in no way is it superior in beauty\\nto a score of other indentations in the Mediterranean coastline from\\nMarseilles around to Naples.\\n\\nThe automobilist will best remember Savona for its exceedingly bad\\nexits and entrances, and the clean and unencumbered streets in the town\\nitself. Here are great wide park-like thoroughfares flagged with flat\\nsmooth stones which are a dream to the automobilist. There never were\\nsuch superbly laid paving blocks as one finds in Savona.\\n\\nAs one leaves Savona he actually begins to sense the smoke and\\nactivities of Genoa in his nostrils, albeit they are a good fifty\\nkilometres away as yet; around a half a dozen jutting barrier capes, and\\nacross innumerable railway tracks.\\n\\nVarazze is not a stopping point on many travellers' Italian journeyings\\nand, to state it frankly, perhaps, for the majority, it is not worth\\nvisiting. It is a sort of overflow Sunday resort for the people of\\nGenoa, in that each of its two hotels have dining accommodation for a\\nhundred people or more. Aside from this it is endowed with a certain\\nquaint picturesqueness. It has a palm-tree-lined quay which borders a\\nstring of ship-building yards where the wooden walls of Genoa's\\ncommerce-carrying craft were formerly built in large numbers, and where,\\nto-day, a remnant of this industry is still carried on. Great\\nlong-horned white oxen haul timber through the crooked streets and\\nalong the quays, and there is ever a smell of tar and the sound of\\nsawing and hammering. An artist with pen or brush will like Varazze\\nbetter than any other class of traveller. The automobilist will have all\\nhe can manage in dodging the ox teams and their great trundling loads of\\ntimber.\\n\\nThere is a fragment of a ruined castle near by on the outskirts of the\\ntown, and farther away, back in the hills, is a monastery called \\\"Il\\nDeserto,\\\" and properly enough named it is. It was founded by a lady of\\nthe Pallavicini family who as a recompense -- it is to be\\npresumed -- insisted on being represented in the painted altar-piece as\\nthe Madonna, though clad in medi\\u00e6val Genoese dress. What vanity!\\n\\nCogoletto, practically a Genoese suburb, claims to be the birth place of\\nColumbus. Perhaps indeed it is so, as his father Dominico was known to\\nbe a property owner near Genoa. Savona, Oneglia and Genoa itself all\\nhave memories of the family, so the discoverer was of Ligurian parentage\\nwithout doubt.\\n\\n\\\"Sestri-Ponente! Cornigliano-Ligure! San Pier d'Arena!\\\" (with its Villa\\nSerra and its Babylonian-like gardens) cry out the railway employees at\\neach stop of the Genoa-bound train; and the same names roll up on the\\nautomobilist's road map with a like persistency. Each class of\\ntraveller wonders why Genoa is not reached more quickly, and the\\nautomobilist, for the last dozen kilometres, has been cursed with a most\\nexasperating, always-in-the-way tramway, with innumerable carts, badly\\npaved roads and much mud. The approaches to almost all great cities are\\nequally vile; Genoa is no exception and the traffic in the city -- and in\\nall the built up suburbs -- keeps to the left , a local custom which is\\ninexplicable since in the open country it goes to the right.\\n\\nVoltri is a long drawn-out, uninteresting, waterside town with more\\nchimneys belching smoke and cinders in strong contrast to the pine-clad\\nbackground hills, in which nestle the suburban villas of the Doria, the\\nGalliera and the Brignole families of other days.\\n\\nPegli is but a continuation of Voltri, Genoa La Superba is still a dozen\\nkilometres away. Pegli is a resort of some importance and its chief\\nattraction is the Villa Pallavicini, with a labyrinth of grottoes,\\nsubterranean lakes, cement moulded rocks, Chinese pagodas and the like.\\nIt is not lovely, but is commonly reckoned a sight worth stopping off to\\nsee. The Italians call this hodge podge \\\"a ferocity of invention.\\\" The\\nphrase is worthy of perpetuation.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Pallavicini was the suburban residence of the banker of the\\nCourt of Rome, but he was a sort of renegade financier, for he went off\\nto England with the churchly funds and became an English country\\ngentleman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. His \\\"past\\\" was known, for\\nsome poet-historian of the time branded him with the following\\ncouplet: -- \\n\\n \\\"Sir Horatio Palvasene,\\n Who robbed the Pope to pay the Queen.\\\"\\n\\nThe Villa Doria at Pegli was a work of Canzio built for one of the\\nrichest merchants of Genoa in the days of Charles V. It was, like its\\ncontemporaries, a gorgeous establishment, but in popular fancy it enjoys\\nnot a whit of the enthusiasm bestowed upon the stagy, tricky bric-\\u00e0-brac\\nand stucco Villa Pallavicini.\\n\\nThe entrance to \\\"Genoa la Superba\\\" by road from the west is a sorry\\nspectacle, a grim, crowded thoroughfare decidedly workaday and none too\\ncleanly. From San Pier d'Arena one comes immediately within the confines\\nof Genoa itself, just after circling the western port and passing the\\nsky-piercing \\\"La Lanterna,\\\" one of the most ancient lighthouses extant,\\ndating from 1547.\\n\\n \\n\\nGenoa is neglected or ignored by most travellers and searchers after the\\npicturesque in Italy. This is a mistake, for Genoa's park of Acquasola,\\nthe gardens of the Villa Rosazza and of the Villa de Negroni, and the\\nterraces of the Palazzo Doria offer as enchanting a series of panoramas\\nas those of Rome or Florence, and quite different, in that they have\\nalways the vista of the blue Mediterranean as a background.\\n\\n \\n\\nGenoa is a bizarre combination of the old and the new, of the mountain\\nand the plain, of great docks and wharves, and of streets of stairs\\nrising almost vertically.\\n\\nThe general effect of Genoa is as if everything in it had been piled one\\non top of another until finally it had to spread out at the base.\\nEnormous caserns fringe the heights and great barracks line the wharves,\\nwhile in between, and here, there and everywhere, are great and\\nvenerable palaces and churches of marble, many of them built in layers\\nof black and white stone, indicating that they were built by the commune\\nin medi\\u00e6val days, or by one of the four great families of Doria,\\nGrimaldi, Spinola or Fieschi, the only ones who had the privilege of\\nusing it.\\n\\nGenoa's labyrinth of twisting, climbing streets and alleys are all but\\nimpracticable for wheeled traffic, and, for that reason, strangers, who\\ndo not walk \\\"en tour\\\" as much as they ought, save in the corridors of\\npicture galleries and the aisles of churches, know not Genoa save its\\nmain arteries -- nor ever will, unless they change their tactics.\\n\\nThe automobile is only useful in Genoa in getting in and out of town,\\nand even that is accomplished with fear and trembling by the most\\ncold-blooded chauffeur that ever lived. What with the vile roads, the\\nmagnificent distances and the ceaseless irresponsible traffic of carts\\nand drays, tramways and what not, Genoa is indeed, of all other cities\\non earth, in need of a boulevard for the new traffic. To get to your\\nhotel at the further end of the town as you make your entrance by the\\nroad circling the base of \\\"La Lanterna,\\\" can only be likened to a trip\\ndown Broadway in New York at four o'clock in the afternoon. That would\\nnot be pleasure; neither is getting in and out of Genoa at any time\\nbetween five in the morning and seven at night.\\n\\nTo what degenerate depths these great palaces of the Genoa of other days\\nhave fallen only the curious and inquisitive are likely to know. One\\ninto which we penetrated -- looking for something which wasn't there -- was\\na veritable hive of industry, and as cosmopolitan as Babylon. It was\\nnear the Bourse and one entered marble halls by a marble staircase,\\nflanked by a marble balustrade and finished off with newel posts\\nsupported by marble lions. The great entrance hall was surrounded by a\\ncolonnade of svelt marble columns, and in the centre ascended a\\nmonumental marble staircase. Two marble fountains played in an inner\\ncourtyard, which was paved with marble flags, and a statue, also marble,\\nin a niche faced the great doorway.\\n\\nOn the first floor were more marble columns and a frescoed vaulting.\\nFrom the corridors opened a battery of doors into offices of all sorts\\nof industrial enterprises, from one given to exploiting a new\\ncombustible to another which was financing a rubber plantation in\\nAbyssinia. A chestnut-roaster was perambulating the corridors with his\\nstock in trade, furnace all alight, and a brown-robed monk was begging\\nhis daily bread.\\n\\nOn the next floor, up another marble staircase, were still other\\nbusiness offices, -- shipping firms, wine-factors and one Guiseppe\\nBellini, representing an American factory, whose output of agricultural\\nmachinery is found in all four quarters of the globe. Breakfast foods\\nwere there, too, and there was a big lithograph of a Fall River Line\\nSteamer on the walls. A whole city of merchants and agents were\\ncloistered here in the five stories of this one-time ducal abode.\\n\\nUp under the roof was a photographer and an artist's studio, where a\\nlong-haired Italian (Signor something or other, the sign read) painted\\nthe bluest of blue sky pictures, and the most fiery Vesuvian eruptions,\\nto sell to tourists through the medium of the hotel porters of the town\\nbelow.\\n\\nThus it was that an antique shrine of gallantry and romance had become\\nthe temple of twentieth century commerce. The noble arms, with a\\nheraldic angel still to be seen over the entrance doorway, count for\\nnothing to-day, but exist as a vivid reminder of a glorious past. In\\n1500 the palace was the shrine of an artistic nobility; to-day it is a\\ntemple of chicanery.\\n\\nThe new part of Genoa imitates Milan, as Milan imitates Paris. The\\ngalleries or arcades of Milan, Genoa and Naples, full of shops, caf\\u00e9s\\nand restaurants, would be admirable institutions in a more northerly\\nclime, where the sun is less strong and rain more frequent. Here their\\nglass roofs radiate an insufferable heat, which only in the coldest and\\nmost intemperate months is at all bearable. Nevertheless these arcades\\nare an amusing and characteristic feature of the large Italian cities.\\n\\nHotels in Genoa for the automobilist are of all ranks and at all prices.\\nBertolini's has garage accommodation for twenty-five automobiles, and\\ncharges two francs and a half to four francs a night for the\\naccommodation, which is dear or not accordingly as you may feel.\\n\\nThe Albergo Unione, on the Palazzo Campetto, has no garage (you will\\nhave to seek out the F. I. A. T. garage a mile or more away), but you\\nget something that is thoroughly Italian and very well appointed too,\\nat most reasonable prices.\\n\\nThe Genoese suburban villas are a part of Genoa itself, in that they\\nwere built and inhabited by nobles of the city.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo the east of Genoa, at Albaro, is a collection of villas which comes\\nupon one as a great surprise.\\n\\nIn reality they are suburban palaces, with here and there more modest\\nvillas, and again mere modest dwellings. All are surrounded with hedges\\nof aloes, vines, olive and orange groves, and the effect is of the\\ncountry.\\n\\nIn the Villa del Paradiso Lord Byron was once a guest. Its loggia was a\\nfavourite lounging place, and the whole aspect of the villa and its\\ngrounds is as paradisal as one has any right to expect to find on earth.\\n\\nThe Villa Cambiaso was built in 1557 by Alessi from designs, it is\\ncommonly said, of the great Michael Angelo. The ancient Sardinian\\nPalazzo Imperiali is also here, and is popularly known as the Albero\\nd'Oro.\\n\\nA dozen miles to the east the gardens of the Villa de Franchi extend\\ndown, stair by stair, and fountain by fountain, to the Mediterranean\\nrocks. The villa is a typical terrace-house, long, and almost dwarfish\\non the front, where the \\\"piano nobile\\\" is also the ground floor; but on\\nthe side facing the sea it is a story higher, and of stately\\nproportions, and is flanked by widely extending wings. It is the typical\\nLigurian coast villa, one of a species which has set the copy for many\\nother seacoast villas and grounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE RIVIERA DI LEVANTE\\n\\n\\nThe gorgeous panorama of coast scenery continues east of Genoa as it has\\nobtained for some three hundred kilometres to the west. In fact the road\\nthrough Nervi and Recco is finer, if anything, and more hilly, though\\nless precipitous, than that portion immediately to the westward of\\nGenoa.\\n\\nBetween Genoa and Spezia the railway passes through fifty tunnels. The\\ntraveller by the high road has decidedly the best of it, but there are\\nalways those level crossings to take into consideration though fewer of\\nthem.\\n\\nNervi is a place of German hotels, much beer and an unaccommodating tram\\nline. The Grand Hotel gives access to the gardens of the villa of the\\nMarchese Gropollo, and this of itself is an attraction that Nervi's\\nother rather tawdry inns lack.\\n\\nRecco is an attractive and populous town, but has no monuments of note.\\n\\nThe highroad here climbs up the mountain of Portofino where the\\npromontory joins the mainland, and drops down the other side to Rapallo,\\nSanta Margherita, Cervara and Portofino. High up on the mountain cape is\\nthe Monastery of San Fruttoso, a picturesque and solitary conventual\\nestablishment in whose chapel are many tombs of the Dorias, all with\\ngood Gothic sculptures. In the convent of Cervara, en route to the\\nvillage of Portofino on the east side of the cape, Fran\\u00e7ois I, just\\nafter he lost \\\"all save honour\\\" at the battle of Pavia, was imprisoned\\nprevious to his voyage to Spain in the galleys which were to carry him a\\ncaptive to the domain of Charles Quint.\\n\\nThe roads along here are quite the best of the whole extent of the\\neastern and western Italian Rivieras. They are encumbered with a new\\nclass of traffic not met with further west. Up over the mountain of\\nPortofino winds the road in genuine mountain fashion though beautifully\\ngraded and kept. At almost any turning one is likely to meet a great\\nlumbering char-a-banc crowded with tourists, with five, six or eight\\nhorses caparisoned like a circus pageant, with bells around their necks,\\npheasants' feathers bobbing in their top-knots, and a lusty Ligurian on\\nthe hindermost seat blowing a coaching horn for all he is worth. This\\nis the Italian and German pleasure seeker's way of amusing himself. He\\nlikes it, the rest of us don't!\\n\\nSanta Margherita is now a full-blown resort with great hotels,\\nbathing-machines and all the usual attributes of a place of its class.\\nLace-making and coral-fishing are the occupations of the inhabitants who\\ndo not live off of exploiting the tourists. Both products are made here\\n(and in Belgium and Birmingham) in the imitation varieties, so one had\\nbest beware.\\n\\nIf one doesn't speak Italian, German will answer in all these resorts of\\nthe Levantine Riviera, quite as well as French or English. The\\n\\\"Tea-Shop\\\" and \\\"American Bar\\\" signs here give way to those of \\\"Munich\\\"\\nand \\\"Pilsner.\\\"\\n\\nThe village of Portofino itself is delightful; a quaint little fishing\\nport surrounded by tree-clad hills running to the water's edge. There is\\na H\\u00f4tel Splendide, once a villa of the accepted Ligurian order, and a\\nless pretentious, more characteristic, Albergo Delfino lower down on the\\nquay. The arms of the little port are a spouting dolphin as befits its\\nseafaring aspect, so the Albergo Delfino certainly ought to have the\\npreference for this reason if no other.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn the cliff road running around the promontory from Portofino to\\nRapallo are a half a dozen more or less modern villas of questionable\\narchitecture, but of imposing proportions, and one and all delightfully\\ndisposed.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Villa Pagana is the property of the Marchese Spinola, and the Castel\\nParaggi, the property of a gentleman prosaically named Brown, is\\ntheatrically and delightfully disposed, though bizarre in form.\\n\\nRapallo, at the head of the bay, is a continuation of what has gone\\nbefore. There are great hotels and pensions, and many of them. Its\\ncampaniles and church towers set off the framing of Rapallo\\ndelightfully. The H\\u00f4tel de l'Europe has more than once been the abode\\nof Queen Margherita of Italy, and most of the notables who pass this\\nway. The hotel curiously enough seems none the worse for it; it is good,\\nreasonable in price and conveniently situated on the quay, overlooking a\\npicturesque granite tower built up from a foundation sunk in the waters\\nof the Mediterranean. The Corsair Dragutte, a buccaneer of romantic\\ndays, came along and plundered these Ligurian towns as often as he felt\\nlike it. Frequently they paid no attention to his visits, save to give\\nup what blackmail and tribute he demanded; but Rapallo built this tower\\nas a sort of watch tower or fortress. It is an admirable example of a\\nsentinel watch tower, and might well be classed as a diminutive\\nfortress-ch\\u00e2teau.\\n\\nFrom Rapallo to Chiavari the coast road winds and rises and falls with\\nwonderful variety between villa gardens and vineyards. On the slopes\\nabove are dotted tiny dwellings, and church towers point skywards in\\nmost unexpected places.\\n\\nThe chief architectural attributes of Chiavari are its arcaded house\\nfronts, a queer blend of round and pointed arches, and columns of all\\norders. The effect is undeniably good. The town was one of the most\\nimportant in the old Genoese Republic, save the capital itself.\\n\\nThe towers scattered here and there through the town and in the\\nneighbourhood are all feudal relics, albeit they are fragmentary. The\\nCastle which the native points out with pride is neither very\\nmagnificent nor very elegant, but is indicative of the style of building\\nof the feudal time in these parts. Decidedly the best things of Chiavari\\nare its house fronts, and some crazy old streets running back from the\\nmain thoroughfares. There are some slate quarries in the neighbourhood\\nand a ten foot slab, larger than the top of a billiard table, can be cut\\nif occasion requires. The church of San Salvatore near Lavagna, where\\nthe quarries are, was founded by Pope Innocent IV in 1243.\\n\\nLavagna, near by, has a Palazzo Rosso, in that it is built of a reddish\\nstone, though that is not its official name. It was an appanage of the\\nFieschi family, who owned to Popes, Cardinals and soldiers in the\\ngallant days of the Genoese Republic. Sestri-Levante, a half a dozen\\nkilometres beyond Chiavari, is the last of the Riviera resorts. It is a\\nmere strip of villa and hotel-lined roadway with a delightful water\\nfront and a charming and idyllic background.\\n\\nSpezia is reached only by climbing a lengthy mountain road up over the\\nPass of the Bracco; sixty kilometres in all from Sestri to Spezia. The\\nhighroad now leaves the coast to wind around inland over the lower\\nslopes of the Apennines. The railway itself follows the shore.\\n\\nIt is a finely graded road with entrancing far-away vistas of the sea,\\nthe distant snow-capped summits of the mountains to the north and, off\\nsouthward, the more gently rising Tuscan hills.\\n\\nAfter having climbed some twenty-one hundred feet above the sea, the\\nhighroad runs down through the valley of the Vara, until finally at\\nSpezia, Italy's great marine arsenal, one comes again to the\\nMediterranean shore.\\n\\nJust before Spezia is reached, snuggled close in a little bay, is\\nVernazza -- where the wine comes from, at least, the wine the praises of\\nwhich were sung by Boccaccio \\\"as the paragon of wines.\\\" Wine is still a\\nproduct of the region, but its quality may not be what it once was.\\n\\nSpezia is a snug, conservative and exclusive military and naval town.\\nThe gold-lace and blue-cloth individuals of the \\\"service\\\" dominate\\neverything, even to the waiters in the hotels and caf\\u00e9s. No one else has\\na show.\\n\\nThe Hotel Croix de Malte (with a French name be it observed) is the\\nchic hotel of Spezia, with prices on a corresponding scale, and no\\ngarage. The Albergo Italia, equally well situated, a typical Italian\\nhouse of its class, is more modest in its prices and better as to its\\nfood. It has no garage either, but under the circumstances, that of\\nitself is no drawback. Across the street, in a vacant store, you may\\nlodge your automobile for two francs a night, or for one franc if you\\ntell the ambitious and obliging little man who runs it that he demands\\ntoo much. He is really the best thing we found in Spezia. We had run out\\nof gasoline in entering the city, the long run down hill flattened out\\ninto a plain just before the town was reached, but he accommodatingly\\nsent out a five gallon tin (\\\"original package\\\" goods from Philadelphia)\\nand would take no increase in price for his trouble. Such a thing in the\\nautomobile line ought to be encouraged. We pay \\\"through the nose,\\\" as\\nthe French say, often enough as it is.\\n\\nSpezia's suburban villas are a natural outcome of its environment, but\\nthey are all modern and have, none of them, the flavour of historic\\nromanticism about them.\\n\\nAn ancient castle tower on the hills above Spezia is about the only\\nfeudal ruin near by. The viper, the device of the Viscontis, is still\\ngraven above its entrance door to recall the fact that the device of the\\nMilanese nobles was a viper, and that their natures, too, took after\\nthat of the unlovely thing. The Viper of Milan and the Viscontis is a\\nworthy cage companion to the hedgehog of Fran\\u00e7ois I.\\n\\nSpezia's gulf is all that Spezia is not; romantic, lovely and varied. It\\nwas described in ancient times by Strabo, the geographer, and by\\nPersius. Little of its topographical surroundings or climatic attributes\\nhave changed since that day.\\n\\nThe road down the coast from Spezia is marked on the maps as perfectly\\nflat, but within a dozen kilometres, before Arcola is reached, is as\\nstiff a couple of hair-pin turns as one will remember ever having come\\nacross suddenly in his travels. They are not formidable hills, perhaps,\\nbut they are surprising, and since one has to drop down again\\nimmediately to sea level they seem entirely unnecessary.\\n\\nThe river Magra which enters the sea just east of Spezia divided the\\nGenoese territory from that of Tuscany.\\n\\n \\\"Macra che per cammin corto\\n Lo Gonovese parta dal Toscano.\\\"\\n -- Dante , \\\"Paradisio.\\\"\\n\\nSarzana is not a tourist point, but the traveller by road will not be in\\na hurry to pass it by. It has, curiously enough, an Albergo della Nuova\\nYork, built on the fortification walls of feudal days. It is not for\\nthis, though, that one lingers at Sarzana. The Bonapartes were\\noriginally descended from Sarzana ancestry. It was proven by\\ncontemporary documents that a certain Buonaparte, a notary, lived here\\nin 1264. Supposedly, it was this limb of the law who became the chief of\\nthe Corsican family.\\n\\nThe old feudal castle of Sarzana, with its round tower, its moat and its\\nlater Renaissance gateway is the very ideal of mouldy medi\\u00e6valism.\\n\\nFrom Sarzana, it is, figuratively speaking, but a step to Carrara and\\nMassa, the centres of the marble industry. Of all the materials the\\nartist requires, none is so much sought after as the pure white marble\\nof Carrara. The sculptured marble of Carrara goes out into the world\\nfrom thousands of ateliers to thousands of resting places but it all\\ncomes from this great white mountainside in the Apennines which has made\\nthe region famous and rich. This little Tuscan town of Carrara owes its\\nall to its, seemingly, inexhaustible stores of milk-white, fine-grained\\nmarbles. More especially is the marble of Carrara in demand for\\nstatuary; but in all the finer forms of carven stone it finds its place\\nsupreme.\\n\\nMen and beasts, oxen, horses and mules, and carts of all shapes and\\nsizes, make the vicinity of Carrara the centre of an uproar that would\\nbe maddening if one had to live in it; but it is all very interesting to\\nthe stranger, and speaks more loudly than words of the importance of the\\ngreat industry of the neighbourhood.\\n\\nAll around are great heaps -- mountains almost -- of broken, splintered\\nmarble; the d\\u00e9bris merely of the great blocks which have, in times past,\\nbeen quarried and sent to all quarters of the earth.\\n\\nThe quarries of Carrara have been worked ever since the Roman epoch, and\\nthe tufted hillsides round about have been burrowed to their bowels in\\ntaking out this untold wealth which, without exaggeration, has been as\\ngreat as that of many mines of gold.\\n\\nQuite twenty per cent. of the population work at the industry, and five\\nhundred men are actually engaged in hewing out and slicing off the great\\nblocks. Ten thousand, at least, find their livelihood dependent upon the\\nindustry, and two hundred thousand tons is a normal annual output; in\\nprice, valued at from 150 to 1,500 francs the cubic metre.\\n\\nAt Massa one joins the main road again running south by the shore. One\\nnever hears of the conventional tourist stopping at Massa; but we found\\nthe Hotel Massa and its dinner in the garden worth the taking and agreed\\nthat the Ch\\u00e2teau, in base rococo style, (now the public administrative\\nbuildings), a curiosity worth seeing. Massa has a Napoleonic memory\\nhanging over it, too, in that it was once the residence of the Little\\nCorporal's sister. Massa's Castello, high above all else in the town, is\\ngrim, lofty and spectacular though to be viewed only from without. Massa\\nis worth making a note of, even by the hurried traveller.\\n\\nSince leaving Sarzana the high road has become worse and worse, until in\\nthe vicinity of Carrara and Massa it is almost indescribably bad. There\\nis no such stretch of bad road in Europe as this awful fifty kilometres,\\nfor it continues all the way to Lucca and Livorno. The vast amount of\\ntraffic drawn by ten head of oxen at a time is what does it of course,\\nand as there is no way around one has to go through it, though it's a\\nheart-breaking job to one that cares anything for his automobile.\\n\\nPietrasanta, eight kilometres farther on, was, for us, an undiscovered\\nbeauty spot and historic shrine; at least, none of us had ever heard of\\nit till we passed the portals. Now we know that the walls, through which\\nwe passed, were the same that the blood-thirsty, battling Lorenzo di\\nMedici besieged in 1482; and that the ancient bronze font in the\\nBaptistery was the work of Donatello. We were glad that Massa and\\nPietrasanta were counted in, as they should be by everyone passing this\\nway, even though they did take up half a day's time -- all on account of\\nthe awful road -- part of which time, however, you are eating that\\nexcellent lunch in the garden of the Hotel Massa. That time will not be\\nlost anyway, one must eat somewhere.\\n\\nEight kilometres beyond Massa is Viareggio, an unlovely, incipient\\nseaside resort for dwellers in the Tuscan towns; but a historic spot\\nnevertheless, and interesting from that viewpoint at any rate.\\n\\nViareggio has no villas or palaces of note, and its chief associations\\nfor the traveller lie in its memories of Shelley and Ouida, the Marquise\\nde la Ram\\u00e9e. There is a monument, erected to Shelley in 1894,\\ncommemorating the fact that he was drowned here, in the Tyrrhenian Sea,\\nand his body consumed by fire, on the shore.\\n\\nIt was in the village of Massarosa, near Viareggio, that that\\nmuch-abused and very abusive old lady, Ouida, the Marquis de la Ram\\u00e9e,\\ndied in January, 1908. Since 1877 she had made Italy her home, and for\\nyears she had lived here alone, not in poverty or misery, for she had a\\n\\\"civil pension\\\" which was more than sufficient to keep the wolf from the\\ndoor. She died miserable and alone however. Ouida was a more real, more\\ncharitable person than she was given credit for being. She didn't like\\nthe English, and Americans she liked still less, but she loved the\\nItalians. Whose business was it then if she chose to live among them,\\nwith her unkempt and unwholesome-looking dogs and her slatternly\\nmaid-of-all-work? Ouida, as she herself said, did not hate humanity; she\\nhated society; and she had more courage than some of the rest of us in\\nthat she would have nothing to do with it.\\n\\nThe vineyards lying back of Viareggio may not be the most luxuriant in\\nItaly, but they blossom abundantly enough.\\n\\nLucca is thirty-five kilometres from Viareggio and the road still\\nbad -- on to Livorno, turning to the right instead of the left at\\nViareggio, it is worse.\\n\\nLucca has a right to its claim as one of the most ancient cities of\\nTuscany, for it is one of the least up-to-date of Italian cities. When\\nFlorence was still sunk in its marsh Lucca was already old, and filled\\nwith a commercial importance which to-day finds its echo in the\\ndistribution of the Lucca olive oil of trade which one may buy at\\nVancouver, Johannesburg or Rio. Indeed the label on the bottle of olive\\noil is the only reminiscence many have of Lucca.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe decadence came to Lucca in due time and it degenerated sadly, about\\nits last magnificent ray being that shot out when Napoleon gave the\\ncity to his sister Eliza Bacciochi, with the title of Princess of Lucca.\\nShe was a real benefactress to the country, but with the fall of\\nNapoleon all his satellites were snuffed out, too, and then the benign\\ninfluences of the Princess Eliza were forgotten and ignored.\\n\\nSouthwest from Lucca, with Pisa lying between, is the great port of\\nLeghorn, whence are shipped the marbles of Carrara, the oil of Lucca,\\nthe wines of Chianti and the Leghorn hats and braids of all Tuscany.\\nThese four things keep Livorno going.\\n\\nLeghorn is as modern as Lucca is antiquated and is the most cosmopolitan\\nof all Italian cities.\\n\\nWhen Philip III expelled the Moors from Spain Cosmo II, Duke of Livorno,\\ninvited two thousand of them to come to his Dukedom.\\n\\nMontesquieu remarked upon this conglomerate population, and approved of\\nit apparently, as he called the founding and populating of the city the\\nmaster work of the Medici dynasty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nON TUSCAN ROADS\\n\\n\\nThe valley of the Arno, as the river flows through the heart of Tuscany\\nfrom its source high in the hills just south of Monte Falterona, is the\\nmost romantic region in all Italy. It is the borderland between the\\nsouth and the north, and, as it was a battle-ground between Guelph and\\nGhibellines, so too is it the common ground where the blood of the\\nnortherner and southerner mingles to-day.\\n\\nAs great rivers go, the Arno is neither grand nor magnificent, but,\\nthough its proportions are not great, its banks are lined with historic\\nand artistic ruins, from the old fortress at Marina di Pisa to Poppi,\\nthe ancient capital of the Casentino, perched so quaintly upon its\\nriver-washed rock.\\n\\nPisa, Leghorn and Lucca are a triumvirate of Tuscan towns which should\\nbe viewed and considered collectively. One should not be included in\\nan itinerary without the others, though indeed they have little in\\ncommon, save the memories of the past.\\n\\n[Illustration: ON A TUSCAN HIGHWAY\\n\\nBlanche McManus\\n\\n1908]\\n\\nPisa is another of these dead cities of Europe, like Bruges, Leyden, and\\nRothenburg. Once ardent and lively in every activity of life, its\\npopulation now has sunk into a state of lethargy. Industry and commerce,\\nand the men who should busy themselves therewith, are in the background,\\nhidden behind a barrier of bureaucracy. Pisa, a town of twenty-six\\nthousand inhabitants, has a tribunal of nine civil judges, a criminal\\ncourt presided over by sixty-three more, and a \\\"roll\\\" of more than half\\na hundred notaries. Then there is a service of Domains, of Registry and\\nof Public Debt; besides an array of functionaries in charge of\\nseminaries, orphan asylums, schools and colleges. All these belong to\\nthe state.\\n\\nPisa, sitting distant and proud on the banks of the Arno, enjoys a\\nsofter climate than most of the coast cities or interior towns of\\ncentral Italy. The Tyrrhenian Sea is but a gulf of the Mediterranean,\\nbut just where it bathes the shore about the mouth of the Arno, it has a\\nhigher temperature than most northern Mediterranean waters.\\n\\nPisa is more of a sanitarium than it is a gay watering place however.\\nThe city is, in fact, like its celebrated leaning tower, half tottering\\non the brink of its grave. Commerce and industry are far from active and\\nits streets are half deserted; many of them are literally grass-grown\\nand all the others are paved with great flat clean-swept flags, a\\ndelight for the automobilist, whose chief experience of pavements has\\nbeen in France and Belgium.\\n\\nThe entrance to Pisa by road from the north is one of the most pleasing\\nof that of any Italian city. For the last half dozen kilometres the road\\nsteadily improves until it becomes one of the best as it circles around\\nthat wonderful triumvirate of architectural splendours, the Duomo, the\\nBaptistery and the tottering Torre. The group is one of the scenic\\nsurprises of Italy, and the automobilist has decidedly the best\\nopportunity of experiencing the emotions it awakes, for he does not have\\nto come out from town (for the monuments are some ways from the centre)\\nto see it. It is the first impression that the traveller by road gets of\\nPisa and of its architectural wonders, as he draws suddenly upon it from\\nthe slough-like road through which he has literally ploughed his way for\\nmany kilometres. And it is an impression he will never forget.\\n\\nAll along the banks of the Arno, as it flows through Pisa, are dotted\\nhere and there palaces of Renaissance days. One is now a dependence of a\\nhotel; another has been appropriated by the post office; others are\\nturned into banks and offices; but there are still some as well ordered\\nand livable as in their best days.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Agostini on the Lung' Arno, its fa\\u00e7ade ornamented with terra\\ncotta medallions, is now a part of the Hotel Nettuno which, as well as\\nany other of Pisa's hotels, cares for the automobilist in a satisfactory\\nmanner. Its garage accommodations are abominably confined, and to get in\\nand out one takes a considerable risk of damaging his mud-guards,\\notherwise they are satisfactory, though one pays two francs a night for\\nthem, which one should not be obliged to do. Here is another point where\\nFrance is superior to Italy as an automobile touring ground.\\n\\nPisa and its palaces are a delight from every point of view, though\\nindeed none of the edifices are very grand, or even luxurious. They\\nstrike a middle course however, and are indicative of the solid comfort\\nand content in which their original owners must have lived at Pisa in\\nlatter Renaissance times.\\n\\nPisa's Campo Santo is the most famous example of graveyard design and\\nbuilding in all the world. It is calm and dignified, but stupendous and\\nstartling in its immensity.\\n\\nFrom Pisa to Florence by road, following the valley of the Arno, one\\npasses through the typical Tuscan countryside, although the hill-country\\nlies either to one side or the other. It is the accessible route\\nhowever, and the one usually claimed by the local garage and hotel\\nkeepers to be one of the best of Italian roads. It is and it isn't; it\\nall depends upon the time of the year, the fact that the road may\\nrecently have been repaired or not, and the state of the weather. We\\nwent over it in a rain which had been falling steadily for three days\\nand found it very bad, though unquestionably it would have been much\\nmore comfortable going in dry weather. It is the approved route between\\nthe two cities however, and unless one is going directly down the coast\\nto Rome, via Grosseto, Pisa is the best place from which to commence the\\ninland d\\u00e9tour.\\n\\nCascina, a dozen kilometres away, was the scene of a sanguinary defeat\\nof the Pisans by the Florentines on the feast of San Vittorio in 1364,\\nand each year the event is celebrated by the inhabitants. It seems\\nsingular that a people should seek to perpetuate the memory of a\\ndefeat, but perhaps the original inhabitants sympathized with Florence\\nrather than with Pisa.\\n\\nPontedera is a big country town at the juncture of the Era and the Arno.\\nIt has no monuments and no history worth remarking, but is indicative of\\nthe prosperity of the country round about. Pontedera has no hotel with\\ngarage accommodations, and if you get caught in a thunder storm, as we\\ndid, you will have to grin and bear it and plug along.\\n\\nSan Miniato de Tedeschi rises on its hill top a few kilometres farther\\non in an imposing manner. It is the most conspicuous thing in the\\nlandscape for a wide radius. Francesco Sforza was born here, and\\nFrederic II made it the seat of the Imperial vicarage. San Miniato is a\\nhill town of the very first rank, and like others of the same\\nclass -- Fiesole, Colle and Volterra -- (though its hill-top site may have\\nnothing to do with this) it had the privilege of conferring nobility on\\nplebeians. The Grand Duke of Tuscany in the nineteenth century\\naccordingly made \\\"an English gentleman of Hebrew extraction\\\" -- so history\\nreads -- the Marquis of San Miniato. At any rate it was probably as good a\\ntitle as is usually conferred on any one, and served its soi-disant\\nowner well enough for a crest for his note paper or automobile door.\\nOne wonders what the gentleman took for his motto. History does not say.\\n\\nEmpoli is a thriving town, engaged principally in killing fowls and\\nsending them to the Florence market, plaiting straw to be made into\\nhats, and covering chianti bottles with the same material.\\n\\nThe Ghibellines would have made Empoli their capital in 1260, after\\ntheir meeting or \\\"parliament\\\" here. It was proposed too, that Florence\\nshould be razed. One man only, Farinata degli Uberti, opposed it.\\n\\\"Never,\\\" said he, \\\"will I consent that our beloved city, which our\\nenemies have spared, shall be destroyed or insulted by our own hands.\\\"\\n\\nThe old palace in which the Ghibelline parliament met still stands on\\nthe Piazza del Mercato.\\n\\nNo automobilist who \\\"happens\\\" on Empoli will ever want to see it again,\\non account of the indignities which will be heaped on his automobile,\\nthough the Albergo Guippone, run by a mother and son in most competent,\\nbut astonishing, fashion, is the real thing. The food and cooking are\\nextraordinarily good, and the house itself new and cleanly. You eat at a\\nbig round table, with a great long-necked bottle of chianti swung on a\\nbalance in the centre. It must hold at least two gallons, and, without\\nthe well-sweep arrangement for pouring out its contents, you would go\\ndry. The wine served is as good as the rest of the fare offered. The\\nfault with Empoli's hotel is that there is no garage and the proprietors\\nrecommend no one as competent to house your automobile, saying you can\\ntake your choice of any one of a half a dozen renters of stallagio \\nnear by. They are all bad doubtless; but the one we tried, who permitted\\nus to put the automobile in an uncovered dirty hole with horses, donkeys\\nand pigs, took -- yes, took, that's the word -- two lire for the service! If\\nyou do go to Empoli keep away from this ignorant, unprogressive\\nindividual.\\n\\nNorth of Empoli, on the direct road from Lucca to Florence, are Pistoja\\nand Prato.\\n\\nPistoja is one of the daintiest of Tuscan cities, but not many of the\\nhabitu\\u00e9s of Florence know it, at least not as they know Pisa or Siena.\\n\\nIts past is closely intermingled with Florentine and Italian history,\\nand indeed has been most interesting. Practically it is a little\\nmountain city, though lying quite at the base of the Apennines, just\\nbefore they flatten out into the seashore plain. Its country people, in\\ntown for a market-day, are chiefly people of the hills, shepherds and\\nthe like, but their speech is Tuscan, the purest speech of Italy, the\\nnearest that is left us to the speech of Boccaccio's day.\\n\\nPistoja's old walls and ramparts are not the least of its crumbling\\nglories. They are a relic of the Medicis and the arms and crests of this\\nfamily are still seen carved over several of the entrance gates. One has\\nonly to glance upward as he drives his automobile noisily through some\\nmedi\\u00e6val gateway to have memories of the days when cavalcades of lords\\nand ladies passed over the same road on horseback or in state coaches.\\n\\nAll is primitive and unworldly at Pistoja, but there is no ruinous\\ndecay, though here and there a transformed or rebuilt palace has been\\nturned into some institution or even a workshop.\\n\\nPrato, a near neighbour of Pistoja on the road to Florence, is also a\\nfine relic of an old walled Tuscan town. Aside from this its specialty\\nis churches, which are numerous, curious and beautiful, but except for\\nthe opportunity for viewing them the lover of the romantic and\\npicturesque will not want to linger long within the city.\\n\\nBetween Empoli and Florence is seen at a distance the Villa Ambrogiana;\\na transformation by Ferdinand I of an old castle of the Ardinghelli;\\nits towers and pinnacles still well preserved, but the whole forming a\\nhybrid, uncouth structure.\\n\\nFurther on at Montelupo there is a castle, now in ruins, built and\\nfortified by the Florentines in 1203. It owes its name, Montelupo, to\\nthe adoption of the word lupo , wolf, by the Florentines when they\\nsought to destroy a neighbouring clan called the Capraja ( capra ,\\ngoat).\\n\\nSigna is reached after crossing the Arno for the first time. The city\\nwalls, towers and pinnacles, with their battlements and machicolations,\\nare still as they were when the Florentines caused them to be erected to\\nguard the high road leading to their city.\\n\\nSuburban sights, in the shape of modern villas, market gardens and what\\nnot, announce the approach to Florence, which is entered by a broad\\nstraight road, the Strada Pisana, running beneath the Porta S. Frediano.\\nInstinctively one asks for the Lung' Arno that he may get his bearings,\\nand then straightway makes for his hotel or pension.\\n\\n \\n\\nHotels for the automobilist in Florence are numerous. The Automobile\\nClub de France vouches for the Palace Hotel, where you pay two francs\\nand a half for garage, and for the Grand Hotel de la Ville with no\\ngarage. The writer prefers the Hotel Helvetia, or better yet the Hotel\\nPorta Rossa, a genuine Italian albergo , patronized only by such\\nstrangers as come upon it unawares. It is very good, reasonable in\\nprice, and you may put your automobile in the remissa , which houses\\nthe hotel omnibus, for a franc a night. It is convenient to have your\\nautomobile close at hand instead of at the F. I. A. T. garage a mile or\\nmore away, and the hotel itself is most central, directly to the rear of\\nthe Strozzi Palace.\\n\\n\\\"What sort of city is this Florence?\\\" asked Boniface VIII, amazed at the\\nsplendour of the Florentine procession sent to Rome to honour his\\njubilee. No one was found ready with an answer, but at last a Cardinal\\ntimidly remarked, \\\"Your Holiness, the City of Florence is a good city.\\\"\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" replied the Pope, \\\"she is far away the greatest of all\\ncities! She feeds, clothes and governs us all.... She and her people are\\nthe fifth element of the universe.\\\"\\n\\nOne comes to Florence for pictures and palaces, and, for as long or\\nshort a time as fancy suggests, the automobile and the chauffeur, if you\\nhave one, take a needed repose. Your automobile safely housed, your\\nchauffeur will most likely be found, when wanted, at the Reininghaus on\\nthe Piazza Vittorio-Emanuel drinking German beer and reading \\\"Puck\\\" or\\n\\\"Judge\\\" or \\\"Punch\\\" or \\\"Le Rire.\\\" This is a caf\\u00e9 with more foreign\\npapers, one thinks, than any other on earth.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDown through the heart of Tuscany, and through the Chianti district,\\nruns the highroad from Florence to Rome, via Siena. It is a delightful\\nitinerary, whether made by road or rail, and, whether one's motive is\\nthe admiration and contemplation of art or architecture, or the sampling\\nof the chianti, en route, the journey through the Tuscan Apennines will\\never remain as a most fragrant memory. It is a lovely country of\\nvineyards and wheatfields, intermingled, and, here and there, clumps of\\nmulberry trees, and always great yoked oxen and contadini working,\\nwalking or sleeping.\\n\\nThese, indeed, are the general characteristics of all the countryside of\\ncentral Italy, but here they are superlatively idyllic. The simple life\\nmust be very nearly at its best here, for the almost unalterable fare of\\nbread and cheese and wine, which the peasants, by the roadside, seem\\nalways to be munching and drinking, is not conducive to grossness of\\nthought or action.\\n\\nFrom Florence to Rome there are three principal roads favoured by\\nautomobilists: that via Siena and Grosseto, 332 kilometres; via Siena,\\nOrvieto and Viterbo, 325 kilometres; and via Arezzo, Perugia and Terni,\\n308 kilometres. They are all equally interesting, but the latter two are\\nhilly throughout and the former, in rainy weather, is apt to be bad as\\nto surface.\\n\\nThe towers of Tuscany might well be made the interesting subject of an\\nentire book. Some of them, existing to-day, date from the Etruscans,\\nmany centuries before Christ, and Dionysius wrote that the Etruscans\\nwere called Tyrrhene or Turreno because they inhabited towers, or strong\\nplaces -- Typeie .\\n\\nIn the twelfth century, local laws, throughout Tuscany, reduced all\\ntowers to a height of fifty braccia . Pisa, Siena and Florence in\\nthe past had several hundred towers, but Volterra and San Gimignano\\nin the Val d'Elsa are the only remarkable collections still grouped\\nafter the original manner. \\\"San Gimignano delle belle Torri\\\" is a\\nclassic phrase and has inspired many chapters in books and many magazine\\narticles.\\n\\n \\n\\nMassimo d'Azeglio, whose opinions most people who write books on Italy\\nexploit as their own, said, with reason, that San Gimignano was as\\nextraordinary a relic of the past as Pompeii. Of all the fifty odd\\ntowers of the city, none is more imposing than that of the Palazzo\\nPublico, rising up above the very apartment, where, in the thirteenth\\ncentury, Dante was received when he was sent from Florence to parley\\nwith the Guelphs of San Gimignano.\\n\\nSan Gimignano's Palazzo del Commune dates from 1298, but its tower was\\nan afterthought, built a century later. This tower of the Palazzo del\\nCommune is, perhaps, the best preserved of all the \\\"belle torri\\\" of the\\ncity.\\n\\n \\n\\nSan Gimignano and Volterra are much alike, though the latter's strong\\npoint lies more in its fortification walls. Volterra and its Etruscan\\nlore and pottery have ever been a source of pride among Italian\\nantiquarians. The Etruscans of old must have been passionately fond of\\npottery, for, so plentifully were the environs of Volterra strewn with\\nbroken pitchers, that one suspects that each square yard must have\\ncontained a well. Some one called the Etruscans lunatics, who were shut\\nup in Volterra and allowed to pursue their craze for pottery in peace;\\nbut they were harmless lunatics, who devoted themselves to the arts of\\npeace, rather than those of war. The alabaster bric-\\u00e0-brac trade and\\ntraffic still exists, and provides a livelihood for a large part of the\\npopulation of the city; but thousands of Tuscans, many of them from\\nVolterra, doubtless, have deserted their former arts for the pleasure\\nof dragging a hand organ from street to street, in London and New York,\\nand gathering soldi by ministering to the pleasures of the populace. It\\nis easy for the superior person to sneer at the hand organ, as he\\nsneers, by the way, at the phonograph and the pianola, but dull alleys\\nand mean streets are brightened by the music of the itinerant Italian.\\n\\n\\\"It is a vision of the moyen-age,\\\" wrote Paul Bourget when he first saw\\nVolterra's Etruscan walls. High up on its rocky plateau sits Volterra,\\nprotected by its walls and gorges and ravines, in almost impregnable\\nfashion.\\n\\nWith this incentive no automobilist north or southbound should omit San\\nGimignano or Volterra from his itinerary. They are but a few kilometres\\noff the main road, from Poggibonzi via Val d'Elsa between Siena and\\nFlorence.\\n\\nOn a height overlooking Volterra, just over the Romitorio, and almost\\nwithin sight of San Gimignano's towers, Campanello, the celebrated\\nbrigand, was captured, a quarter of a century ago. He had quartered\\nhimself upon an unsuspecting, though unwilling, peasant, as was the\\nfashion with brigands of the time, and, through a \\\"faux pas,\\\" offended a\\nyouth who was in love with one of his host's daughters. This was his\\nundoing. The youth informed the local authorities; and Campanello led\\naway himself by the blind passion of love, fell precipitately into the\\ntrap which the injured youth had helped to set.\\n\\nThus ended another brigand's tale, which in these days are growing fewer\\nand fewer. One has to go to Corsica or Sardinia to experience the\\nsensation of being held up, or to the Paris boulevards where apaches \\nstill reign, or to the east end of London.\\n\\nGoing south from Florence by this road the automobilist has simply to\\nask his way via the \\\"Strada per Siena;\\\" after Siena it is the \\\"Strada\\nper Roma;\\\" and so on from one great town to another. In finding one's\\nway out of town the plan is simple, easily remembered and efficient;\\nthere are no false and confusing directions such as one frequently gets\\nin France. You are either on the Via This or That which ultimately leads\\nto the Strada of the same name, or you are not. Start right and you\\ncan't miss the road in Italy.\\n\\nAmong all the secondary cities of Italy, none equals Siena in romantic\\nappeal. Its site is most picturesque, its climate is salubrious, and it\\nhas an entirely medi\\u00e6val stamp so far as the arrangement of its palaces\\nis concerned. Siena possesses something unique in church architecture,\\nas might be expected of a city which once contained sixty places of\\nworship, a special patois, and women of surpassing beauty. More than by\\nanything else, Siena is brought to mind by the recollection of that\\nSaint Catherine, who, according to Pope Pius II, made all who approached\\nher better for her presence.\\n\\nThe railway and its appurtenances, automobiles and their belongings, the\\nelectric light and the telegraph, are almost the only signs of modernity\\nin Siena to-day. The rest is of the middle ages, and the chief\\ncharacters who stand out to-day are not the political personages of our\\ntime; but Bianca Capello and Marie de Medici and Charles V, who of all\\nother aliens is best remembered of Siena, because of the Holbein\\nreproduction of his face and figure which he presented to its citizens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nFLORENTINE BACKGROUNDS\\n\\n\\nThe hills and valleys around Florence offer delightful promenades by\\nroad to the automobilist as well as to those who have not the means at\\nhand of going so far afield. A commercial enterprise is exploiting them\\nby means of a great char-a-banc , or \\\"sightseeing\\\" automobile, which\\ndetracts from the sentiments and emotions which might otherwise be\\nevoked, and at the same time annoys the driver of a private automobile,\\nfor the reason that this public conveyance often crowds him on a narrow\\nroad and prevents his passing. However, this is better than being\\nobstructed, as in former days, by a string of forty lazy cabs and their\\ndrivers.\\n\\nThe round to Fiesole, San Miniato, Vallombrosa, and on through the\\nCasentino of romantic memory is delightful and may be made in a day or a\\nweek, as one's fancy dictates.\\n\\nThe new road from Florence to Fiesole, that is the road made in the\\nmid-nineteenth century, was not a piece of jobbery or graft, but was\\npaid for by patents of nobility given by the municipality of Fiesole to\\nthose who furnished the means. This was in the days when a Grand Duke\\nruled Tuscany and monarchical institutions found favour.\\n\\nFiesole had its Libro d'Oro, and inscribed thereon as noble any\\nindividual who would pay the required price. From fifteen hundred lire\\nupward was the price for which marquises, counts and barons were created\\nin Florence's patrician suburb.\\n\\nComing out from Florence by another gateway, through the Porta San\\nGallo, runs the Fiesole highway. A landmark, which can be readily\\npointed out by anyone, is the villa once possessed by Walter Savage\\nLandor and inhabited by him for nearly thirty years. Here the famous men\\nof letters of the middle years of the last century visited him. Here he\\nrevelled amid memories of Boccaccio and wrote the Pentameron. There is\\ntalk of buying the place and consecrating it to his memory.\\n\\nAll the way from Florence to Fiesole the roads are lined with typical\\nFlorentine villas and country houses. The Villa at Poggio Cajano was\\nbuilt by Lorenzo the Magnificent, who employed Giuliano da San Gallo as\\nhis architect. In 1587 Francesco I died within its walls, and the\\nprofligate Bianca Capello, whose history had best stay buried, also died\\nhere on the following day. Their brother Ferdinand was responsible for\\ntheir taking off, as they had already prepared to put him out of the way\\nby the administration of a dose of poison. He stood over them, with\\ndagger drawn, and made them eat their own poisoned viands.\\n\\nThe Villa Petraja was a strong-hold of the Brunelleschi family which\\ndefended itself ably against the Pisans and the marauders of Sir John\\nHawkwood in 1364, when that rollicking rascal sold his services to the\\nenemies of Florence. The old tower of the castle, as it then was, still\\nremains, but the major portion of the present structure dates from quite\\nmodern times.\\n\\nThe Villa Medici in Careggi was built by Cosimo Pater from the designs\\nof Michelozzi, and though no longer royal it is to-day practically\\nunchanged in general outline. It, too, was one of the favourite\\nresidences of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and the conclaves of the famous\\nPlatonic Academy were held here on the seventh of November, the\\nanniversary of the date of the birth and death of Plato. Here died both\\nCosimo and Lorenzo, the latter on the eighth of April, 1492, just after\\nhis celebrated interview with Savonarola. The Orsi family came into\\npossession of the villa later on, then \\\"an English gentleman\\\" and then a\\ncertain Signor Segr\\u00e9.\\n\\nBetween Careggi and Fiesole, and on towards Vallombrosa, the villas and\\npalatial country houses of the Florentines are scattered as thickly as\\nthe leaves of the famous vale itself.\\n\\nThe Villa Salviati is a fine sixteenth century work with a blood-red\\nmemory of the middle ages, at one time the property of the singer Mario,\\nremembered by a former generation. The Villa Rinuccini has its grounds\\nlaid out in the style of an English formal garden, and the Villa\\nGuadagni was once the home of the historian, Bartolommeo della Scala.\\n\\nOf all the Florentine suburban villas none has a tithe of the popular\\nromantic interest possessed by the Villa Palmieri. The Villa Palmieri is\\nbest seen from its approach by the highroad, up hill, from Florence. At\\nthe right of the iron gate, the cancello , runs the old road to\\nFiesole. Upward still the road runs, through the cancello , through a\\nwind-break of trees and around to the north fa\\u00e7ade by which one enters.\\nThe entire south side of the house is in the form of a loggia, with a\\ngreat wide terrace in front, below which is the sloping garden with its\\npalm trees and azaleas.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Villa Palmieri and its gardens are somewhat the worse for stress of\\ntime; and the wind and the hot sun have burned up the shrubs and trees\\nsince the days when Zocchi the draughtsman made that series of formal\\ndrawings of Italian gardens, that of the Villa Palmieri among the\\nnumber, which are so useful to the compilers of books on Italian villas\\nand gardens.\\n\\nFiesole sits proudly on its height a thousand feet above the level of\\nthe sea. The following anonymous lines -- \\\"newspaper verse\\\" they may be\\ncontemptuously described by some -- make as admirable a pen picture of\\nthe little town as it were possible to reproduce.\\n\\n \\\"A little town on a far off hill -- \\n (Fiesole, Fiesole!)\\n Mossy walls that defy Time's will,\\n Olive groves in the sun a-thrill\\n Thickets of roses where thrushes trill\\n Winds that quiver and then are still -- \\n Fiesole, Fiesole!\\\"\\n\\nFiesole forms an irregular ground plan, rising and falling on the\\nunequal ground upon which it is built. The long and almost unbroken line\\nof Cyclopean walls towards the north is the portion which has suffered\\nleast from time or violence. The huge stones of which the Etruscan wall\\nis composed are somewhat irregular in shape and unequal in size, seldom\\nassuming a polygonal form. This Cyclopean construction varies with the\\ngeological nature of the rock employed. In all the Etruscan and Pelasgic\\ntowns it is found that, when sandstone was used, the form of the stones\\nhas been that of the parallelopipedon or nearly so, as at Fiesole and\\nCortona; whereas, when limestone was the subjacent rock, the polygonal\\nconstruction alone is found, as at Cosa and Segni. This same observation\\nwill be found to apply to every part of the world, and in a marked\\ndegree to the Cyclopean constructions of Greece and Asia Minor, and\\neven to the far-distant edifices raised by the Peruvian Incas. Sometimes\\nthe pieces of rock are dovetailed into each other; others stand joint\\nabove joint; but, however placed, the face, or outward front, is\\nperfectly smooth. No projection, or work advancing beyond the line of\\nthe wall, appears in the remains of the original structure.\\n\\n \\n\\nFiesole is a built-up fabric in all its parts; its foundation is\\narchitecture, and its churches, palaces and villas are mere\\nprotuberances extending out from a concrete whole. Fiesole is one of the\\nmost remarkably built towns above ground.\\n\\nFiesole's great charm lies in its surrounding and ingredient elements;\\nin the palaces and villas of the hilltops always in plain view, and in\\nits massive construction of walls, rather than in its specific\\nmonuments, though indeed its Duomo possesses a crudity and rudeness of\\nconstructive and decorative elements which marks it as a distinct, if\\nbarbarous, Romanesque style.\\n\\nThe views from Fiesole's height are peculiarly fine. On the north is the\\nvalley of the Mugello, and just below is the Villa of Scipione Ammirato,\\nthe Florentine historian. Towards the south, the view commands the\\ncentral Val d'Arno, from its eastern extremity to the gorge of the\\nGonfolina, by which it communicates with the Val d'Arno di Sotto, with\\nFlorence as the main object in the rich landscape below.\\n\\nThe following is a medi\\u00e6val point of view as conceived by a Renaissance\\nhistorian. He wrote it of Lorenzo the Magnificent, but the emotions it\\ndescribes may as well become the possession of plebeian travellers of\\nto-day.\\n\\n\\\"Lorenzo ever retained a predilection for his country house just below\\nFiesole, and the terrace still remains which was his favourite walk.\\nPleasant gardens and walks bordered by cypresses add to the beauty of\\nthe spot, from which a splendid view of Florence encircled by its\\namphitheatre of mountains is obtained.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In a villa overhanging the towers of Florence, on the steep slopes of\\nthat lofty hill crowned by the mother city, the ancient Fiesole, in\\ngardens which Tully might have envied, with Ficino, Landino, and\\nPolitian at his side, he delighted his hours of leisure with the\\nbeautiful visions of Platonic philosophy, for which the summer stillness\\nof an Italian sky appears the most congenial accompaniment.\\\"\\n\\nThis is the twentieth century, but those of mood and mind may experience\\nthe same as did Lorenzo di Medici four hundred years ago. The hills and\\nvales, the Arno and the City of the Lily, with its domes and towers,\\nhave little changed during the many passing years.\\n\\nOut from Florence by the Porta alla Croce runs the road to Vallombrosa,\\nwhich may be reached also from Fiesole without entering Florence by\\ntaking the road leading over the Ponte a Mensola. Just beyond\\nPontassieve, some twenty kilometres distant, the road to Vallombrosa\\nleaves the Arezzo highway and plunges boldly into the heart of the\\nApennines.\\n\\nOf Vallombrosa Lamartine said: \\\"Abbey monumental, the Grande Chartreuse\\nof Italy built on the summit of the Apennines behind a rocky rampart,\\nprotected by precipices at every turn, by torrents of rushing water and\\nby dark, dank forests of fir-pines.\\\" The description is good to-day,\\nand, while the ways of access are many, including even a funiculaire \\nfrom Pontassieve to Vallombrosa, to approach the sainted pile in the\\ntrue and reverend spirit of the pilgrim one should make his way by the\\nwinding mountain road -- even if he has to walk. Indeed, walking is the\\nway to do it; the horses hereabouts are more inert than vigorous; they\\nmislead one; they start out bravely, but, if they don't fall by the\\nwayside, they come home limping. But for the fact that the road uphill\\nto Vallombrosa is none too good as to surface and the turns are many and\\nsharp, it is accessible enough by automobile.\\n\\nVarious granges, hermitages and convent walls are passed en route. At\\nSant'Ellero was a Benedictine nunnery belonging to the monks of\\nVallombrosa in the thirteenth century, and in its donjon tower -- a queer\\nadjunct for a nunnery by the way -- a band of fleeing Ghibellines were\\nbesieged by a horde of Guelphs in 1267.\\n\\nDomini and Saltino mark various stages in the ascent from the valley. Up\\nto this latter point indeed one may come by the funiculaire , but that\\nis not the true pilgrim way.\\n\\nUp to within a couple of kilometres of the summit chestnuts, oaks, and\\nbeech are seen, justifying Milton's simile, the accuracy of which has\\nbeen called in question on the ground that the forest consisted entirely\\nof fir.\\n\\n \\\"Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks\\n In Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades,\\n High overarch'd, embower.\\\"\\n\\nFour miles beyond Paterno, after passing through a fine forest of pines,\\nthe traveller arrives at the Santuario of Vallombrosa:\\n\\n \\\"Cosi fu nominata una badia,\\n Ricca e bella ne men religiosa\\n E cortese a chiunque vi venia.\\\"\\n -- Orl. Fur. can. 22, st. 36. \\n\\nAmong the remarkable men who have been monks of Vallombrosa, was Guido\\nAretino, who was a member of this house when he first became known as a\\nwriter upon music (about A. D. 1020). After having visited Rome twice,\\nupon the invitation of two succeeding popes, he was prevailed upon by\\nthe abbot of a monastery at Ferrara to settle there. Some writers have\\nascribed to this Guido the invention of counterpoint, which is scarcely\\nless absurd than ascribing the invention of a language to any\\nindividual. However, it is pretty certain that he was the first person\\nto use, or to recommend the use of \\\"lines\\\" and \\\"spaces\\\" for musical\\nnotation.\\n\\nHigh above the convent of Vallombrosa itself rises Il Paradisino (1,036\\nmetres) with a small hermitage, while Monte Secchieta is higher still,\\n1,447 metres. Vallombrosa, its convent and its hermitages are in the\\nmidst of solitude, as indeed a retreat, pious or otherwise, should be.\\nIf only some of us who are more worldly than a monk would go into a\\nretreat occasionally and commune with solitude awhile, what a\\nclarifying of ideas one would experience!\\n\\nBack of Vallombrosa and the Paradisino the upper valley of the Arno\\ncircles around through Arezzo, Bibbiena and Poppi and rises just under\\nthe brow of Monte Falterona which, in its very uppermost reaches, forms\\na part of the Casentino.\\n\\nFrom Pontassieve where one branches off for Vallombrosa one may descend\\non Arezzo either by Poppi-Bibbiena or Montevarchi, say seventy\\nkilometres either way.\\n\\nThe Casentino and the Valley of the Arno form one of the most\\nromantically unspoiled tracts in Italy, although modern civilization is\\ncrowding in on all sides. The memories of Saint Francis, La Verna, Saint\\nRomuald the Camaldoli and Dante and the great array of Renaissance\\nsplendours of its towns and villages, will live for ever.\\n\\nHere took place some of the severest conflicts in the civil wars of the\\nGuelphs and Ghibellines, and in numerous ruins of castles and hill-forts\\nare retained memorials of the many struggles.\\n\\nJust where the Arno traverses the plain of Campaldino was the scene of a\\ncelebrated battle on the 11th of June, 1289. The Aretines, who formed\\nthe chief portion of the Ghibelline party, were routed with a loss of\\n1,700 men killed, and 2,000 taken prisoners. Among the former was the\\ncelebrated Guglielmino Ubertini, Bishop of Arezzo, who fell fighting\\ndesperately in the thickest of the fray, having rallied his troops upon\\nthe bridge at Poppi, half a mile further on. Dante was present at this\\nbattle, being then twenty-four years old, and serving in the Guelph\\ncavalry.\\n\\nThe Casentino is the most opulent district in all the region of the\\nApennines. Six centuries ago the Counts Palatine of Tuscany held it;\\nthen came the Popes, and then Dante and his followers. The chronicles of\\nthe Casentino are most fascinating reading, particularly those concerned\\nwith the Counts of Guidi.\\n\\nGuidoguerra IV, Count Palatine of Tuscany in the early thirteenth\\ncentury, was a sort of Robin Hood, except that he was not an outlaw. He\\nmade a road near the home of the monks of Camaldoli, and intruded armed\\nmen into their solitude, \\\"and worse still, play actors and women,\\\" where\\nall women had been forbidden: moreover, he had all the oxen of the monks\\ndriven off. He played pranks on the minstrels and buffoons who came to\\nhis palace. One minstrel, named Malanotte, he compelled to spend a bad\\nnight on the rooftop in the snow; another, Maldecorpo, had to lie and\\nsizzle between two fires; while a third, Abbas, he tonsured by pulling\\nout his hair.\\n\\nLiterally translated Casentino means \\\"the valley enclosed.\\\" It is a most\\nromantic region, and the praises of its mountain walls and chestnut\\nwoods have been sung by all sojourners there, ever since Dante set the\\nfashion.\\n\\nThe life of the peasant of the Casentino to-day is much the same as in\\nDante's time, and his pleasures and sorrows are expressed in much the\\nsame manner as of old. Strange folksongs and dances, strange dramas of\\ncourtship, and strange religious ceremonies all find place here in this\\nunspoiled little forest tract between Florence and Arezzo; along whose\\nsilent paths one may wander for hours and come across no one but a few\\ncontented charcoal-burners who know nothing beyond their own woods.\\n\\nOn the lower levels, the highway leading from Florence to Perugia and\\nFoligno rolls along, as silent as it was in medi\\u00e6val times. It is by no\\nmeans a dull monotonous road, though containing fewer historic places\\nthan the road by Siena or Viterbo. It is an alternative route from north\\nto south; and the most direct one into the heart of Umbria.\\n\\nOn arriving from Florence by the highroad one passes through the long\\nmain street of Montevarchi, threading his way carefully to avoid, if\\npossible, the dogs and ducks which run riot everywhere.\\n\\nA great fertile plain stretches out on each side of the Arno, the\\nrailway sounding the only modern note to be heard, save the honk! honk!\\n(the French say coin , coin , which is better) of an occasional\\npassing automobile.\\n\\nUp and down the hills ox teams plough furrows as straight as on the\\nlevel, and the general view is pastoral until one strikes the forests\\nneighbouring upon Arezzo, eighty kilometres from Florence.\\n\\nHere all is savage and primeval. Here was many a brigand's haunt in the\\nold days, but the Government has wiped out the roving banditti; and\\nto-day the greatest discomfort which would result from a hold-up would\\nbe a demand for a cigar, or a box of matches. At Palazzaccio, a mere\\nhamlet en route, was the hiding place of the once notorious brigand\\nSpadolino; a sort of stage hero, who affected to rob the rich for the\\nbenefit of the poor -- a kind of socialism which was never successful.\\nRobin Hood tried it, so did Macaire, Gaspard de Besse and Robert le\\nDiable and they all came to timely capture.\\n\\nSpadolino one day stopped a carriage near Palazzaccio, cut the throats\\nof its occupants and gave their gold to a poor miller, Giacomo by name,\\nwho wanted ninety francesconi to pay his rent. This was the last\\ncunning trick of Spadolino, for he was soon captured and hung at the\\nPorta Santa Croce at Florence, as a warning to his kind.\\n\\nNot every hurried traveller who flies by express train from Florence to\\nRome puts foot to earth and makes acquaintance with Arezzo. The\\nautomobilist does better, he stops here, for one reason or another, and\\nhe sees things and learns things hitherto unknown to him.\\n\\nArezzo should not be omitted from the itinerary of any pilgrim to Italy.\\nIt was one of the twelve cities of the Etruscan federation, and made\\npeace with Rome in 310 A. D. and for ever remained its ally.\\n\\nThe Flaminian Way, built by the Consul Flaminius in 187 B. C., between\\nAretium (Arezzo) and Bononia (Bologna), is still traceable in the\\nneighbourhood.\\n\\nPetrarch is Arezzo's deity, and his birthplace is to be found to-day on\\nthe Via del Orto. On the occasion of the great f\\u00eate given in 1904 in\\nhonour of the six hundredth anniversary of his birth, the municipality\\nmade this place a historic monument.\\n\\nVasari, who as a biographer has been very useful to makers of books on\\nart, was also born at Arezzo in 1512. His house is a landmark. Local\\nguides miscall it a palace, but in reality it is a very humble edifice;\\nnot at all palatial.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Pretoria at Arezzo has one of the most bizarre fa\\u00e7ades\\nextant, albeit its decorative and cypher panels add no great\\narchitectural beauty.\\n\\nArezzo's cathedral is about the saddest, ugliest religious edifice in\\nItaly. Within is the tomb of Pope Gregory X.\\n\\nPoppi and Bibbiena are the two chief towns of the upper valley. Each is\\nblissfully unaware of the world that has gone before, and has little in\\ncommon with the life of to-day, save such intimacy as is brought by the\\nrailroad train, as it screeches along in the valley between them half a\\ndozen times a day.\\n\\nPoppi sits on a high table rock, its feet washed by the flowing Arno.\\nThe town itself is dead or sleeping; but most of its houses are frankly\\nmodern, in that they are well kept and freshly painted or whitewashed.\\n\\nThe only old building in Poppi, not in ruins, is its castle, occupying\\nthe highest part of the rock; a place of some strength before the use of\\nheavy guns. It was built by Lapo in 1230, and bears a family\\nresemblance to the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence. The court-yard contains\\nsome curious architecture, and a staircase celebrated for the skill\\nshown in its construction. It resembles that in the Bargello at\\nFlorence, and leads to a chapel containing frescoes which, according to\\nVasari, are by Spinello Aretino.\\n\\nPoppi is a good point from which to explore the western slopes of\\nVallombrosa or Monte Secchieta. The landlord and the local guides will\\nlead one up through the celebrated groves at a fixed price \\\"tutto\\ncompreso,\\\" and, if you are liberal with your tip, will open a bottle of\\n\\\"vino santo\\\" for you. Could hospitality and fair dealing go further?\\n\\nBibbiena, the native town of Francesco Berni, and of the Cardinal\\nBibbiena, who was the patron of Raphael, has many of the characteristics\\nof Poppi, in point of site and surroundings. It is the point of\\ndeparture for the convent of La Verna, built by St. Francis of Assisi in\\n1215; situated high on a shoulder of rugged rock. The highest point of\\nthe mountain, on which it stands, is called La Penna, the \\\"rock\\\" or\\n\\\"divide\\\" between the valleys of the Arno and the Tiber. To the eastward\\nare seen Umbria and the mountains of Perugia; on the west, the valley of\\nthe Casentino and the chain of the Prato Magno; to the northward is the\\nsource of the Arno, and to the northeast, that of the Tiber.\\n\\nTo the east, just where the Casentino, by means of the cross road\\nconnecting with the Via \\u00c6milia, held its line of communication with the\\nAdriatic, is the Romagna, a district where feudal strife and warfare\\nwere rampant throughout the middle ages. From its story it would seem as\\nthough the region never had a tranquil moment.\\n\\nThe chain of little towns of the Romagna is full of souvenirs of the\\ndays when seigneuries were carved out of pontifical lands by the sword\\nof some rebel who flaunted the temporal power of the church. These were\\nstrictly personal properties, and their owners owed territorial\\nallegiance to the Pope no more than they did to the descendants of the\\nEmperors.\\n\\nRex Romanorum as a doctrine was dead for ever. Guelph and Ghibelline\\nheld these little seigneuries, turn by turn, and from the Adriatic to\\nthe Gulf of Spezia there was almost constant warfare, sometimes petty,\\nsometimes great. It was warfare, too, between families, between people\\nof the same race, the most bloody, disastrous and sad of all warfare.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTHE ROAD TO ROME\\n\\n\\nSiena, crowning its precipitous hillside, stands, to-day, unchanged from\\nwhat it was in the days of the Triumvirate. Church tower and castle wall\\njut out into a vague mystery of silhouetted outline, whether viewed by\\ndaylight or moonlight. The great gates of the ramparts still guard the\\napproach on all sides, and the Porta Camollia of to-day is the same\\nthrough which the sons of Remus entered when fleeing from their scheming\\nUncle, Romulus.\\n\\nSiena's Piazza Vittorio Emanuele is a landmark. Dante called it \\\"a great\\nsquare where men live gloriously free,\\\" though then it was simply the \\nPiazza; and the picture is true to-day, in a different sense. In former\\ndays it was a bloody \\\"mis-en-sc\\u00e8ne\\\" for intrigue and jealousy; but,\\nto-day, simply the centre of the life and movement of a prosperous,\\nthriving, though less romantic city of thirty thousand souls.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis great Piazza is rounded off by a halo of magnificent feudal\\npalaces, whose very names are romantic.\\n\\nAll about Siena's squares and street corners are innumerable gurgling,\\nspouting fountains, many of them artistically and monumentally\\nbeautiful, and a few even dating from the glorious days of old.\\n\\nDante sang of Siena's famous fountains which, in truth, form a galaxy of\\nartistic accessories of life hardly to be equalled in any other city of\\nSiena's class. Leaving that \\\"noble extravagance in marble,\\\" Siena's\\nCathedral, and its churches quite apart, the city ranks as one of the\\nmost interesting tourist points of Italy.\\n\\nSiena has still left a relic of medi\\u00e6valism in the revival of its\\nancient horse racing festa, when its great Piazza Vittorio Emanuele is\\nbuilt up and barricaded like a circus of Roman times. Chariot races,\\ngladiatorial combats and bull fights, all had their partisans among\\nmunicipalities, but Siena's choice was horse racing. And each year, \\\"Il\\nPalio,\\\" on July the 2nd and on August the 16th, becomes a great popular\\namusement of the Sienese. It is most interesting, and still\\npicturesquely medi\\u00e6val in costuming and setting; and is a civic\\nfunction and f\\u00eate a great deal more artistically done -- as goes without\\nsaying -- than the Guy Fawkes celebrations of London, or the fourth of\\nJuly \\\"horribles\\\" in America. For the thoroughly genuine and artistic\\npageant Anglo Saxons have to go to Italy. There is nothing to be learned\\nfrom the Mardi-Gras celebrations of Paris nor the carnivals of the Cote\\nd'Azur.\\n\\nSome one has said that Siena sits on the border land between idyllic\\nTuscany and the great central Italian plain. Literally this is so. It\\nmarks the distinction between the grave and the gay so far as manners\\nand customs and conditions of life go. On the north are the charming,\\nsmiling hills and vales, bright with villas, groves and vines; whilst to\\nthe south, towards Rome and the Campagna, all is of an austerity of\\npresent day fact and past tradition. Indeed, the landscape would be\\nstern and repellent, were it not picturesquely savage.\\n\\nStraight runs the highroad to Rome via Viterbo, or makes a d\\u00e9tour via\\nMontepulciano and Orvieto. At Asinalunga, Garibaldi was arrested by\\ngovernment spies, by the order of the monarch to whom he had presented\\nthe sovereignty of Naples. Such is official ingratitude, ofttimes! The\\ntown itself is unworthy of remark, save for that incident of history.\\n\\nBy the direct road the mountains of Orvieto and Montepulciano rise\\ngrimly to the left. The towns bearing the same names are charming enough\\nfrom the artistic point of view, but are not usually reckoned tourist\\nsights.\\n\\nMontepulciano is commonly thought of slight interest, but it is the very\\nideal of an unspoiled medi\\u00e6val town, with a half dozen palazzo fa\\u00e7ades,\\nwhich might make the name and fame of some modern scene painter if he\\nwould copy them.\\n\\nChiusi, on the direct road, lies embedded in a circle of hills and\\nsurrounded by orange groves. It is nothing more nor less than a\\nglorified graveyard, but is unique in its class. Lars Porsena of Clusium\\ncomes down to us as a memory of school-time days, and for that reason,\\nif no other, we consider it our duty to visit the Etruscan tombs of\\nClusium, the modern Chiusi.\\n\\nThere are three distinct tiers, or shelves, of these ancient tombs, and\\ninteresting enough they are to all, but only the antiquary will have any\\nreal passion for them, so most of us are glad enough to spin our way by\\nroad another fifty odd kilometres to Orvieto.\\n\\nFour kilometres of a precipitous hill climb leads from the lower road up\\ninto Orvieto, zig-zagging all the way. It is the same bit of roadway up\\nwhich the Popes fled in the middle ages when hard pressed by their\\nenemies. Clement VII, one of the unhappy Medici, fled here after the\\nsinning Conn\\u00e9table Bourbon attempted the sacking of Rome; and a\\nsheltering stronghold he found it.\\n\\nThis Papal city of refuge is, to-day, a more or less squalid place, with\\nhere and there a note of something more splendid. On the whole Orvieto's\\ncharm is not so much in the grandeur of its monuments as in their\\ncharacter. The cathedral is reckoned one of the great Gothic shrines of\\nItaly, and that, indeed, is the chief reason for most of the tourist\\ntravel. The few medi\\u00e6val palaces that Orvieto possesses are very\\nsplendid, though they, one and all, suffer from their cramped\\nsurroundings.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Hotel Belle Arti, to-day, with a garage for automobiles, was the\\nancient Palazzo Bisenzi. It had a reputation among travellers, of a\\ndecade or a generation ago, of being a broken-down palace and a worse\\nhotel. If one wants to dwell in marble halls and sleep where royal heads\\nhave slept, one can do all this, at Orvieto, for eight or nine lire a\\nday.\\n\\nOne enters Viterbo, forty-seven kilometres from Orvieto, by the highroad\\nto Rome. The little town preserves much of its medi\\u00e6val\\ncharacteristics to-day, though, indeed, it is a progressive, busy place,\\nof something like twenty thousand souls, most of whom, appear to be\\nengaged in the wine industry. On the Piazza Fontana is a magnificent\\nGothic fountain dating from the thirteenth century, and the Municipio,\\non the Piazza del Plebiscito, is of a contemporary period, with a fine\\nfountained court-yard.\\n\\nIn the environs of Viterbo is a splendid palace, built by Vignola for\\nthe Cardinal Farnese, nephew of the Pope Paul III. In form it was a\\ngreat square mass with its angles reinforced by square towers, with a\\ncircular court within, surrounded by an arcade by which one entered the\\nvarious apartments. It was, perhaps, the most originally conceived work\\nof its particular epoch of Renaissance times; and all the master minds\\nand hands of the builders of the day seem to have had more or less to do\\nwith it. These Italians of the Renaissance were inventors of nothing;\\nbut their daring and ingenuity in combining ideas taken, bodily, from\\nthose of antiquity, made more successful and happy combinations than\\nthose of the architects of to-day, who build theatres after the models\\nof Venetian palaces, and add a Moorish minaret; or railway stations on\\nthe plan of the Parthenon, and put a campanile in the middle, like the\\nchimney of a blast furnace. The Italian campanile was a bell-tower, to\\nbe sure, but it had nothing in common with the minaret of the east, nor\\nthe church spire of the Gothic builder in northern climes.\\n\\nFrom Siena the coast road to Rome, practically the same distance as the\\ninland route, is one of surprising contrast. It approaches the coast at\\nGrosseto, seventy kilometres from Siena, and thence, all the way to\\nRome, skirts the lapping waves of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Off shore is Elba,\\nwith its Napoleonic memories, and the Island of Monte Cristo which is\\nconsidered usually a myth, but which exists in the real to-day, as it\\ndid when Dumas romanced (sic) about it. A long pull of a hundred\\nkilometres over a flat country, half land, half water, brings one to\\nCivita-Vecchia, eighty kilometres from the Eternal City itself.\\n\\nCivita-Vecchia is a watering-place without historical interest, where\\nthe Romans come to make a seaside holiday. Hotels of all ranks are here,\\nand garage accommodations as well. The Italian mail boats for Sardinia\\nleave daily, if one is inclined to make a side trip to that land of\\nbrigandage and the evil-eye, which are reputed a little worse than the\\nCorsican or Sicilian varieties.\\n\\nOne enters the heart of Rome by the Porta Cavalleggeri and crosses the\\nPonte S. Angelo to get his bearings.\\n\\nThe hotels of Rome are like those of Florence. One must hunt his abiding\\nplace out for himself, according to his likes and dislikes. The\\nGrand-Hotel and the Hotel de la Minerve are vouched for by the Touring\\nClub, and the former has garage accommodation. At either of these modern\\nestablishments you get the fare of Paris, Vienna, London and New York,\\nand very little that is Italian. You may even bathe in porcelain tubs\\ninstalled by a London plumber and drink cocktails mixed by an expert\\nfrom Broadway.\\n\\nThis makes one long for the days when a former generation ate in a\\nfamous eating house which stood at the southeast corner of the Square\\nSaint Eustace. It was the resort of artists and men of letters and the\\n plats that it served were famous the world over.\\n\\nThe Romans' pride in Rome is as conventional as it is ancient. They\\npromptly took sides when the \\\"Italians\\\" entered their beloved city in\\n1870. The priests, the higher prelates, and the papal nobility were \\\"for\\nthe Pope,\\\" but the great middle class, the common people, were for the\\n\\\"Italians.\\\" Traditions die hard in Rome, and many an old resident will\\ntell tales to-day of the blessings of a Papal Government, which formerly\\nforbade the discussion of religion or politics in public places, and\\n\\\"contaminating\\\" books and newspapers were stopped at the frontier .\\nEven a non-smoker was considered a protestor against the Papacy, because\\nto smoke was to be a supporter of the Papal Government's revenue from\\nthe tobacco trade.\\n\\n[Illustration: BARBERINI COLONNA ORSINI BORGIA MEDICIS\\n\\nARMS OF VARIOUS PAPAL FAMILIES\\n\\nCONTI PAMFILI ALDOBRANDINI FARNESE]\\n\\nRome without the forestieri , or strangers, would lose considerable of\\nits present day prosperity. Rome exploits strangers; there is no doubt\\nabout that; that is almost its sole industry. As Henri Taine said:\\n\\\"Rome is nothing but a shop which sells bric-\\u00e0-brac.\\\" He might have\\nadded: \\\"with a branch establishment which furnishes food and lodging.\\\"\\n\\nThe Roman population, as Roman, is now entirely absorbed by \\\"the\\nItalian.\\\" No more are the contadini , the peasants of the Campagna, or\\nthe bearded mountaineers of the Sabine hills, different from their\\nbrothers of Tuscany or Lombardy; their physiognomies have become the\\nsame. The monks and seminarists and priests and prelates are still\\nthere, but only by sufferance, like ourselves. They are no more Romans\\nthan are we. Tourists in knickerbockers, awe-struck before the art\\ntreasures of the Vatican, and cassocked priests on pilgrimage are\\neverywhere in the city of the C\\u00e6sars and the Popes. The venerable Bede\\nwas half right only in his prophecy.\\n\\n \\\"While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;\\n When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;\\n And when Rome falls -- the world!\\\"\\n\\nRome is still there, and many of its monuments, fragmentary though they\\nbe.\\n\\nThe difference in the grade (ground level) of modern Rome, as compared\\nwith that of antiquity, a difference of from sixty to seventy feet, may\\nstill be expected to give up finds to the industrious pick and shovel\\nproperly and intelligently handled. The arch\\u00e6ological stratum is\\nestimated as nine miles square.\\n\\nRome is a much worked-over field, but the desecrations of the middle\\nages were hardly less disastrous to its \\\"antiquities\\\" than the new\\nmunicipality's transformations. Some day the seven hills will be\\nlevelled, and boulevards and public gardens laid out and trees planted\\nin the Forum; then where will be the Rome of the C\\u00e6sars? \\\"Rome, Unhappy\\nCity!\\\" some one has said, and truly; not for its past, but for its\\npresent. Whatever the fascination of Rome may be it is not born of first\\nimpressions; the new quarters are painfully new and the streets are\\nunpicturesque and the Tiber is dirty, muddy and ill-smelling. Byron in\\nhis day thought differently, for he sang: \\\"the most living crystal that\\nwas e'er.\\\" Should he come back again he would sing another song. These\\nelements find their proper places in the city's ensemble after a time,\\nbut at first they are a disappointment.\\n\\n \\n\\nNext to Saint Peter's, the Vatican and the Colosseum, the Castle of\\nSant'Angelo is Rome's most popular monument. It has been a fortress for\\na thousand years. For a thousand years a guard has been posted at its\\ngateway.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe ruin of men which has passed within its walls is too lengthy a\\nchronicle to recount here. Lorenzo Colonna, of all others, shed his\\nblood most nobly. Because he would not say \\\"Long live the Orsini,\\\" he\\nwas led to the block, a new block ready made for this special purpose,\\nand having delivered himself in Latin of the words: \\\"Lord, into Thy\\nhands I commend my spirit,\\\" gave up his life in the last quarter of the\\nfifteenth century, \\\"on the last day of June when the people of Rome were\\ncelebrating the festivity of the decapitation of Saint Paul the\\nApostle.\\\" This was four centuries and more ago, but the circling walls\\nand the dull, damp corridors of the Castel Sant'Angelo still echo the\\nterror and suffering which formerly went on within them. It is the very\\nepitome of the character of the structure. Its architecture and its\\nhistory are in grim accord.\\n\\nWithin the great round tower of Sant'Angelo was imprisoned the unnatural\\nCatherine Sforza while the Borgias were besieging her city.\\n\\nThe Castel of Sant'Angelo and the bridge of the same name are so called\\nin honour of an Angel who descended before Saint Gregory the Great and\\nsaved Rome from a pest which threatened to decimate it.\\n\\nClose to the bridge of Sant'Angelo, just opposite Nona's Tower, once\\nstood the \\\"Lion Inn,\\\" kept by the lovely Vanozza de Catanei, the mother\\nof C\\u00e6sar, Gandia and Lucrezia Borgia. She was an inn-keeper of repute,\\naccording to history, and her career was most momentus. The automobilist\\nwonders if this inn were not a purveyor of good cheer as satisfactory as\\nthe great establishments with French, English and German names which\\ncater for tourists to-day.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Villa Medici just within the walls, and the Villa Borghese just\\nwithout, form a group which tourists usually do as a morning's\\nsight seeing. They do too much! Anyway one doesn't need to take his\\nautomobile from its garage for the excursion, so these classic villas\\nare only mentioned here.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo describe and illustrate the Villa Medici one must have the magic pen\\nof a Virgil and the palette of a Poussin and a Claude Lorrain. In\\nantiquity the site was known as the Collis Hortorum, the Hillside of\\nGardens. Lucullus, Prince of Voluptuousness, and Messaline, the Empress\\nof debauch, there celebrated their f\\u00eates of luxury and passion, and it\\nbecame in time even a picnic ground for holiday making Romans.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Villa Medici was originally built for Cardinal Ricci in 1540, but by\\nthe end of the century had come into the hands of Cardinal Alessandro di\\nMedici. The Tuscan Grand Dukes owned it a century or so later on, and it\\nwas finally sold to the French to house the academy of arts founded\\nat Rome by Louis XV.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is useless for a modern writer to attempt to describe the quiet charm\\nof the surroundings of the Villa Borghese, the nearest of the great\\ncountry houses to the centre of Rome. Many have tried to do so, but few\\nhave succeeded. Better far that one should point the way thither, make a\\npersonal observation or two and then onward to Tivoli, Albano or\\nFrascati.\\n\\nOne word on the Forum ere leaving. Not even the most restless\\nautomobilist neglects a stroll about the Forum, no matter how often he\\nmay have been here before, though its palaces of antiquity have little\\nmore than their outline foundations to tell their story to-day.\\n\\nCommendatore Boni, who has charge of the excavations, brought to light\\nrecently a curiously inscribed stone tablet, which, owing to the archaic\\nLatin it contained, he found it impossible to read. A number of learned\\nLatinists and arch\\u00e6ologists soon gathered about him. This is what they\\nread:\\n\\n QUE\\n STAELA VI\\n A\\n DEGLIA SINI\\n\\nWhile some declared that \\\" que \\\" was an enclitic conjunction, and that\\ntherefore the inscription must be incomplete, others asserted that the\\nword was an abbreviation of \\\" queo ,\\\" and that the inscription might be\\nread: \\\"I am able to gaze upon the star without pain.\\\"\\n\\nWhile the dispute was on, a peasant of the Campagna passed by. He\\napproached and asked the reason of the crowd. He was told, and gazing at\\nthe inscription for several minutes he read slowly:\\n\\n\\\"Questa e la via degli asini\\\" (\\\"This is the way of asses.\\\").\\n\\nAnd the Latinists, the arch\\u00e6ologists, and the other savants crept\\nquietly away, while the Commendatore in good, modern Tuscan made some\\nremarks unprintable and untranslatable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE CAMPAGNA AND BEYOND\\n\\n\\nThe environs of Rome -- those parts not given over to fox-hunting and\\nhorse-racing, importations which have been absorbed by the latter day\\nRoman from the forestieri -- still retain most of their characteristics\\nof historic times. The Campagna is still the Campagna; the Alban Hills\\nare still classic ground, and Tivoli and Frascati -- in spite of the\\nmodernisms which have, here and there, crept in -- are still the romantic\\nTivoli and Frascati of the ages long gone by.\\n\\nThe surrounding hills of Rome are, really, what give it its charm. The\\ncity is strong in contrast from every aspect, modernity nudging and\\ncrowding antiquity. Rome itself is not lovely, only superbly and\\nmajestically overpowering in its complexity.\\n\\nThe Rome of romantic times went as far afield as Otricoli, Ostia, Tivoli\\nand Albano, and, on the east, these outposts were further encircled by\\na girdle of villas, gardens and vineyards too numerous to plot on any\\nmap that was ever made.\\n\\nSuch is the charm of Rome; not its ruined temples, fountains and statues\\nalone; nor yet its great churches and palaces, and above all not the\\nview of the Colosseum lit up by coloured fires, but Rome the city and\\nthe Campagna.\\n\\nThere is no question that the Roman Campagna is a sad, dreary land\\nwithout a parallel in the well populated centres of Europe. Said\\nChateaubriand: \\\"It possesses a silence and solitude so vast that even\\nthe echoes of the tumults of the past enacted upon its soil are lost in\\nthe very expansiveness of the flat marshy plain.\\\"\\n\\nBalzac too wrote in the same vein: \\\"Imagine something of the desolation\\nof the country of Tyre and Babylon and you will have a picture of the\\nsadness and lonesomeness of this vast, wide, thinly populated region.\\\"\\n\\nThe similes of Balzac and of Chateaubriand hold good to-day. Long horned\\ncattle and crows are the chief living things -- and mosquitoes. One can't\\nforget the mosquitoes.\\n\\nHere and there a jagged stump of a pier of a Roman aqueduct pushes up\\nthrough the herb-grown soil, perhaps even an arch or two, or three or\\nfive; but hardly a tangible remembrance of the work of the hand of man\\nis left to-day, to indicate the myriads of comers and goers who once\\npassed over its famous Appian Way. The Appian Way is still there, loose\\nended fragments joined up here and there with a modern roadway which has\\nbecome its successor, and there is a very appreciable traffic, such as\\nit is, on the main lines of roadway north and south; but east and west\\nand round about, save for a few squalid huts and droves of cattle, sheep\\nand goats, a wayside inn, a fountain beneath a cypress and a few sleepy,\\ndusty hamlets and villages, there is nothing to indicate a progressive\\nmodern existence. All is as dead and dull as it was when Rome first\\ndecayed.\\n\\nOut from Rome, a couple of leagues on the Via Campagna, on the right\\nbank of the Tiber, one comes to the sad relic of La Magliana, the\\nhunting lodge of the Renaissance Popes. The evolution of the name of\\nthis country house comes from a corruption of the patronymic of the\\noriginal owners of the land, the family of Manlian, who were farmers in\\n390 B. C.\\n\\nThe road out from Rome, by the crumbling Circus Maxentius, the lone\\nfragments of Aqueduct, and the moss-grown tomb of Cecilia Metellag,\\nruns for a dozen kilometres at a dead level, to rise in the next dozen\\nor so to a height of four hundred and sixty odd metres just beyond\\nAlbano, when it descends and then rises again to Velletri ultimately to\\nflatten out and continue along practically at sea-level all the way to\\nCassino, a hundred and ninety kilometres from Rome. The classification\\ngiven to this road by the Touring Club Italiano is \\\"mediocre e\\npolveroso,\\\" and one need not be a deep student of the language to evolve\\nits meaning.\\n\\nA little farther away, but still within sight of the Eternal City, just\\nbefore coming to Albano, is Castel Gandolfo, a Papal stronghold since\\nthe middle ages. Urban VIII built a Papal palace here, and the\\nseigniorial ch\\u00e2teau, since transformed into a convent, was a sort of\\nsummer habitation of the Popes. The status of the little city of two\\nthousand souls is peculiar. It enjoys extra-territorial rights which\\nwere granted to the papal powers by the new order of things which came\\ninto being in 1871. A zone of loveliness surrounds the site which\\noverlooks, on one side, the dazzling little Albano Lake and, on the\\nother, stretches off across the Campagna to the shores of the\\nMediterranean.\\n\\nJust beyond Castel Gandolfo is Albano, still showing vestiges of the\\ncity of Domitian, which, in turn, was built upon the ruins of that of\\nPompey. Albano's fortifications rank as the most perfect examples of\\ntheir class in all Italy. They tell a story of many epochs; they are all\\nmassive, and are largely built in rough polygonal masonry. Towers,\\nturrets and temples are all here at Albano. Still the town is not ranked\\nas one of the tourist sights.\\n\\nThe Albano Lake is another one of those mysterious bodies of water\\nwithout source or outlet. It occupies the crater of an extinct volcano,\\nso some day it may disappear as quickly as it came. Concerning its\\norigin the following local legend is here related: \\\"Where the lake now\\nlies there stood once a great city. Here, when Jesus Christ came to\\nItaly, he begged alms. None took compassion on Him but an old woman who\\ngave Him some meal. He then bade her leave the city: she obeyed; the\\ncity instantly sank and the lake rose in its place.\\\"\\n\\nThis legend is probably founded on some vague recollection or tradition\\nof the fall of the city of Veii, which was so flourishing a state at the\\ntime of the foundation of Rome, and possessed so many attractions, that\\nit became a question whether Rome itself should not be abandoned for\\nVeii. The lake of Albano is intimately connected with the siege of Veii\\nand no place has more vivid memories of ancient Roman history.\\n\\nHere, overlooking the lake, once rose Alba Longa, the mother city of\\nRome, built by Ascanius, the son of \\u00c6neas, who named it after the white\\nsow which gave birth to the prodigious number of thirty young.\\n\\nOn the shore of the lake, opposite Albano, is Rocca di Papa. The convent\\nof the Passionist Fathers at Rocca di Papa, (the city itself being the\\none-time residence of the Anti-pope John) was built by Cardinal York,\\nthe last of the Stuarts, of materials taken from an ancient temple on\\nthe shores of Lake Albano.\\n\\nRocca di Papa is a most picturesque little hilltop village. Its\\nsugar-loaf cone is crowned with an old castle of the Colonnas which\\nremained their possession until 1487, when the Orsini in their turn took\\npossession.\\n\\nFrascati, on the Via Tusculum, about opposite Castel Gandolfo, as this\\nhistoric roadway parallels that of Claudius Appius, was Rome's patrician\\nsuburb, and to-day is the resort of nine-tenths of the excursionists out\\nfrom Rome for a day or an afternoon.\\n\\nFrascati, the villa suburb, and Tivoli alike depend upon their sylvan\\ncharms to set off the beauties of their palaces and villas. It was ever\\nthe custom among the princely Italian families -- the Farnese, the\\nBorghese, and the Medici -- to lavish their wealth on the laying out of\\nthe grounds quite as much as on the building of their palaces.\\n\\nFrascati's villas and palaces cannot be catalogued here. One and all are\\nthe outgrowth of an ancient Roman pleasure house of the ninth century,\\nand followed after as a natural course of events, the chief attraction\\nof the place being the wild-wood site ( frasche ), really a country\\nfaubourg of Rome itself.\\n\\nThe Popes and Cardinals favoured the spot for their country houses, and\\nthe nobles followed in their train. The chief of Frascati's\\narchitectural glories are the Villa Conti, its fountains and its\\ngardens; the Villa Aldobrandini of the Cardinal of that name, the nephew\\nof Pope Clement VIII; and the Villa Tusculana, or Villa Ruffinella, of\\nthe sixteenth century, but afterwards the property of Lucien Bonaparte\\nand the scene of one of Washington Irving's little known sketches, \\\"The\\nAdventure of an Artist.\\\" The Villa Falconieri at Frascati, built by the\\nCardinal Ruffini in the sixteenth century, formerly belonged to a long\\nline of Counts and Cardinals, but the hand of the German, which is\\ngrasping everything in sight, in all quarters of the globe, that other\\npeople by lack of foresight do not seem to care for, has acquired it as\\na home for \\\"convalescent\\\" German artists. Perhaps the omnific German\\nEmperor seeks to rival the functions of the Villa Medici with his Villa\\nFalconieri. He calls it a hospital, but it has studios, lecture rooms\\nand what not. What it all means no one seems to know.\\n\\nMinor villas are found dotted all over Frascati's hills, with charming\\nvistas opening out here and there in surprising manner. Not all are\\nmagnificently grand, few are superlatively excellent according to the\\nhighest \\u00e6sthetic standards, but all are of the satisfying, gratifying\\nquality that the layman will ever accept as something better than his\\nown conceptions would lead up to. That is the chief pleasure of\\ncontemplation, after all.\\n\\nAbove Frascati itself lies Tusculum, founded, says tradition, by a son\\nof Ulysses, the birthplace of Cato and a one time residence of Cicero.\\nThis would seem enough fame for any small town hardly important enough\\nto have its name marked on the map, and certainly not noted down in many\\nof the itineraries for automobile tourists which cross Italy in every\\ndirection. More than this, Tusculum has the ruins of an ancient castle,\\none day belonging to a race of fire-eating, quarrelsome counts who\\nleagued themselves with any one who had a cause, just or unjust, for\\nwhich to fight. Fighting was their trade, but Frederic I in 1167 beat\\nthem at their own game and razed their castle and its town of allies\\nhuddled about its walls. That is why Tusculum has not become a tourist\\nresort to-day, but the ruin is still there and one can imagine a\\ndifferent destiny had fate, or a stronger hand, had full sway.\\n\\nFrom Albano, another cross road, via Velletri to Valmontone, leads in\\ntwenty odd kilometres to Palestrina, whence one may continue his way to\\nSubiaco and thence to Tivoli and enter Rome again via the Porta San\\nLorenzo, having made a round of perhaps a hundred and fifty kilometres\\nof as varied a stretch of Italian roadway as could possibly be found.\\nThe gamut of scenic and architectural joys runs all the way from those\\nof the sea level Campagna and its monumental remains to the verdure and\\nromance of the Alban and Sabine Hills and the splendours of the memories\\nof the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli.\\n\\nLying well back from the Alban hills is Palestrina, the greatest\\nstronghold of the Colonnas and where a branch of the family still\\nmaintains a country house. The cradle of this great family, which gave\\nso many popes to Rome, and an inspiration and a divinity to\\nMichelangelo, was a village near Palestrina. It had a Corinthian column\\nrising in its piazza and from it the Colonna took their family arms.\\nIt is found on all documents relating to their history; on tapestries,\\nfurniture and medals in many museums and in many wood carvings in old\\nRoman churches.\\n\\nPalestrina, too, has memories of Michelangelo. The treasures of\\nmasterpieces left by him are scattered all over Italy to keep fresh the\\nmemory of his name and fame.\\n\\nSubiaco should be made a stopping place on every automobilist's\\nitinerary out from Rome. Some wit has said that any one living in a\\nplace ending with o was bound to be unhappy. He had in mind one or two\\nsad romances of Subiaco, though for all that one can hardly see what the\\nletters of its name have got to do with it. Subiaco has for long been\\nthe haunt of artists and others in search of the picturesque, but not\\nthe general run of tourists.\\n\\n \\n\\nSubiaco is still primitive in most things, and this in spite of the fact\\nthat a railway has been built through it in recent years. In feudal\\ntimes the town could hardly have been more primitive than now, in\\nfact the only thing that ever woke it from lethargy was a little game of\\nwarfare, sometimes with disaster for the inhabitants and sometimes for\\nthe other side.\\n\\nThe castle of the ruling baron sat high upon the height. What is left of\\nit is there to-day, but its capture has been made easier with the march\\nof progress. Down from the castle walls slopes the town, its happy,\\nunprogressive people as somnolent as of yore.\\n\\nSubiaco is one of the most accessible and conveniently situated hill\\ntowns of Italy, if any would seek it out. Nero first exploited Subiaco\\nwhen he built a villa here, as he did in other likely spots round about.\\nNero built up and he burned down and he fiddled all the while. He was\\ndecidedly a capricious character. History or legend says that Nero's cup\\nof cheer was struck from his hand by lightning one day when he was\\ndrinking the wine of Subiaco here at his hillside villa. He escaped\\nmiraculously, but he got a good scare, though it is not recorded that he\\nsigned the pledge!\\n\\nSubiaco's humble inn, \\\"The Partridge,\\\" is typical of its class\\nthroughout Italy. It is in no sense a very comfortably installed\\nestablishment, but it is better, far better, than the same class of inn\\nin England and America, and above all its cooking is better. A fowl and\\na salad and a bottle of wine and some gorgonzola are just a little\\nbetter at \\\"La Pernice\\\" than the writer remembers to have eaten elsewhere\\nunder similar conditions.\\n\\nTourists now come by dozens by road and rail to Subiaco -- with a\\npreponderance of arrivals by road -- whereas a few years ago only a few\\nventuresome artists and other lovers of the open knew its charms. Some\\nday of course this charm will be gone, but it is still lingering on and,\\nif you do not put on too great a pretense, you will get the same good\\ncheer at five francs a day at \\\"The Partridge\\\" whether you arrive in a\\nMerc\\u00e9d\\u00e8s or come as the artist does, white umbrella and canvases slung\\nacross your back. The proprietor of \\\"La Pernice\\\" has not as yet\\nsuccumbed to exploiting his clients.\\n\\nFrom Subiaco back to Rome via Tivoli is seventy kilometres and all down\\nhill.\\n\\nOne can have no complete idea of Roman life without an acquaintance with\\nthe villas and palaces of Frascati and Tivoli. Tivoli was the summer\\nresort of the old Romans. Mecenate, Horace, Catullus and Hadrian built\\nvillas there and enjoyed it, though in a later day it was reviled thus:\\n\\n \\n\\n Tivoli di mal conforto -- O piove, o tira vento, o suona a morto!\\n\\nTivoli may be said to have received its boom under the Roman nobles of\\nthe Augustan age who came here and set the fashion of the place as a\\ncountry residence. Things prospered beyond expectations, it would seem,\\nland agents being modest in those days, and by the time of Hadrian\\nreached their luxurious climax.\\n\\nPope Pius II founded Tivoli's citadel on the site of an already ruined\\namphitheatre in 1460. The Villa d'Este at Tivoli, built by the Cardinal\\nIppolito d'Este in 1549, is usually considered the most typical suburban\\nvilla in Italy. The house itself is an enormous pile, on one side being\\nthree stories higher than on the other. It is a terrace house in every\\nsense of the word. Statuary, originally dug up from Hadrian's villa,\\nonce embellished the house and grounds to a greater extent than now, but\\nunder the r\\u00e9gime of late years many of these pieces have disappeared.\\nWhere? The palace itself is comparatively a modest, dignified though\\nextensive structure, the views from its higher terraces stretching out\\nfar over the distant campagna .\\n\\nHadrian's Villa, with its magnificent grounds, occupies an area of vast\\nextent. According to Spartian, Hadrian, in the second century B. C.,\\nbuilt this marvel of architecture and landscape gardening according to a\\nfond and luxurious fancy which would have been inconceivable by any\\nother who lived at his time. All its great extent of buildings have\\nsuffered the stress of time, and some even have entirely disappeared, as\\na considerable part of the later monuments of Tivoli were built up from\\ntheir stones. Many of its art treasures were removed to distant points,\\nmany found their ways into public and private museums, and many have\\neven been transported to foreign lands. The Italian government has now\\nstopped all this by purchasing the site and making of it a national\\nmonument.\\n\\n \\n\\nWith Hadrian's Villa is connected a sad remembrance. Piranesi, that\\naccomplished and erratic draughtsman whose etchings and drawings of\\nRoman monuments have delighted an admiring world, died as a result of\\noverwork in connection with a series of measured drawings he was making\\nof this great memorial of Rome's globe-trotting Emperor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nLA BELLA NAPOLI\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nSouth from Rome the highroad to Naples, and on down into Calabria, at\\nfirst follows the old Appian Way, built by Appius Claudius in 312 B. C.\\nIt is a historic highway if there ever was one, from its commencement at\\nRome's ancient Porta Capuana (now the Porta San Sebastiano) to Capua.\\nAs historic ground it has been excavated and the soil turned over many,\\nmany times until it would seem as though nothing would be left to\\ndiscover. Enough has been found and piled up by the roadside to make the\\nthoroughfare a continuous \\\"sight\\\" for many kilometres. Great churches,\\ntombs, vineyards, cypress-wind-breaks and the arches of the Claudian\\naqueducts line its length, and if the automobilist is so minded he can\\neasily put in a day doing the first twenty kilometres.\\n\\nVelletri, thirty-six kilometres from Rome, is the first town of\\nimportance after passing Albano, practically suburban Rome.\\n\\nCisterna di Roma, a dozen kilometres further on, is a typical hill top\\ntown overlooking the Pontine Marshes below.\\n\\nTerracina, on the coast, sixty-two kilometres beyond Velletri, is the\\nborder town between the north and the south, practically the limit\\nbetween the extent of the Papal power and that of the kingdom of Naples.\\n\\nTerracina sits at sea-level, and in all probability it is none too\\nhealthy an abode, though ten thousand souls call it home and seem\\ncontent. It has a sea-view that would make the reputation of a resort,\\nand the French and Italian Touring Clubs recommend the Hotel Royal,\\nwhile the local druggist sells gasoline and oil to automobile tourists\\nat fair rates -- for Italy.\\n\\nAt Formia one may turn off the direct road and in half a dozen\\nkilometres come to the coast again at Gaeta. The road from Formia runs\\nthrough a picture paradise, and an unspoilt one, considering it from the\\nartist's point of view. Little more shall be said, though indeed it is\\nnot as at Sorrento or Capri, but quite as good in its way, and the\\nAlbergo della Quercia, at Formia, is not as yet overrun with a client\\u00e8le\\nof any sort. This is an artists' sketching ground that is some day going\\nto be exploited by some one; perhaps by the artist who made the pictures\\nof this book. Who knows?\\n\\nOver another fragment of the Appian Way the highroad now continues\\ntowards Naples via Capua.\\n\\nAt Capua the road plunges immediately into a maze of narrow streets and\\none's only assurance of being able to find his exit from the town is by\\nemploying a gamin to sit on the running board and shout destra or\\n sinistra at each turning until the open country is again reached at\\nthe dividing of the roads leading to Caserta and Naples respectively.\\n\\nThe highroad from Capua into Naples covers thirty kilometres of as good,\\nor bad, roadway as is usually found on entering a great city where the\\nnumerous manifest industries serve to furnish a traffic movement which\\nis not conducive to the upkeep of good roads. It is a good road, though,\\nin parts, but the nearer you get to \\\"la bella Napoli\\\" the worse it\\nbecomes, as bad, almost, as the roads in and out of Marseilles or Genoa,\\nand they are about the worst that exist for automobilists to revile.\\n\\nBy either Averso or Caserta one enters Naples by the rift in the hills\\nlying back of the observatory, and finally by the tram-lined Strada\\nForvia, always descending, until practically at sea-level one finds a\\ngarage close beside the Hotel Royal et des \\u00c9trangers and lodges himself\\nin that excellent hostelry. This is one way of doing it; there are of\\ncourse others.\\n\\nThe man that first said \\\" Vedi Napoli e poi mori! \\\" didn't know what he\\nwas talking about. No one will want to die after seeing Naples. He will\\nwant to live the longer and come again, if not for Naples itself then\\nfor its surroundings, for Pompeii, Herculaneum, Sorrento, Capri, Amalfi,\\nVesuvius and Ischia. Naples itself will be a good place at which to\\nleave one's extra luggage and to use as a mail address.\\n\\nThe history of Naples is vast, and its present and historic past is\\nmost interesting, but for all that Naples without its environs would be\\nas naught.\\n\\nThe local proverb of old:\\n\\n \\\"When Salerno has its port\\n Naples will be mort (dead),\\\"\\n\\nhas no reason for being any more, for Naples' future as a Mediterranean\\nseaport is assured by the indefatigable German who has recently made it\\na port of call for a half a dozen lines of German steamers. Britain may\\nrule the waves, but the German is fast absorbing the profitable end of\\nthe carrying trade.\\n\\nNaples is a crowded, uncomfortable city, for within a circumference of\\nscarce sixteen kilometres is huddled a population of considerably more\\nthan half a million souls.\\n\\nNaples' chief charms are its site, and its magnificently scenic\\nbackground, not its monuments or its people.\\n\\n\\\"The lazzaroni,\\\" remarked Montesquieu of the Neapolitan \\\"won't-works,\\\"\\n\\\"pass their time in the middle of the street.\\\" This observation was made\\nmany, many years ago, but it is equally true to-day.\\n\\nNaples is not the only Italian city where one sees men live without\\napparent means of existence, but it is here most to be remarked. On the\\nquays and on the promenades you see men and women without work, and\\napparently without ambition to look for it save to exploit strangers. On\\nthe steps of the churches you see men and women without legs, arms or\\neyes, and infants sans chemises , and they, too, live by the same idle\\noccupation of asking for alms.\\n\\nEverywhere at Naples, before your hotel, crowded around your carriage or\\nautomobile, or paddling around in boats just over your steamer's side,\\nare hoards of beggars of all sorts and conditions of poverty and\\nprobity. The beggar population of Naples is doubtless of no greater\\nproportions than in Genoa, or even Rome, but it is more in evidence and\\nmore insistent. There are singing beggars, lame, halt and blind beggars,\\nwhining beggars, swimming beggars, diving beggars, flower-selling\\nbeggars and just plain beggars . Give to one and you will have to give\\nto all -- or stand the consequences, which may be serious or not according\\nto circumstances. Don't disburse sterilized charity, then, but keep\\nhard-hearted.\\n\\nNaples' chief sights for the tourists are its museum, its great domed\\ngalleries and their caf\\u00e9s and restaurants, its Castello dell'Ovo and the\\nCastel del Carmine.\\n\\nThe Castello dell'Ovo is out in the sea, at the end of a tiny bridge or\\nbreakwater, running from the Pizzofalcone, one of the slopes of the\\nbackground hills of Naples running down to sea-level.\\n\\nAs a fortress the Castello dell'Ovo is outranked to-day by the least\\nefficient in any land, but one of the Spanish Viceroys, in 1532, Don\\nPedro of Toledo, thought it a stronghold of prime importance, due\\nentirely to its oval shape, which it preserves unto to-day. It is\\nunique, in form at any rate.\\n\\nCharles VIII of France, on his memorable Italian journeyings -- when he\\ndiscovered (sic) the Renaissance architecture of Italy and brought it\\nback home with him -- dismantled the castle and left it in its now\\nbarrack-like condition, shorn of any great distinction save the oval\\nshape of its donjon. One is bound to remark this noble monument as it is\\nfrom its quay that one embarks on the cranky, little, wobbling steamboat\\nwhich bears one to Capri. Lucullus, who had some reputation as a good\\nliver, once had a villa here on the very quay which surrounds the\\nCastello.\\n\\nOpposite the Villa del Popolo (near the Porta del Carmine), the People's\\nPark as we should call it, is a vast, forbidding, unlovely structure.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt was built in 1484 by Ferdinand I, but during Masaniello's little\\ndisturbance it became a stronghold of the people. To-day it serves as a\\nbarracks -- and of course as a military prison; all nondescript buildings\\nin Italy may be safely classed as military prisons, though indeed the\\nItalian soldiery do not look an unruly lot.\\n\\nIt is well to recall here that Masaniello, who gave his name to an opera\\nas well as being a patriot of the most rabid, though revolutionary,\\ntype, failed of his ambition and died through sheer inability to keep\\nawake and sufficiently free from anxiety to carry out his plans.\\nMasaniello lost his head toward the end and got untrustworthy, but this\\nwas far from justifying either his murder or the infamous treatment of\\nhis body immediately after death by the very mob that the day before had\\nadored him. His headless trunk was dragged for several hours through the\\nmud, and was flung at nightfall, like the body of a mad dog, into the\\ncity ditch. Next day, through a revulsion of feeling, he was canonized!\\nHis corpse was picked out of the ditch, arrayed in royal robes, and\\nburied magnificently in the cathedral. His fisherman's dress was rent\\ninto shreds to be preserved by the crowd as relics; the door of his hut\\nwas pulled off its hinges by a mob of women, and cut into small pieces\\nto be carved into images and made into caskets; while the very ground he\\nhad walked on was collected in small phials and sold for its weight in\\ngold to be worn next the heart as an amulet.\\n\\nThe \\\"Villas\\\" of Naples are often mere maisons bourgeoises of modern\\ndate. Many of them might well be in Brixton so far as their\\narchitectural charms go.\\n\\nOver in the Posilippo quarter, a delightful situation indeed, are\\ninnumerable flat-topped, whitewashed villas, so-called, entirely\\nunlovely, all things considered. One of these, the Villa Rendel, was\\nonce inhabited by Garibaldi, as a tablet on its wall announces.\\n\\nGaribaldi and the part that he and his red shirt played are not yet\\nforgotten. Apropos of this there is a famous lawsuit still in the\\nItalian courts, wherein the Garibaldian Colonel Cornacci, in accord with\\nRicciotti Garibaldi, son of the general, makes the following claim\\nagainst the Italian government:\\n\\nI. All the \\\" tresor \\\" (gold and silver) of the house of Bourbon.\\n\\nII. Eleven millions of ducats taken from the Garibaldian government at\\nNaples.\\n\\nIII. The Bourbon museum now incorporated with the National Museum.\\n\\nIV. The Palace of Caserta and its park.\\n\\nV. The Palace Farnese at Rome.\\n\\nVI. The Palace and Villa Farnese at Caprarola at Naples.\\n\\nVII. Two Villas at Naples, Capodimonte and La Favorita.\\n\\nThis is the balance sheet discrepancy resulting from the war of 1860\\nwhich the Garibaldian heirs claim is theirs by rights. It's a mere\\nbagatelle of course! One wonders why the Italian government don't settle\\nit at once and be done with it!\\n\\nNaples is the birth-place of Polichinelle, as Paris is of Pierrot, two\\nfigures of fancy which will never die out in literature or art, a tender\\nexpression of sentiment quite worthy of being kept alive.\\n\\nThe Neapolitan, en f\\u00eate, is quite the equal in gayety and\\nirresponsibility of the inhabitant of Seville or Montmartre. The\\nprocessionings of any big Italian town are a thing which, once seen,\\nwill always be remembered. At Naples they seem a bit more gorgeous and\\nspontaneous in their gayety than elsewhere, with rugs and banners\\nfloating in the air from every balcony, and flowers falling from every\\nhand. It is every man's carnival, the celebration at Naples.\\n\\nLeading out to the west, back of Posilippo, is the Strada di\\nPiedigrotta, which is continued as the Grotto Nuovo di Posilipo, and\\nthrough which runs a tramway, all kinds of animal-drawn wheeled traffic,\\nand automobiles with open exhausts. All this comports little with the\\nfact that the ancient tunnelled road along here was one of the marvels\\nof engineering in the time of Augustus and that it led to Virgil's tomb.\\nThis supposed tomb of Virgil is questioned by arch\\u00e6ologists, but that\\ndoesn't much matter for the rest of us. We know that Virgil himself has\\nsaid that it was here that he composed the \\\"Georgics\\\" and the \\\"\\u00c6neid,\\\"\\nand it might well have been his last resting-place too.\\n\\n\\\"Addio, mia bella Napoli! Addio!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHE BEAUTIFUL BAY OF NAPLES\\n\\n\\n\\\"See Naples and die\\\" is all very well for a sentiment, but when we first\\nsaw it, many years ago, it was under a grim, grey sky, and its shore\\nfront was washed by a milky-green fury of a sea.\\n\\nFortunately it is not always thus; indeed it is seldom so. On that\\noccasion Vesuvius was invisible, and Posilippo in dim relief. What a\\ncontrast to things as they usually are! Still, Naples and its Bay are no\\nphenomenal wonders. Suppress the point of view, the focus of Virgil, of\\nHorace, of Tiberius and of Nero, and the view of \\\"Alger la Blanche,\\\" or\\nof Marseilles and its headlands, is quite as beautiful. And the Bay of\\nNaples is not so beautifully blue either; the Bai de la Ciotat in\\nMaritime Province is often the same colour, and has a nearby range of\\njutting, jagged, foam-lashed promontories that are all that Capri\\nis -- all but the grotto.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Bay of Naples has its moods, and there are times when its blueness\\nis more apparent than at others; in short there are times when it looks\\nmore beautiful than at others, and then one is apt to think its charms\\nsuperlative.\\n\\nThe praises of the ravishing beauty of the Bay of Naples have been sung\\nby the poets and told in prose ever since the art of writing travel\\nimpressions has been known, but though the half may not have been told\\nit were futile to reiterate what one may see for himself if he will only\\ncome and look. \\\"A piece of heaven fallen to earth,\\\" Sannazar has said,\\nand certainly no one can hope to describe it with more glowing praise.\\n\\nFor the artist the whole Neapolitan coastline, and background as well,\\nis a riot of rainbow colouring such as can hardly be found elsewhere\\nexcept in the Orient. It is not only that the Bay of Naples is blue, but\\nthe greys and drabs of the ash and cinders of Vesuvius seem to\\naccentuate all the brilliant reds and yellows and greens of the foliage\\nand housetops, not forgetting the shipping of the little ports and the\\ncostuming of land-lubbers and sailor-men, and of course the women. The\\nItalian women, young or old, are possessed of about the loveliest\\ncolouring of any of the fair women of the twentieth century portrait\\ngallery.\\n\\nThe environs of Naples have two plagues which, when they rise in their\\nwrath, can scarcely be avoided. One is the sirocco, that dry, stiff wind\\nwhich blows along the Mediterranean coast in summer, coming from the\\nAfrican shore and the desert beyond, and the much worse, or at least\\nmore dreaded, aria cattiva , which is supposed to blow the sulphurous\\ngases and cinders of Vesuvius down the population's throats, and does to\\na certain extent.\\n\\nOut beyond Posilippo, which itself is properly enough bound up with the\\nlife of Naples, lies Pouzzoles. The excursion is usually made in half a\\nday by carriage, and automobilists have been known to do it in half an\\nhour. The former method is preferable, though the automobilist is free\\nfrom the rapacious Neapolitan cab driver and that's a good deal in\\nfavour of the new locomotion. If only automobilists as a class wouldn't\\nbe in such a hurry!\\n\\nPouzzoles has no splendid palaces but it has the remains of a former\\ntemple of Augustus in the shape of twelve magnificent Corinthian\\ncolumns, built into the Cathedral of Saint Procule, and some remains of\\nanother shrine dedicated to Serapis. There are also the ruins of\\nCicero's villa at Baies, a little further on. Mont Gauro, where the\\n\\\"rough Falernian\\\" wine, whose praises were sung by Walter de Mapes,\\ncomes from, shelters the little village on one side and Mont Nuovo on\\nthe other, this last a mountain or hillock of perhaps a hundred and\\nfifty metres in height, which grew up in a night as a result of a\\nsixteenth century earthquake.\\n\\nThe Lake of Averno is nearby, a tiny body of water whose name and fame\\nare celebrated afar, but which as a lake, properly considered, hardly\\nranks in size with the average mill-pond. With a depth of some thirty\\nodd metres and a circumference of three kilometres its charms were\\nsufficient to attract Hannibal thither to sacrifice to Pluto, and Virgil\\nthere laid the \\\"Descent into Purgatory.\\\" Agrippa, with an indomitable\\nenergy and the help of twenty thousand slaves, made it into a port great\\nenough to shelter the Roman fleet. At Baies there is a magnificent\\nfeudal work in the form of a fortress-ch\\u00e2teau of Pedro of Toledo (1538).\\n\\nAt the tiny port of Torregaveta, just beyond, one takes ship for Procida\\nand Ischia, two islands often neglected in making the round of Naples\\nBay.\\n\\nProcida, off shore three or four kilometres, and with a length of about\\nthe same, has a population of fifteen thousand, most of whom rent boats\\nto visitors. Competition here being fierce, prices are reasonable -- anything\\nyou like to pay, provided you can clinch the bargain beforehand.\\n\\nIschia is twice the size of Procida, twice the distance from the\\nmainland and has twice the population of the latter. One might say, too,\\nthat it is twice as interesting. It is a vast pyramid of rock dominated\\nby a ch\\u00e2teau-fort dating from 1450. It looks almost unreal in its\\nimpressiveness, and since it is of volcanic growth the island may some\\nday disappear as suddenly as it came. Such is the fear of most of the\\npopulation.\\n\\nA quick round south from Naples can be made by following the itinerary\\nbelow. It can be done in a day or a week, but in the former case one\\nmust be content with a cinematographic reminiscence.\\n\\n Naples -- Portici 4.8 Kilometres\\n Resina -- Herculaneum 6.3 \\\"\\n Torre del Greco 9.4 \\\"\\n Torre Anunziata 16.6 \\\"\\n Castellamare 24.5 \\\"\\n Sorrento 42.9 \\\"\\n Meta -- Positano 59.8 \\\"\\n Amalfi 70.1 \\\"\\n Salerno 94.7 \\\"\\n Naples 144.6 \\\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSome one has said that Vesuvius was a vicious boil on the neck of\\nNaples. There is not much sentiment in the expression and little\\ndelicacy, but there is much truth in it. Still, if it were not for\\nVesuvius much of the charm and character of the Bay of Naples and its\\n cadre would be gone for ever.\\n\\nAll around the base of the great cone are a flock of little half-baked,\\nlava-burned villages, as sad as an Esquimaux settlement in the great\\nlone land. This is the way they strike one as places to live in, though\\nthe artist folk find them picturesque enough, it is true, and a poet of\\nthe Dante type would probably get as much inspiration here as did\\nAlighieri from the Inferno.\\n\\nIt has been remarked before now that Italy is a birdless land. The\\nRenaissance poets sang differently, but judging from the country\\nimmediately neighbouring upon Vesuvius, and Calabria to the southward,\\none is inclined to join forces with the first mentioned authority. Not\\neven a carrion crow could make a living in some parts of southern Italy.\\n\\nSo desolate and lone is this sparsely populated region towards the south\\nthat it is about the only part of Italy where one may hope to encounter\\nthe brigand of romance and fiction.\\n\\nThe thing is not unheard of to-day, but what brigands are left are\\npresumably kidnappers for political purposes who wreak their vengeance\\non some official. The stranger tourist goes free. He is only robbed by\\nthe hotel keepers and their employees who think more of buona mano \\nthan anything else. A recent account (1907), in an Italian journal,\\ntells of the adventures of the master of ceremonies at Victor Emmanuel's\\ncourt who was captured by bandits and imprisoned in a cave in that\\n terra incognita back of Vesuvius away from the coast.\\n\\nNewspaper accounts are often at variance with the facts, but these made\\nthrilling reading. One account said that the kidnappers tore out the\\nMarquis's teeth, one by one, in order to force him to write a letter\\nasking for ransom. As he still refused, lights were held to the soles of\\nhis naked feet.\\n\\nThe Marquis was lured from Naples to the neighbourhood of a grotto in\\nthe direction of Vesuvius, where he was seized by the brigand's\\nconfederates.\\n\\n\\\"I was seized unexpectedly from behind,\\\" said the Marquis in his\\nversion, \\\"and after a sharp struggle with my unseen assailants was\\ncarried down into the grotto with Herculanean force and tightly bound.\\n\\n\\\"Then, liberating my right arm, the brigands fetched a lamp and writing\\nmaterials, covering their faces with masks. Threatening me with instant\\ndeath, the chief forced me to write a letter to my friends demanding\\nthat money be sent me forthwith. At the same time he took from me all my\\nvaluables and then disappeared, leaving me a prisoner with a guard\\nbefore the entrance of my cave.\\\"\\n\\nThe adventure ended harmlessly enough, and whether it was all a dream or\\nnot of course nobody but the Marquis knows. At any rate it has quite a\\nmedi\\u00e6val ring to it.\\n\\n \\n\\nPompeii is remarkable, but it is disappointing. All that is of real\\ninterest has been removed to the Naples museum. Without its Forum and\\nits magnificent temples and Vesuvius as a toile de fond Pompeii would\\nbe a dreary place indeed to any but an arch\\u00e6ologist. It is a waste of\\ntime to view any restored historic monument where modern house painters\\nhave refurbished the old half-obliterated frescoes. The famous Cave\\nCanem, too, the only mosaic that remains intact, has been twice removed\\nfrom its original emplacement. Yes, Pompeii is a disappointment! It is\\ntoo much of a show-place!\\n\\nThe most notable observation to be made with regard to the admirable\\narchitectural details of Pompeii is that they are all on a diminutive\\nscale. The colonnade of the Forum, for instance, could never be carried\\nout on the magnificent scale of the Roman Forum, and indeed, when modern\\narchitects have attempted to reproduce the fa\\u00e7ade of a tiny pagan\\ntemple, as in the \\u00c9glise de la Madeleine, or the Palais Bourbon at\\nParis, they have failed miserably.\\n\\nThe rival claims of the Hotel Suisse and the Hotel Diomede at Pompeii\\n(to say nothing of that of the Albergo del Sol opposite the entrance to\\nthe Amphitheatre) make it difficult for the stranger to decide upon\\nwhich to bestow his patronage.\\n\\nThe artists go to the Albergo del Sol, which is rough and uncomfortable\\nenough from many points of view, and the tourists of convention go to\\none of the other two, where they are \\\"exploited\\\" a bit but get more\\nattention. At any one of these hotels one can hire a horse to climb up\\nthe cone of Vesuvius, if one thinks he would like such rude sport, and\\nprices are anything he will pay, about five or six francs, though it\\ncosts another two francs for a guide and another two francs for the\\nragamuffin who follows after and holds the horses while you explore the\\ncrater. If the latter was blacking boots in New York, even for a\\npadrone, at five cents a shine, he would make more money and be counted\\nout of the robber class. As it is he is a rank impostor and\\nneedless -- provided you have the courage to refuse his services.\\n\\nThe contrast between Herculaneum and Pompeii is notable. Herculaneum was\\nburied under thirty metres of liquid lava, but Pompeii was buried only\\nroof-high under cinders. Herculaneum will some day be uncovered to the\\nextent of Pompeii, and then it is probable the world will have new\\nmarvels at which to wonder.\\n\\nThe rewards from the excavation of Herculaneum may well be commensurate\\nwith the toil. It was an infinitely more important place than Pompeii,\\nwhich was only a little country town without libraries or particularly\\nwealthy inhabitants. Herculaneum, on the other hand, was the summer\\nresort of wealthy Romans, who spent their lives in adorning their\\nbeautiful villas with the choicest work of Greek art. Pliny said that\\nthey had a mania for collecting Greek silver and other works of art, and\\nat prices that would even make the wealthiest art connoisseurs of\\nto-day pause for thought. Agrippina, among others, had her villa here.\\nHerculaneum remains intact and undespoiled, as it was more than eighteen\\ncenturies ago.\\n\\n[Illustration: The Environs of Pompeii \\n\\nSTABIAE \\u00b7 SARNVS-FLV \\u00b7 SVRRENTVM \\u00b7 CAPRE\\u00c6 \\u00b7 PORTVS\\n\\nPOMPEIANA]\\n\\nFrom Pompeii to Sorrento via Castellamare is twenty-five kilometres.\\n\\nSorrento is, in summer, a bathing place for such of the Neapolitan\\nhigh-life population as are not able to get far away from home. One\\nproperly enough attaches no importance whatever to the gay life of the\\nboulevards, the caf\\u00e9s and the restaurants of Naples. It is the same\\nthing as at Rome, Paris and London over again with all its silly\\nflaneries, but here at Sorrento, or across the peninsula at Amalfi, life\\nis less feverish and one may stroll about or indeed live free and\\ntranquil from care in hotels, less luxurious no doubt than those of the\\nQuai Parthenope, but offering a sufficient degree of comfort to make\\nthem agreeable to the most exacting.\\n\\nThe real winter birds of passage only alight here for a period of three\\nor four weeks in January or February. After that it is delightful,\\nexcept for the short period when it is given up to the crowd of tourists\\nwhich invariably comes at Easter.\\n\\nSorrento is the great centre for all the charming region bordering upon\\nthe southern shore of the Bay of Naples. It is at once the city and the\\ncountry. Its hotels are delightfully disposed amid flowering gardens or\\non a terrace overlooking the escarpments of the rock-bound coast. Six or\\nseven francs a day, or eight or ten, according to the class of\\nestablishment one patronizes, and one finds the best of simple fare and\\ncomfort. Eight days or a fortnight one may roam about the neighbourhood\\nat Sorrento, from Sant Agatha on a nearby height to Sejano Castellamare,\\nPositano, Amalfi and finally Capri. There is hardly such a range of\\ncharming little towns and townlets to be found elsewhere in all the\\nworld.\\n\\nExcept for its restricted little business quarter the houses and villas\\nof Sorrento are disposed on the best of \\\"garden city\\\" plans. Again a\\nplague on a beauty spot must be admitted: mosquitoes will all but devour\\nyou here between mid-August and the end of October. The only safe-guard\\nis to paint yourself with iodine, but the cure is as bad as the\\ncomplaint.\\n\\nThe traveller in Italy learns of course to beware of coral, of white,\\npink and milky coloured coral. We had been afraid to even look at such\\never since we had seen it being made by the ton in Belgium -- and good\\nlooking \\\"coral\\\" it was.\\n\\nOnce the artist bought a string of the real thing at Tabarka in Tunisia,\\nand once a friend who was with us on the Riviera di Ponente bought a\\nnecklet of what was called coral, at an outrageous price, of a wily\\nboatman. It all went up in smoke (accompanied by a vile smell)\\nultimately, though fortunately it was not on the owner's neck at the\\ntime. It was an injudicious mixture of gun-cotton, nitroglycerine or\\nwhat not. It wasn't coral; that was evident.\\n\\nNow, when we walk out at Sorrento, no Graziella, her shoulders\\nscintillating with ropes of coral, beguiles us into buying any of her\\nfamily heirlooms. To sum up: the coral which is sold to tourists is\\noften false; that which is fished up before your eyes from the sea is\\nalways so. Beware of the coral of Sorrento or Capri.\\n\\nThe trip to Capri is of course included in every one's itinerary in\\nthese parts, and for that reason it is not omitted here, though indeed\\nthe famous grotto over which the sentimentally inclined so love to rave\\nhas little more charm than the same thing represented on the stage. This\\nat any rate is one man's opinion. It is most conveniently reached by\\nboat from Sorrento.\\n\\nThe famous retreat of Augustus and the scene of the debauches of\\nTiberius will ever have an attraction for the globe-trotter, even though\\nits romance is mostly fictitious. One may gather any opinions he\\nchooses, and, provided he gathers them on the spot and makes them up out\\nof his own imaginings, he will be content with Capri's grotto; only he\\nmustn't take the guide-books too seriously.\\n\\nThe Blue Grotto's goddess is Amphitrite, and if any one catches a\\nglimpse of her traditional scanty draperies swishing around a corner,\\nlet him not be misguided into following her into her retreat. If he does\\nthe sea is guaranteed to rise and close the orifice so that he may not\\nget out again as soon as he might wish.\\n\\nIn that case one must wait till the wind, which has veered suddenly from\\neast to west, comes about again and blows from the south. Without\\nbringing Amphitrite into the matter at all it sometimes happens that\\nvisitors entering the grotto for a pleasant half hour may be obliged to\\nstay there two, three or even five days. The boatmen-guides, providing\\nfor such emergencies, carry with them a certain quantity of biscotti \\nwith which to sustain their victims. As for fresh water it trickles\\nthrough into the grotto in several places in a sufficient quantity to\\nallay any apprehensions as to dying of thirst. One might well blame the\\nCapri guides for not calling the visitor's attention to these things.\\nBut if one is reproached he simply answers: \\\" Ma che ! eccelenza , if\\nwe should call attention to this thing, half the would-be visitors would\\nbalk at the first step, and that would be bad for our business.\\\"\\n\\nAlexandre Dumas tells of how on a visit to Capri in 1835 the fisherman\\nwas pointed out to him who had ten years earlier re-discovered the Blue\\nGrotto of Augustus' time, whilst searching for mussels among the rocks.\\nHe went at once to the authorities on the island and told them of his\\ndiscovery and asked for the privilege of exploiting visitors. This\\ndiscoverer of a new underground world was able by means of graft, or\\nother means, to put the thing through and lived in ease ever after,\\nthrough his ability to levy a toll on other guides to whom he farmed out\\nhis privilege.\\n\\nQuite the best of Capri is above ground, the isle itself, set like a gem\\nin the waters of the Mediterranean. The very natural symphonic colouring\\nof the rocks and hillsides and rooftops of its houses, and indeed the\\ncostuming of its very people, make it very beautiful.\\n\\nFor Amalfi, Salerno and P\\u00e6stum the automobilist must retrace his way\\nfrom Sorrento to Castellamare, when, in thirty kilometres, he may gain\\nAmalfi, and, in another twenty-five, Salerno. P\\u00e6stum and its temples, to\\nmany the chief things of interest in Italy, the land of noble monuments,\\nlie forty kilometres away from Salerno. The automobilist, to add this to\\nhis excursion out from Naples, is debarred from making the round in a\\nday, even if he would. It is worth doing however; that goes without\\nsaying, though the attempt is not made here of purveying guide-book or\\nhistorical information. If you don't know anything about P\\u00e6stum, or care\\nanything about it, then leave it out and get back to Naples as quickly\\nas you can, and so on out of the country at the same rate of speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nACROSS UMBRIA TO THE ADRIATIC\\n\\n\\nThe mountain district of Umbria, a country of clear outlines against\\npale blue skies, is one of the most charming in the peninsula though not\\nthe most grandly scenic.\\n\\nThe highway from Rome to Ancona, across Umbria, follows the itinerary of\\none of the most ancient of Roman roads, the Via Valeria. The railway,\\ntoo, follows almost in the same track, though each leaves the Imperial\\nCity, itself, by the great trunk line via Salaria and the Valley of the\\nTiber.\\n\\nTerni is the great junction from which radiate various other lines of\\ncommunication to all parts of the kingdom. Terni is, practically, the\\ngeographical centre of Italy. It is a bustling manufacturing town and,\\nsupposedly, the Interamna where Tacitus was born.\\n\\nFrom Terni one reaches Naples, via Avezzano in 257 kilometres; Rome, via\\nCivita Castellana in 94 kilometres; Florence via Perugia and Arezzo in\\n256 kilometres and Ancona, on the shores of the Adriatic, via Foligno in\\n209 kilometres. All of these roads run the gamut from high to low levels\\nand, though in no sense to be classed as mountain roads, are\\nsufficiently trying to even a modern automobile to be classed as\\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Cascades of Terni used to be one of the stock sights of tourists, a\\ngeneration ago, but, truth to tell, they are not remarkable natural\\nbeauties, and, indeed, are too apparently artificial to be admired.\\nMoreover one is too much \\\"exploited\\\" in the neighbourhood to enjoy his\\nvisit. It costs half a lira to enter by this gate, and to leave by that\\nroad; to cross this bridge, or descend into that cavern; and troops of\\nchildren beg soldi of you at every turn. The thing is not worth doing.\\n\\nSpoleto, twenty-six kilometres away, is somewhat more interesting. It is\\nfamous for the fine relics, which still exist, of its more magnificent\\ndays, when, 242 B. C., it was named Spoletium.\\n\\nThe towers of Spoleto, like those of San Gimignano and Volterra, are its\\nchief glory; civic, secular and churchly towers, all blending into one\\nhazy mass of grim, militant power. The Franciscan convent, on the\\nuppermost height, seems to guard all the towers below, as a shepherd\\nguards his flock, or a mother hen her chickens.\\n\\nIn 1499 the equivocal, enigmatic Lucrezia Borgia came to inhabit the\\ncastle of Spoleto. The fair but unholy Lucrezia was a wandering,\\nrestless being who liked apparently to be continually on the move.\\n\\nHere, in the fortress of Spoleto, Lucrezia Borgia, coming straight from\\nthe Vatican, held for a brief year the seals of the state in her frail\\nhands, her father at the time being governor.\\n\\nThe aspect of this grim fortress-ch\\u00e2teau, grim but livable, as one knows\\nfrom the historical accounts, is to-day, so far as outlines are\\nconcerned, just as it was five centuries ago. It is grandiose, severe\\nand majestic, and is dominant in all the landscape round about, not even\\nits mountain background dwarfing its proportions. The military defence\\nwas that portion lying lowest down in the valley, while the residence of\\nthe governor was in the upper portion. One reads the history of three\\ndistinct epochs in its architecture, the Gothic of the fifteenth\\ncentury, that of the sixteenth, and the later interpolated Renaissance\\ndecorations.\\n\\nThrough Foligno and Assisi runs the road to Perugia. Assisi is a much\\nvisited shrine, but Foligno is remembered by most of those who have\\ntravelled that way only as a grimy railway junction.\\n\\n \\n\\nAssisi, the little Umbrian hill town, is deservedly the popular shrine\\nthat it is. Assisi is a religious shrine, but its skyline silhouette is\\nmore like that which properly belongs to a warlike stronghold. The city\\nof St. Francis is loved by men of all creeds who recall the story of the\\nholy man who, with poverty as a garment, trod his long way, singing,\\ntalking to the birds and succouring all who were sore or heavy laden.\\n\\nImmense antiquity is suggested by everything round about, from the\\ntombs of the Etruscan Necropolis, dating from 150 B.C., down to the\\ntriple-storied convent church of San Francesco of 1230 and the Basilica\\nof Santa Maria degli Angeli of 1509.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe now secularized convent and its triple church have all the\\ncharacteristics of a medi\\u00e6val fortress when viewed from afar.\\n\\nThe town itself owes most, if not all, of its fame to its beloved San\\nFrancesco. His birthplace has disappeared and its site occupied by the\\nChiesa Nuova, but a part of it has been built into the church, making it\\nanother shrine of the holy man who did so much good to his fellows\\nduring his life, and to his native town in these late days by bringing\\ntens, nay, even hundreds, of thousands of tourists thither to spend\\ntheir money on local guides, cabmen and inn-keepers. A sordid point of\\nview some may think. But is it? What would Assisi be without the\\ntourists? Still wooing the Lady Poverty, there's no doubt about that.\\nWhat would Venice be without the tourists? Not what it is to-day. No\\nindeed. It is dead and dull enough even now at certain seasons. It would\\nbecome so for all time without the strangers.\\n\\nPerugia is the big town of Umbria. To-day it boasts of twenty odd\\nthousand souls, but in the days when it struggled against papal control\\nit was even more populous. Its history is one long drawn out tale of\\nrevolt and submission in turn, from the days when it first submitted to\\nthe Romans in 310 B. C. until it threw its fate in with that of the\\nother states of Victor Emmanuel in 1860.\\n\\nIf ever a city was blood-baptized that honour is Perugia's. It has not a\\ncrooked old street nor gate nor fountain nor piazza or palazzo but what\\nis gory with bloody memories.\\n\\nPerugia was a dominant medi\\u00e6val influence all through the neighbourhood\\nand levied tribute on all her vassal cities and towns. Foligno's walls\\nand ramparts had fallen and the people of Perugia came and carted off\\nthe stone for their own needs; Arezzo stripped her churches and\\npalaces to provide the marbles for Perugia's cathedral.\\n\\n \\n\\nPerugia's oxen are famous in literature and art, but they have almost\\nbecome a memory, though an occasional one may be seen standing in the\\nmarket place or a yoke working in the nearby fields. Electric cars haul\\npassengers and freight about the city at a death-dealing pace, and the\\nox as a beast of burden is out-distanced and out-classed.\\n\\nThe ancient civilization is represented at Perugia by a remarkable\\nseries of old fortification walls, still admirably conserved, a\\nkilometre or more from the centre of town, a necropolis of ten chambers,\\nand an antique Roman arch of Augustus.\\n\\nPerugia's lode star for travellers has ever been the fact that it was\\nthe centre of the school of Umbrian painters. This is not saying that it\\nhas no architecture worth mentioning, for the reverse is the case.\\n\\nOut from Perugia by the Porta di Elce, on the Cortona road, one passes a\\ncouple of imposing edifices. One, from a distance, looks grandly\\nromantic and medi\\u00e6val, but is only a base modern reproduction in cement\\nand timber -- and for all the writer knows, steel beams as well -- of an\\nancient feudal castle. The other is less grand, less luxurious possibly,\\nbut is the very ideal of an Italian country house, habitable to-day, but\\nsurrounded with all the romantic flavour of medi\\u00e6valism. It is still\\ncalled the Villa of the Cardinal by virtue of the fact that Cardinal\\nFulvio della Corgna built it in 1580. Locally, it is also known as the\\nVilla Umberto, and it belongs to, and is inhabited by, the family of\\nCommendatore Ferdinando Cesaroni. Architecturally, perhaps, the villa is\\nnot a great work, but it is marvellously satisfying to the eye by reason\\nof its disposition and its outlook.\\n\\nGubbio, thirty-nine kilometres away by road, is not readily accessible\\nby rail from Perugia, though on the direct line from Arezzo, Ancona and\\nFoligno.\\n\\nThe automobilist may reach Gubbio from Perugia in less time than the\\nrail-tied traveller may check his baggage and take his place in the\\ntrain.\\n\\nNot many include Gubbio in their Italian tours. Its Etruscan lore and\\nrelics have been made the subject of volumes, but little has been done\\nto set forth its charms for the Italian pilgrim who would seek to get\\naway from the herding crowds of the great cities and towns.\\n\\n \\n\\nGubbio's ducal palace is moss grown and weedy, so far as its rooftop and\\ncourtyard are concerned, but it is a very warm and lively old fabric\\nnevertheless, and those that love historic old shrines will find much\\nhere that they will often not discover in a well restored, highly\\nfurbished monument kept frankly as a show-place for throngs of trippers\\nwho cannot tell old bronze from new copper, or wrought iron from font .\\n\\nThe hurly-burly of twentieth century life has not yet reached Gubbio,\\nand that is why it presents itself to the visitor within its walls in\\nsuch agreeable fashion.\\n\\nOff in the Marches, sixty-five kilometres from Gubbio, is the little\\ntown of Urbino. It has a Palazzo Ducale most remarkable in its\\narchitecture and its emplacement. It was begun in 1648 by Frederigo di\\nMontefeltro, on the site of a former palace of a century before. The\\napartments within are not merely the halls of a museum, but are\\nremarkably interesting and livable medi\\u00e6val apartments, and to-day are\\nmuch as they were in the days of the gallant dukes, one of whom,\\nGuidobaldo II, was a poet himself and a patron of letters who gave his\\nprotection to the last Italian poet whose fame was European -- Torquato\\nTasso.\\n\\nUrbino, too, was the birthplace of him whom we know familiarly as\\nRaphael, though curiously enough the local museum contains but a single\\nexample of his work, and that a drawing of \\\"Moses in the Bulrushes.\\\"\\n\\nUrbino's chief \\\"sight,\\\" though it is not beautiful in itself, is the\\nbirthplace of Raphael, situated in a little street running off from near\\nthe ducal palace, a street which mounts heavenward so steeply that it\\nwas formerly called the Via del Monte. The authorities, in an effort to\\nkeep up with popular taste, have recently changed the name to Via\\nRaffaello.\\n\\nIt is a mean, simple and grim looking little house, not at all beautiful\\naccording to palatial standards. On the 6th of April, 1483, its fame\\nbegan, but pilgrims have only in recent years come to bow down before\\nit. Nevertheless popes and prelates and princes came here to sit to the\\n\\\"painter of Urbino\\\" and have left an added distinction to the house.\\nMuzio Oddi, the celebrated architect and mathematician, caused to be\\ngraven the following on its fa\\u00e7ade: -- \\n\\n \\\"Ludet in humanis divina potentia rebus\\n Et saepe in parvis claudre magna solet.\\\"\\n\\nA tablet marks the house plainly. It will not be possible to miss it.\\n\\nUrbino sits high above the surrounding valley, twelve or fifteen hundred\\nfeet above sea level. A coach of doubtful antiquity formerly made the\\nsame journey as that covered by the railway and deposited its mixed\\nfreight of travellers and inhabitants in one of the most splendid of the\\nRenaissance cities of Italy. Now, the automobile brings many more\\ntourists than ever before came by coach, or railway even, and\\naccordingly Urbino will undoubtedly become better known.\\n\\nThe court of Urbino in the sixteenth century was one of the most refined\\nand learned of the courts of Italy, and therefore of the world. Coryat\\nin his \\\"Crudities,\\\" of the seventeenth century, remarks a difference\\nbetween English and Italian manners.\\n\\n\\\"I observed a custom in all those Italian cities and towns through which\\nI passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw in my\\ntravels; neither do I think that any other nation of Christendom doth\\nuse it, but only Italy. The Italian, and also most strangers that are\\ncommorant in Italy, do always at their meals use a little fork when they\\ncut their meat.\\\" Is it that the fork came to earth as a seventeenth\\ncentury Italian innovation?\\n\\nUrbino's Albergo Italia merits the sign of the crossed knife and fork,\\nthe Automobile Club's endorsement of good food.\\n\\nOne of the classic figures of medi\\u00e6val Urbino was Oddantonio, of the\\ngreat house of Montefeltro, who, succeeding to the dukedom at the age of\\nfifteen, fell under the ill control of the brilliant, but corrupt,\\nSigismondo Malatesta, of Rimini.\\n\\nThirty five kilometres east of Urbino lies the blue Adriatic, perhaps\\nthe most beautiful of all the Italian seas. The descent from four\\nhundred metres at Urbino to sea level is gradual and easy, but it is a\\nsteady fall that is bound to be remarked by travellers by road, with the\\nsea in sight for the major part of the way.\\n\\nOne comes to the Adriatic shore at Pesaro, midway on the coast between\\nRavenna and Ancona. North and south, from the Venetian boundary to the\\nrocky, sparse-populated shores of Calabria, flanking upon the Ionian\\nsea, is a wonderland of little-travelled highroad, all of it a historic\\nitinerary, though indeed the road is none of the best. To the jaded\\ntraveller, tired of stock sights and scenes, the covering of this coast\\nroad from Venice to Brindisi would be a journey worth the making, but it\\nshould not be done hurriedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nBY ADRIATIC'S SHORE\\n\\n\\nThe Italian shore of the Adriatic is a terra incognita to most\\ntravellers in Italy, save those who take ship for the east at Brindisi,\\nand even they arrive from Calais, Paris or Ostende by express train\\nwithout break of journey en route.\\n\\nThe following table gives the kilometric distances of this shore road by\\nthe Adriatic, through the coast towns from Otranto in Pouilles to\\nChioggia in Venetia. The itinerary has, perhaps, never been made in its\\nentirety by any stranger automobilist, but the writer has seen enough to\\nmake him want to cover its entire length.\\n\\n Population Kilometres\\n Otranto 22,266 0\\n Lecce 2,333 40.4\\n Brindisi 16,719 80\\n Monopoli 7,620 151\\n Bari 58,266 193.3\\n Barletta 31,194 248.2\\n Manfredonia 8,324 330\\n Foggia 14,067 368.4\\n\\nHere the road leaves the coast but joins again at Ortona.\\n\\n Isernia 7,687 526.7\\n Ortona 6,366 673.5\\n Pescara 2,612 694.3\\n Ancona 28,577 849.7\\n Pesaro 12,547 909.7\\n Rimini 10,838 945.3\\n Ravenna 18,571 995.3\\n Ferrara 28,814 1,068.7\\n Chioggia 20,381 1,160.5\\n\\nThe above are the cold figures as worked out from the Road Books, Maps\\nand Profiles of the Touring Club Italiano. The whole forms a rather\\nlengthy itinerary but, in part, it is within the power of every\\nautomobilist in Italy to make, as he crosses Umbria from Rome to the\\nAdriatic, by including that portion of the route between Ancona and\\nChioggia. This cuts the distance to the more reasonable figure of a\\nlittle more than three hundred kilometres.\\n\\nTaranto, Otranto and Bari are mere place names for which most do not\\neven know where to look on the map. Conditions of life were not easy or\\nluxurious here in the outposts of the western empire, and the influx of\\nalien Greek and Turk and Jew has ever tended to change the Italian\\ncolouring to one almost Oriental in tone and brilliance.\\n\\nBrindisi has usually been considered a mere way station on the\\ntraveller's itinerary, where he changes train for boat. But it is more\\nthan that. It was the ancient Brentesion of the Greeks, indeed it was\\nthe gateway of all intercourse between the peninsula and the Greece of\\nthe mainland and the islands of \\u00c6gina.\\n\\nVirgil died here on his return from Greece in 19 B.C., and for that\\nreason alone it at once takes rank as one of the world's great literary\\nshrines. But who ever heard of a literary pilgrim coming here!\\n\\nBrindisi's Castello, built by Ferdinand II and Charles V, still\\noverlooks the harbour and, though it performs no more the functions of a\\nfortress, it is an imposing and admirable medi\\u00e6val monument.\\n\\nNear the harbour is a svelt Greek column with a highly sculptured\\ncapital and an inscription to the memory of a Byzantine ruler who built\\nup the city anew in the tenth century, after it had fallen prey to the\\nSaracens. This column, too, supposedly marks the termination of the\\nAppian Way, which started from Rome's Forum and wandered across the\\nCampagna and on to this eastern outpost.\\n\\n \\n\\nBari, like Brindisi, was an ancient seaport. Horace sang its praises, or\\nrather the praises of its fish, as did Petrarch of the carp at Vaucluse,\\nand the town was one of the most ancient bishoprics in Italy.\\n\\nFrom the tenth to the fourteenth century the fate of the town was ever\\nin the balance, changing its allegiance from one seigneur to another,\\nwho, for the moment, happened to be the more masterful. In the\\nfourteenth century it became an independent Duchy, and in 1558 was\\nunited with the kingdom of Naples.\\n\\nBari's Castello was built in 1160 and, like that at Brindisi, is of that\\ngrim militant aspect which bespeaks, if not deeds of romance, at least\\nthose of valour.\\n\\nIn the Piazza Mercanto is a great bronze lion wearing an exaggerated\\ndog-collar on which is inscribed the \\\"Custos Justiti\\u00e6,\\\" the heraldic\\nmotto and device of the city.\\n\\nManfredonia, Termoli, Ortona and Pescara are all of them charming\\nAdriatic towns, each and all possessed of vivid reminders of the days of\\nthe corsairs, adventurers and pirate Saracen hordes. Their battlemented\\nwalls and castles still exist in the real, and little of twentieth\\ncentury progress has, as yet, made its mark upon them. Mythology,\\nhistory and romance have here combined.\\n\\nAncona is not included in every one's Italian itinerary. This is the\\nmore to be regretted in that it is very accessible, not only by road but\\nby rail from Ravenna or Perugia, or by sea, in eight or ten hours, from\\nVenice. The city of fifty thousand inhabitants, with a Ghetto of six\\nthousand Jews, is beautifully situated on an amphitheatre of hills\\noverlooking the Adriatic. The mole which encloses its harbour supports\\ntwo triumphal arches, making a sort of monumental water-gate unequalled\\nby anything similar in all the world. One of these arches was erected by\\nthe Roman Senate in 122, to the honour of Trajan, and the other in\\nhonour of Pope Clement XII in 1740.\\n\\nTrajan undoubtedly deserved the honour. It was he who was the first to\\nhold that \\\"it was better a thousand guilty persons should escape than\\nthat one innocent person should be condemned.\\\" When he appointed\\nSubarranus Captain of the Guard, he presented him, according to custom,\\nwith a drawn sword, saying, as he handed it, these memorable words:\\n\\\" Pro me, si merear, in me \\\" (\\\"Use this sword for me: If I deserve it,\\nagainst me\\\"). It is good to know that men like these may have\\nmemorial arches as well as mere cut-throat conquerors.\\n\\n \\n\\nEvery student of Italian architecture knows Piranesi's drawing of the\\nfamous Trajan arch at Ancona. It was more truthful than many of his\\ndrawings of Roman antiquities, and might indeed have been made in these\\nlatter years, for little is changed on Ancona's seafront.\\n\\nThere is at Ancona a memory of Filippo Lippi, a monkish draughtsman of\\ngreat ability, a contemporary of the better known Fra Angelico.\\n\\nOnce he set out on the blue waters of the Adriatic, from the very steps\\nbelow the Arch of Trajan where the waves lap to-day, for a little sail.\\nLike many people who make excursions in boats, he was unskilful, and\\nworse, for, drifting out to sea, he was in due time picked up by a\\nBarbary pirate and next put foot on shore in Africa. He drew the pirate\\nchief's portrait on the wall of his prison, and in spite of the\\ninterdiction of the Koran, the Moor was pleased and gave the Fra his\\nliberty forthwith, taking him back to within sight of Trajan's arch,\\nwhen he was precipitately put over side and made to swim ashore, the\\npirate returning from whence he came.\\n\\nSenegallia, between Ancona and Pesaro, was an appanage of the Dukes of\\nUrbino. It is an enchanting, unworldly little town, even to-day, its\\ngreat protecting walls pierced by six gateways, the same through which a\\nwhole hierarchy of conquerors passed in the long ago. It is a place of\\ndreams, if one is given to that sort of thing. The Medi\\u00e6val Palazzo\\nCommunal is still in evidence, and the little creek-like harbour is full\\nof wobbly little boats with painted masts and sails, all most quaint.\\nBehind are the gentle slopes of vine-clad hills shutting out the western\\nworld beyond.\\n\\nPesaro, the ancient Pisaurum, is the capital of the united provinces of\\nPesaro and Urbino. The Malatesta, the Sforza and the Rovere families all\\nruled its destinies in their time, and the little capital came to be a\\nliterary and art centre which, in a small way, rivalled its more opulent\\ncompeers.\\n\\nPesaro's ducal palace is, in a way, a monument to the Queen Lucrezia\\nBorgia, as is the rude fortress of the walls a memory of Giovanni\\nSforza, her first husband. At the age of twenty-six, Giovanni married\\nthe daughter of Alessandro Borgia, who was but thirteen, and brought his\\nbride forthwith, blessed with the Papal benediction, to this bijou of a\\npalace where f\\u00eates and merrymakings of a most prodigal sort went on\\nfor many nights and days.\\n\\n \\n\\nBack to the coast and one comes to Rimini, the southern terminus of the\\nVia \\u00c6milia. Rimini's Arco d'Augusto was erected as a memorial to the\\ngreat Augustus in 27 B. C. The Ponte d'Augusto, too, is a monument of\\nthe times, which date back nearly nineteen centuries. It was begun in\\nthe last year of the life of Augustus.\\n\\nThe Palazzo del Comune contains the municipal picture-gallery, and\\nbefore it stands a bronze statue of Pope Paul V, but the greatest\\ninterest lies in the contemplation of the now ruined and dilapidated\\nCastel Malatesta. Its walls are grim and sturdy still, but it is nothing\\nbut a hollow mockery of a castle to-day, as it has been relegated to use\\nas a prison and stripped of all its luxurious belongings of the days of\\nthe Malatesta. The family arms in cut stone still appear above the\\nportal.\\n\\nThe chief figure of Rimini's old time portrait gallery was the famous\\nLord of Rimini, Sigismondo Malatesta, a man of exquisite taste, a patron\\nof the arts, a sincere lover of beauty.\\n\\nFrom Rimini to Ravenna, still within sight of the Adriatic's waves, is\\nsome fifty kilometres by road or rail, through a low, marshy,\\nunwholesome-looking region, half aquatic, half terrestrial.\\n\\nLa Pineta, or the Pine Forest, the same whose praises were sung by\\nDante, Boccaccio, Dryden and Byron, and which supplied the timber for\\nthe Venetian ships of the Republic's heyday is in full view from\\nRavenna's walls.\\n\\nBoccaccio made the Pineta the scene of his singular tale, \\\"Nostagio\\ndegli Onesti\\\"; the incidents of which, ending in the amorous conversion\\nof the ladies of Ravenna, have been made familiar to the English reader\\nby Dryden's adoption of them in his \\\"Theodore and Honoria.\\\"\\n\\n \\\"Where the last C\\u00e6sarean fortress stood,\\n Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore\\n And Dryden's lay made haunted ground.\\\"\\n\\nRavenna sits grim and proud in the very midst of wide, flat, marshy\\nplains across which straight arrow-like roads roll out seemingly\\ninterminable kilometres to the joy of the automobilist and the despair\\nof the traveller with a hired hack. The region between Ravenna and the\\nsea is literally half land, half water, marshes partitioned off by\\ncanals and pools stretching away in every direction. It is lone and\\nstrange, but it is not sad and above all is most impressive. Turn out\\nof any of Ravenna's great gates and the aspect is invariably the same.\\nGreat ox-carts, peasants in the fields and, far away, the brown sails of\\nthe Adriatic fishing boats are the only punctuating notes of a landscape\\nwhich is anything but gay and lively. It is as Holland under a medi\\u00e6val\\nsun, for mostly the sun shines brilliantly here, which it does not in\\nthe Low Countries. Ravenna was the ancient capital of the Occidental\\nRoman Empire, but to-day, in its marshy site, the city is in anything\\nbut the proud estate it once occupied. The aspect of the whole city is\\nas weird and strange as that of its site. It is of far too great an area\\nfor the few thousand pallid mortals who live there. It has ever been a\\ntheatre of crime, disaster and disappointment, but its very walls and\\ngateways echo a mysterious and penetrating charm. It possesses, even\\nto-day, though more or less in fragments it is true, many structures\\ndating from the fifth to the eighth centuries, though of its old Palace\\nof the C\\u00e6sars but a few crumbled stones remain. Ravenna is the home of\\nthe classic typical Christian architecture which went out broadcast\\nthrough Europe in the middle ages. The Palace of Theodoric hardly exists\\nas a ruin, but some poor ugly stone piers are commonly granted the\\ndignity of once having belonged to it, as well as an ancient wall of\\nbrick.\\n\\nTheodoric's tomb is in La Rotonda, a kilometre or more from Ravenna in\\nthe midst of a vineyard. The earliest portrait in Ravenna's great\\ngallery of notables is that of Theodoric, an art-loving ruler, an\\nenlightened administrator, with simple, devout ideas, and a habit of\\nnightly vigils. Ravenna was to him a world, a rich golden world,\\npolished yet primitive.\\n\\nAside from its magnificent churches, Ravenna's monuments are not many or\\ngreat.\\n\\nThere is Theodoric's Palace before mentioned, the Archiepiscopal Palace,\\na restored work of the sixteenth century, and the Palazzo Governativo\\nbuilt in the eighteenth century, with many splendid fragments -- columns\\nand the like -- of an earlier period incorporated therein.\\n\\nOn the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele are two great granite columns, erected\\nin 1484 by the Venetians, and some fragments of a colonnade or loggia\\nwhich may be a part of the Hall of Justice of Theodoric's time.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe tomb of Dante is near the church of San Francesco. It is an uncouth\\nshrine which covers the poet's remains, but it ranks high among\\nthose of its class from more sincere motives than those which usually\\ninduce one to rave over more pompous and more splendid charms.\\n\\n \\\" Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar ,\\\"\\n\\nsang Byron.\\n\\nNorthward from Ravenna, but in roundabout fashion whether one goes by\\nroad or rail is Comacchio. Comacchio is four kilometres from the\\nAdriatic and forty-four from Ferrara. Ariosto called the inhabitants: -- \\n\\n \\\".... gente desiosa\\n Che il mar si turbi e sieno i venti atroci ,\\\"\\n\\nbut this need not deter the seeker after new sensations from going there\\nto see them catch eels on a wholesale plan, and handle them afterwards\\nin a manner of cleanliness and with a rapidity which is truly\\nmarvellous.\\n\\nThey are caught by wholesale, and a tagliatore armed with a\\nuseful-looking hatchet called a manarino chops them into pieces called\\n morelli . After this the eels are cooked on a great open-fire spit and\\nfinally packed in boiling oil, like the little fishes of the Breton\\ncoast, and ultimately sold and served as hors d'oeuvres in Italian\\nrestaurants the world over. North of Comacchio on the shore of a\\nVenetian lagoon is Chioggia.\\n\\nChioggia has no great architectural or historical monuments, but is as\\npaintable as Venice itself; indeed, it is a little brother to Venice,\\nbut lacking its splendour and great palaces. Its quay-side Madonna is\\nvenerated by all the fishing folk round about.\\n\\nVenice early conquered Chioggia and in turn the Genoese came along and\\ntook it from their rival in 1379, though the Venetians within the year\\ngot it back again. With such a fate ever hanging over it, Chioggia had\\nnot great encouragement to build great palaces and so its inhabitants\\nturned to fishing and have always kept at it.\\n\\nUnless one is crossing direct from Florence to Venice, by the Futa Pass\\nand Bologna, Ferrara, as a stopping place on one's Italian itinerary, is\\nbest reached from Ravenna. The road is flat, generally well-conditioned\\nand covers a matter of seventy kilometres, mostly within sight of the\\nsea or lagoons, more like Holland even than the country through which\\none has recently passed.\\n\\n \\n\\nOf all the romantic Renaissance shrines of Italy none have a more\\npotent attraction than Ferrara.\\n\\nThe Ferrara of the Middle Ages, like the Ferrara of to-day, is a\\nparadox. No Italian State of similar power and magnificence ever exerted\\nsuch disproportionate influence upon medi\\u00e6val Italy; no city in United\\nItaly in which are so combined the fascinating treasures of the past and\\nmodern political and industrial enterprise is so ignored by the casual\\ntraveller. Once the strongest post on the frontier of the Papal States,\\nthe seat of the House of Este, the abiding place of Torquato Tasso and\\nLudovico Ariosto, and the final marital home of Lucrezia Borgia, the\\ngolden period of its sixteenth century magnificence has sunk into an\\nisolation unheeded by contingent development, and its inhabitants have\\nshrunken to a bare third of their former numbers.\\n\\nThe ducal family of Este lived the life of the times to the limit of\\ntheir powers. They, one and all, inherited a taste for crimes of various\\nshades, just as they inherited the love of art. Alfonso, Duke of\\nFerrara, had no profound moral sense in spite of his finer instincts,\\nand was so \\\"liberal minded\\\" that he shocked Bayard, the \\\" chevalier sans\\npeur et sans reproche ,\\\" into crossing himself \\\"more than ten times\\\" as\\nan antidote, when he first came into the ducal presence.\\n\\n \\n\\nFerrara's castello or castel vecchio, which is better known as its ducal\\nch\\u00e2teau, is a remarkable specimen of military architecture. On Saint\\nMichael's Day, 1385, its first stones were put in place by Bartolina di\\nNovara, and the ardour of the workmen was so great that at the end of\\nsixteen months the work was completed as it is to-day, with its\\ntowers, its doubly thick walls, and all its brutal force.\\n\\n \\n\\nA fosse surrounds the edifice, and two gateways only give access to the\\ninterior. Under Alphonso I certain embellishments were added to the old\\ncastle, bringing it up to the times in luxurious decorative details and\\nthe like. The rude feudal castle now became virtually a residential\\nch\\u00e2teau. The crenelated battlements were transformed into mere parapets,\\nthe chemins de ronde into terraces and hanging gardens.\\n\\nPictures and frescoes were at this time added liberally, and, though\\nto-day many of these have been dispersed to the four corners of Europe,\\nenough remain to indicate the importance of these new embellishments.\\n\\nThe cachots or dungeon cells still exist, and are regarded -- by the\\nguardian -- as one of the chief \\\"sights.\\\" Some others may think\\ndifferently.\\n\\nThe house of Ariosto is one of Ferrara's most popular attractions,\\nthough indeed it is not remarkable architecturally. Ariosto was one of\\nthe brilliant figures of the Ferrara court, but his house was modest and\\nbare, as is remarked by a tablet which it bore in the poet's time, and\\non which was carved in Latin: \\\"My house is small but was built for my\\nown convenience and entirely with my own money.\\\" How many householders\\nof to-day can say the same?\\n\\nIn the hospital in the southern quarter of the town is still to be seen\\nthe prison cell commonly assigned to Tasso. On the walls are scribbled\\nthe names of Lord Byron and Casimir Delavigne and Lamartine's verses on\\nTasso, and over the door runs the inscription -- \\n\\n + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+\\n | \\\"INGRESSO ALLA PRIGIONE DI TORQUATO TASSO.\\\" |\\n + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+\\n\\nFor seven years and more Tasso lived within these four narrow walls.\\n\\n \\\"Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets\\n Whose symmetry was not for solitude,\\n There seems as 'twere a curse upon the seats\\n Of former sovereigns, and the antique brood\\n Of Este....\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\n And Tasso is their glory and their shame.\\\"\\n \\\" Childe Harold. \\\"\\n\\nClosely bound with Ferrara and the fortunes of the family of Este is the\\ntown of that name midway between Ferrara and Padua at the foot of the\\nEuganean Hills. The ancestral residence of the family of Este is here,\\nbut in a more or less ruinous state to-day.\\n\\nThe \\\"Rocca\\\" or Castle of Este was erected in 1343 by Ulbertino Carrara,\\nand repaired by the Scaligers during their temporary possession of it.\\nIt is a noble dungeon tower, with frowning embrasures and battlements,\\nand stands at least upon the site of the original fortress. Alberto Azzo\\n(born 996) was the more immediate founder of the house here on the death\\nof the Emperor Henry III. The ancestry of Alberto may be traced in\\nhistory to Bonifazio, Duke or Marquis of Tuscany, in 811. Poetry carries\\nit much higher. The magician, in the vision of the enchanted shield,\\nenables Rinaldo to behold Caius Attius as his remote ancestor: -- \\n\\n \\\"Mostragli Caio allor, ch'a strane genti\\n Va prima in preda il gia inclinato Impero,\\n Prendere il fren de' popoli volenti,\\n E farsi d'Este il Principe primiero;\\n E a lui ricoverarsi i men potenti\\n Vicini, a cui Rettor facea mestiero,\\n Poscia, quando ripassi il varco noto,\\n A gli inviti d'Honorio il fero Goto.\\\"\\n -- Orlando Furioso. \\n\\nGuelph, Duke of Bavaria (succeeded 1071), from whom all the branches of\\nthe House of Brunswick are descended, was the son of Alberto Azzo,\\nMarquis of Este, by his first wife, Cunegunda, a princess of the Suabian\\nline.\\n\\nFulco I, Marquis of Italy and Lord of Este, the son of Alberto Azzo by\\nhis second wife, Garisenda, daughter of Herbert, Count of Maine, was the\\nfounder of the Italian branch from which the Dukes of Ferrara and Modena\\ndescended, the male line of which became extinct at the end of the last\\ncentury. The Duke of Modena, who was deposed in the mid-nineteenth\\ncentury, represented the house of Este in the female line, -- his\\ngrandmother, Maria Beatrix, having been the last descendant of the\\nItalian branch. Este continued in the possession of the descendants of\\nAlberto until 1294, when it fell an easy conquest to the Carraras.\\nSuccessively a dependency of Padua and of the Verona Scaligers, it\\npassed to Venice in 1405, retaining its local government and municipal\\ninstitutions.\\n\\nNear Este is Arqua, where Petrarch died in 1374. It has been a literary\\nshrine since 1650, for a chronicler of that time remarks it as one of\\nthe things to come to Italy to see. The house is still to be seen, and\\nthe sarcophagus containing his remains and an inscription beginning -- \\n\\n \\\" Frigida Francisci lopis hic tegit ossa Petrarce \\\"\\n\\nis before the tiny church of this little frequented and little exploited\\nvillage.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nON THE VIA \\u00c6MILIA\\n\\n\\nThe Via \\u00c6milia of antiquity is a wonder to-day, or would be if it were\\nkept in a little better repair. As it is, it is as good a road as any\\n\\\"good road\\\" in Italy, and straight as an arrow, as it runs boldly from\\nthe Adriatic at Rimini to Piacenza, through the ancient States of\\nBologna, Modena and Parma.\\n\\nNo automobilist who ever rolls off its length of 262 kilometres will\\nclass it as inferior to any other Italian road of its class.\\n\\nThe following categorical mention of the cities and towns on this great\\nRoman way presents their varied charms in a sufficient number, surely,\\nto make the hurried north or southbound traveller think it worth while\\nto zigzag about a bit, in going from Florence to Venice, in order to\\nvisit them all.\\n\\nThe first place of note after leaving Rimini is Cesana -- \\\"She whose flank\\nis washed by Savio's wave,\\\" Dante wrote.\\n\\nCesana is full of reminders of the profligate C\\u00e6sar Borgia. The library\\nof Cesana was famous in medi\\u00e6val times and held its head high among the\\ncity's other glories. Above all was the famous Rocca of Cesana, a\\nfortress ch\\u00e2teau of great strength in days when feudal lords needed a\\nwarren into which they might run and hide at every league.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Publico is a square, sturdy, none too lovely building with\\nsome notable pictures within, and a statue of Pius VII, who was a native\\nof the place.\\n\\nIn the stirring times of the pontificate of Gregorius XI, the Avignon\\nPope sent a cut-throat Cardinal into Italy at the head of a band of\\nsoldiery who entered and pillaged Cesana in 1377. His cry at the head of\\nhis troops was ever: \\\"Blood! more blood! Kill! Kill! Kill!\\\" A nice sort\\nof a man for a Cardinal Prince of the Church!\\n\\nThe highroad between Cesana and Rimini passes through the valley of the\\nRubicon. Mule tracks, sloping hills and olive groves are the chief\\ncharacteristics of this vale, the spot where C\\u00e6sar apocryphally crossed\\nthe Rubicon. Historians up to Montesquieu's time seemed to take it for\\ngranted, but latterly it has been denied.\\n\\nForli and Imola were the principal towns of Romagna, the patrimony of\\nCatherine Sforza and Girolamo Riario, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. When the\\nnew married pair first came to their little State from Rome the\\nRenaissance was at its height, and the ambitious bride sought, so far as\\npossible, to surround herself with its splendours. Their reign in the\\neast was not happy; Girolamo proved a tyrant, and was promptly\\nassassinated by his followers, leaving Catherine and her five children\\ncompletely in the power of his murderers, who made her give up her\\nclaims to her little kingdom. She consented, or pretended to consent.\\nShe conspired with the Governor of the fortress, Tommaso Feo, and\\nappeared on its ramparts dressed as a warrior. She refused to surrender,\\nand when it was recalled that she had left her children behind as\\nhostages she cruelly replied: \\\"In time I shall have others.\\\" Catherine\\nSforza was a bloodthirsty vixen, surely.\\n\\nForli was Catherine Sforza's own city, and her defence of it against the\\nBorgias was one of the celebrated sieges of history. She held out two\\nyears, and then only gave in because she was betrayed. Her very reason\\nof warring with the Borgias reflects greatly on her credit. She refused\\nsimply to allow her son to marry the aging Lucrezia; \\\"not so much on\\naccount of her age,\\\" said Catherine, \\\"as her morals.\\\" Princely marriages\\nare often carried out on different lines to-day.\\n\\nAlmost within sight of Forli is Fa\\u00ebnza, a city which was under the\\ndomination of the Manfredi when C\\u00e6sar Borgia took it into his head to\\nmove against it. A young prince by the name of Astor III, but eighteen\\nyears of age, beloved by all for his amiability, grace and youth, held\\nits future in his hands. When the key of Fa\\u00ebnza, Brisighella, fell to\\nthe Borgia's captain of artillery in the early days of November in 1500,\\nthe emperor-like C\\u00e6sar himself came forward and took command. He offered\\nlife to the dwellers within the walls if they would surrender, but they\\nwould have none of it, for, as the Borgia wrote in a letter to the Duc\\nd'Urbino, dated from \\\"the pontifical camp before Fa\\u00ebnza,\\\" a \\\"dramatic\\ndefence was made by the citizens of the town.\\\" This \\\"dramatic defence\\\"\\nwas such that it compelled Borgia and his papal soldiers to go into\\nwinter quarters. The struggle was the longest that Borgia had yet\\nundertaken in his campaigns, and the women of Fa\\u00ebnza, as did Catherine\\nSforza at Forli, covered themselves with glory.\\n\\nA daughter of a soldier of the garrison, Diamante Jovelli, put herself\\nat the head of a band of Amazons who took entire charge of the\\ncommissariat, the handling of the munitions of war, and served as\\nsentinels, repairing the walls even when breached -- rough work for women.\\n\\\"The women of Fa\\u00ebnza have saved the honour of Italy,\\\" wrote Isabella\\nd'Este in 1501 to her husband, the Duke of Mantua, and C\\u00e6sar Borgia\\nhimself committed himself to paper with the following words: \\\"Would that\\nI had an entire army of the women of Fa\\u00ebnza.\\\" The city fell in due time,\\nand the crafty C\\u00e6sar honoured the gallant Manfredi, \\\"crowned with the\\nlaurels of valour and misfortune,\\\" by allowing him \\\"a guard of honour\\nand all his proper dignities.\\\" Later the Borgia repented of his\\ngenerosity, and sent the young and gallant prince to Rome, and\\nimprisoned him in the Castle of Sant'Angelo for a year.\\n\\nFa\\u00ebnza is a very ancient town, and less populous to-day than it was\\nfifty years ago, when also it was less populous than it was five hundred\\nyears ago.\\n\\nImola, the seventh place of importance on the \\u00c6milian itinerary counting\\nfrom Rimini, was the ancient Forum Cornelii, but by Charlemagne's time\\nit had already become known by its present name. In the middle ages\\nImola's geographical position, midway between Bologna and Romagna, made\\nit an important acquisition in the contests for power. It was\\nsuccessfully held by many different chiefs, and was united to the States\\nof the Church under Julius II. As one of the stations on the \\u00c6milian\\nWay, it was a place of some importance; it is mentioned by Cicero, and\\nby Martial: -- \\n\\n \\\"Si veneris unde requiret,\\n \\u00c6mili\\u00e6 dices de regione vi\\u00e6.\\n Si quibus in terris, qua simus in urbe rogabit,\\n Corneli referas me, licet, esse Foro.\\\"\\n\\nThe fortress ch\\u00e2teau of Imola was almost identical in form with that of\\nForli, quadrilateral with four great towers at the angles, and a\\ncrenelated battlement at the skyline.\\n\\nC\\u00e6sar Borgia brought this fortress to ignoble surrender in 1499, but\\nsince the fortress was then quite independent of the city he had still\\nanother task before him before the inhabitants actually came within his\\npowers. A fortnight after the capture of the fortress the city itself\\nfell. Imola was a part of the marriage dot of Catherine Sforza, who\\nconfided its defence to Dionigi di Naldo while she busied herself at\\nForli, where she reigned as widow and inheritor of Riario Sforza.\\n\\nOn towards Bologna one passes Castel San Pietro, a thirteenth century\\nfortified town still sleeping its dull time away since no war or rumours\\nof war give it concern. Quaderna, even less progressive and important\\nto-day than its neighbour, was the important station of Claternum in the\\ndays when traffic on the great \\u00c6milian way was greater than now.\\n\\nBologna's towers and domes loom large on the horizon as one draws up on\\nthis great capital from any direction. Bologna, because of its easy\\naccess, is one of the popular tourist points of Italy, and for that\\nreason it is omitted from nobody's itinerary, though most hurried\\ntravellers remember the mortadella better than they do the cathedral,\\nwhich in truth is nothing very fine so far as architectural masterpieces\\ngo.\\n\\nThe roads in and out of Bologna are quite the best to be found\\nneighbouring upon a large city in Italy. They shall not be described\\nfurther, the mere statement that this is so should be taken as\\nsufficient praise.\\n\\nThe streets within the gates too, though paved, are splendidly straight\\nand smooth, though encumbered at one or two awkward corners with tram\\ntracks.\\n\\nThe visitor to Bologna may take his ease at the Hotel Brun, quite the\\nmost distinguished hotel in all Italy, not even excepting Daniellis or\\nthe Grand at Venice, each of them a palazzo of long ago.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Hotel Brun is a red brick palace of imposing presence, with a\\ndelightful courtyard where you may stable your automobile along side of\\nthose of most of the touring nobility of Europe at a cost of two and a\\nhalf francs a night. The hotel in spite of this is excellent in every\\nway.\\n\\nBologna is surrounded by a city wall pierced by twelve gateways and thus\\nwell preserves its medi\\u00e6val effect in spite of its theatres, caf\\u00e9s and\\nrestaurants, which are decidedly modern and unlovely.\\n\\nBologna when it was conquered by the Gauls took the name of Bononia.\\nUnder Charlemagne it became a free city and had for its device the\\nequivalent of the word Liberty.\\n\\nBologna, the ancient city, proud in the middle ages and independent\\nalways, has ever been the cradle of disturbing factions, a revolutionary\\nprecursor of new ideas, and has been sold and sold again by first one\\nJudas and then another.\\n\\nBologna is, taking its history, its present day prosperity and its still\\nexisting medi\\u00e6val monuments into consideration, the most impressive and\\nimposing of all the secondary cities of Italy, indeed in many of the\\nthings that impress the traveller it is ahead, far ahead, of Florence.\\n\\nPaul Van Herle, a fifteenth century Dutchman, first called the city\\n Bologna la Grassa because of the opulency of the good things of the\\ntable which might be had here. Its wines and its grapes are superlative,\\nand its mortadella , or Bologna sausage, is, to many, a delicacy\\nwithout an equal.\\n\\n \\n\\nBologna seems to have a specialty of leaning towers, though the school\\nhistories and geographies always use that of Pisa to illustrate those\\narchitectural curiosities. Their histories are very romantic, and the\\nmere fact that they are out of perpendicular takes nothing away from\\ntheir charm. The two leaning brick towers of Bologna's Piazza di Porta\\nRavegnana, the Torri Asinelli and the Torri Gorisenda, the first nearly\\na hundred metres in height and the latter about half that height, are\\ntwo of the most remarkable structures ever erected by the hand of man.\\n\\nThe Asinelli tower was built in 1109, and its neighbour, which never\\nachieved its completion, in the following year.\\n\\nFrom Bologna to Modena is thirty-two kilometres and midway is Castel\\nFranco or Forte Urbano, as it is variously known. It was formerly the\\nForum Gallorum of the Romans and still has its castel little changed\\nfrom what it was in the days when Urban VIII built it.\\n\\nModena is mostly confounded by hurried travellers with Modane, though\\nthe latter is merely a railway junction where one is tumbled out in the\\nmiddle of the night to make his peace with railway and customs\\nofficials.\\n\\nModena's Palazzo Ducale, now the Palazzo Reale, was and is a vast, gaudy\\nconstruction, not lovely but overpowering with a certain crude grandeur.\\nA military school has now turned it to practical use. It never could\\nhave been good for much else. A picture gallery and C\\u00e6sar d'Este's\\nfamous library are quartered in the Albergo Arti, built by the Duke\\nFrancesco III in the seventeenth century.\\n\\nThe library Biblioteca Estense was brought from Ferrara in 1598 by\\nC\\u00e6sar d'Este on his expulsion by Clement VIII. It contained 100,000\\nvolumes and 3,000 MSS. Three of the most learned men in Italy during the\\nlast century -- Zaccaria, Tiraboschi and Muratori -- were its librarians.\\nAmongst the treasures were a gospel of the third century, a Dante with\\nminiature of the fourteenth century, a collection of several hundred\\nProven\\u00e7al poems, etc.\\n\\nModena was the birthplace of Mary of Modena, the fascinating princess\\nwho became the Italian Queen of the English people, the consort of James\\nII. She was an Italian Princess of the house of Este. Her mother was the\\nDuchess Laura of Modena, daughter of Count Martinozzi and Margaret\\nMazarini, cousin of the great Cardinal Mazarin, and she was married,\\nunder his auspices, at the Chapel Royal of Compi\\u00e8gne, in 1655, by proxy,\\nto Alfonso d'Este, hereditary Prince, and afterwards Duke Alfonso IV of\\nModena.\\n\\nWhen Lord Peterborough, the envoy of the Duke of York, was shown the\\nportrait of the Princess Mary he saw \\\"a young Creature about Fourteen\\nyears of Age; but such a light of Beauty, such Characters of Ingenuity\\nand Goodness as it surprised him, and fixt upon his Phancy that he had\\nfound his Mistress, and the Fortune of England.\\\" He made every effort to\\nmeet her personally, but in vain; so he was introduced, \\\"by means such\\nas might seem accidental,\\\" to the Abb\\u00e9 Rizzini, who was employed at\\nParis to negotiate the interests of the House of Este. This man\\nattributed \\\"many excellencies to Mary of Modena, yet he endeavoured to\\nmake them useless\\\" to them by saying that she and her mother wished that\\nshe might take the veil. It was later learned that obstacles were put in\\nthe Duke of York's way until he announced his willingness to become a\\nRoman Catholic.\\n\\nReggio in \\u00c6milia, passed on the road to Parma, is a snug little town,\\nsupposedly the birthplace of Ariosto. A house so marked compels popular\\nadmiration, but again it is possible that he was born within the\\ncitadel, since razed.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Duchies of Parma and Modena counted little in the political balance\\nin their day, but the f\\u00eates and spectacles of their courts were\\nfrequently brilliant.\\n\\nThe Duchy of Parma and of Piacenza was created in 1545 by the Pope Paul\\nIII for his son Pietro Farnese. Little of Parma's medi\\u00e6val character\\nremains to-day. The town is said to have been called Parma from its\\nsimilarity to the form of a shield. But the torrent Parma, which runs\\nthrough the city, crossed by three bridges, besides the railway bridge,\\nmost probably gave its name to the city which arose upon the banks. When\\nthe city was under the authority of the Popes it was represented by a\\nfemale figure sitting on a pile of shields, and holding a figure of\\nVictory, with the inscription of Parma aurea . Let the heraldic\\nstudents figure out any solution of the incident that they please, or\\nare able.\\n\\nThe Via \\u00c6milia divides the city, by means of the Strada M\\u00e6stra, into two\\nvery nearly equal parts. Parma, like Modena and Lucca, has changed its\\nfortification walls into boulevards, called \\\"Stradone,\\\" which are the\\nfavourite rendezvous for Parmesan high society when it goes out for a\\nstroll.\\n\\nNear Parma is Canossa, the site of an old fortified town, one day of\\nconsiderable importance, but now decayed beyond hope. Here the Emperor\\nHenry IV, bareheaded and barefooted, supplicated Pope Gregory V in 1077,\\nan incident of history not yet forgotten by the annalists of church and\\nstate.\\n\\nSoon after leaving Parma the Roman road crosses the river Taro, the\\nboundary frontier which shut off the Gaulish from the Ligurian tribes.\\nThe Brothers of the Bridge here built a great work of masonry in 1170,\\nobtaining money for the expense of the work by begging from the\\ntravellers passing to and fro on the \\u00c6milian Way. In time this old\\nbridge was carried away, and for centuries a ferry boat served the\\npurpose, until, in fact, the present structure came into being.\\n\\nBorgo San Donino, some twenty kilometres beyond the Taro, marks the\\nshrine of San Donino, a soldier in the army of Maximilian who became a\\nChristian and refused to worship as commanded by his Emperor. For this\\nhe was put to death on this spot, and for ever after Borgo San Donino\\nhas been one of the most frequented places of pilgrimage in Italy.\\n\\nFiorenzuola, still on the Via \\u00c6milia, a dozen kilometres farther on, has\\nstill an old tower to which hang fragments of an enormous chain by which\\ncriminals once were bound and swung aloft.\\n\\nAll through this fertile, abundant region through which runs the famous\\nRoman Road are numerous little borgos , or villages, bearing names\\nfamous in the history of Italy and its contemporary minor states.\\n\\nPiacenza was founded by the Gauls and was afterwards by the Romans named\\nPlacentia. It has ever prospered, though its career has been fraught\\nmore than once with danger of extinction. By the tenth century its great\\ntrading fair was famous throughout Europe.\\n\\n \\n\\nPiacenza is full of palaces, statues and monuments which merit the\\nconsideration of all serious minded persons, but the automobilist who\\nhas made the last fifty kilometres of the Via \\u00c6milia in the rain -- and\\nhow much it does rain in Italy only one who has travelled there by road\\nfor weeks really appreciates -- is first concerned as to where he may lay\\nhis head and house his car free from harm.\\n\\nThe Grand Hotel San Marco answers his needs well enough and has the\\nendorsement of the Touring Club de France as well as that of the\\nItalian Touring Club, but it is ridiculous that one is obliged to pay in\\na smug little Italian town of thirty-five thousand inhabitants five\\nfrancs a night for housing his automobile.\\n\\nPiacenza is on the direct road to the Italian Lakes via Milan, from\\nwhich it is distant seventy kilometres.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nIN VENETIA\\n\\n\\nThe mainland background of Venice, in its most comprehensive sense the\\nregion lying north of the Po and south and west of the Austrian\\nfrontier, is not a much-travelled region by any class of tourists in\\nItaly. The traveller by rail usually comes up from Bologna and Florence\\nand, with a stop at Padua, makes for Venice forthwith and leaves for the\\nItalian lake region, stopping en route at Verona. The automobilist too\\noften does the thing even more precipitately, by taking Padua and Verona\\nflying, or at least while he is stopping to replenish the inner man or\\nthe inner claims of his automobile. Certain readers of this book who may\\nperhaps have done the thing a little more thoroughly may claim that this\\nis an exaggeration, and so far as it applies to their particular case it\\nmay be, but the writer honestly believes that it fits astonishingly well\\nwith the majority of Italian itineraries in these parts. He bases this\\non the fact that he has seen tourists in droves in Padua and Verona, and\\nhe has not seen one in Este, Monselice, Battaglia, or even in Vicenza,\\nTreviso, Asolo or Udine.\\n\\n \\n\\nVerona, Vicenza and Padua were the capitals of three of the eight\\nancient provinces of Venezia.\\n\\nPadua is built in the midst of a vast plain which merits being called\\nItalian-Flanders. In everything but climate it is like a section of the\\nLow Countries, and the city, with its domes and towers, looms up over\\nthe low-lying plain, faint and ghostly from afar, like a mirage of the\\ndesert.\\n\\nCanals and fortress walls enclose the city even to-day, and the nearer\\none approaches, until one actually sees it from within the walls, the\\nless and less Padua becomes like Italy. The greatest interest of Padua\\ncentres undoubtedly in its church of Sant'Antonio, dedicated to the\\npious companion of Francis of Assisi; after that the University which\\nnumbered among its masters Erasmus, Mantius and Galileo, and among its\\nstudents Dante, Tasso and Petrarch. Padua is intimately associated with\\nthe name of Petrarch by reason of his having been a student here.\\nPetrarch died before Chaucer's time, but the Florentine's fame had gone\\nafield and from the \\\"Clerk's Tale\\\" one recalls the following:\\n\\n \\\"Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk,\\n Fraunceys Petrark, the laureat poete,\\n Highte this clerk, whose rethorike sweet\\n Enlumined al Itaille of poetrye.\\\"\\n\\nPadua in spite of its low lying situation is monumental at every turn.\\nThey had courage, the old builders, to plant great buildings down in the\\nmorass, and faith to believe they would last as long as they have.\\n\\nOn Padua's great Piazzas -- there are three of them, one leading out of\\nthe other -- rise the chief civic buildings of medi\\u00e6val times. The Loggia\\ndel Consiglio is an astonishingly ample Renaissance work of an early\\nperiod, access to its great hall being by a monumental exterior\\nstairway. An ancient column, with a San Marco lion is immediately in\\nfront.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Capitano, with its sky piercing clock tower of the\\nfourteenth century, was formerly the residence of the Venetian Governor,\\nand the Palazzo della Ragione, known as Il Salone, contains one of the\\nvastest single roofed apartments known. There is a long unobstructed\\ncorridor in the mosque of Saint Sophia at Constantinople which holds the\\nrecord in its line, but the Salone of Padua, built in 1420, is\\npre-eminent in superficial area.\\n\\nThe ancient Palace of the Carrera, tyrants of Padua, is one of the\\nthings that burn themselves in the mind from the sheer inability of one\\nto overlook them. When one sees the colossal frescoes of the Entrance\\nHall one repeats unconsciously the dictum of Victor Hugo over Madame\\nDorval -- the beautiful Madame Dorval: Je ne veux pas mourir .\\n\\nIt is the fashion to quote Dante and Byron and Shelley in Italy, but a\\nlittle of Alfred de Musset is a cheerful relief. Here are some of his\\nlines on Padua:\\n\\n \\n\\n \\\"Padoue est un fort bel endroit\\n O\\u00f9 de tr\\u00e8s-grands docteurs en droit\\n On fait merveille;\\n Mais j'aime mieux la polenta\\n Qu'on mange aux bords de la Brenta\\n Sous un treille.\\\"\\n\\nThe Albergo Fanti-Stella d'Oro at Padua is all sufficient as a tourist\\nhotel, but lacks a good deal of what a hotel for automobilists should\\nbe. There is accommodation for one's automobile in the coach house, but\\nit evidently is a separately owned concern, for when you come to take\\nyour auto out you will be followed like a thief when you try to explain\\nthat you prefer to pay the garage charges when you pay your hotel bill.\\nYou may eat \\u00e0 la carte in the hotel restaurant at any hour, and you\\nmay have a room across the way in the annex, a better room and for a\\nsmaller price than you can have at the Albergo itself. Altogether this\\nopera bouffe hotel is neither bad nor good, and most confusing as to its\\npersonnel and their conduct. They need to have a \\\"Who's Who,\\\" printed in\\nGerman, French and English to put into the hands of each guest on\\narrival.\\n\\nThe automobilist has not yet reached Venice. The nearest that he may\\ncome to it is to Mestre, where he may garage his automobile in any one\\nof half a dozen palatial establishments especially devoted to the\\npurpose. Mestre, of absolutely no rank whatever as a city of art or\\narchitecture or sights for the tourist, has more automobile garages than\\nany other city in Italy.\\n\\nThe splendour of Venice is undeniable, whether one takes note of its\\nunique architecture or of its remarkable site. Men with courage to build\\ngilded and marble palaces on a half submerged chain of isles scarce\\nabove the level of the sea do not live to-day. How well these early\\nbuilders planned is evinced by the fact that Venice the magnificent\\nexists to-day as it always has existed -- all but the Campanile. The fall\\nof this shows what may happen some day to the rest of this regal city.\\nWhen? No one knows. Men conquered the morass in the first instance. Can\\nthey hold it in subjection into eternity?\\n\\nVenice with all its gorgeousness is just the least bit triste .\\n\\nNot a tree worthy of the name, not a garden or a farm yard, not a cart\\nor a horse -- and not an automobile is to be found within its purlieus.\\nOne is as if in prison. A watery barrier surrounds one on every side.\\nThe sea, always the sea, mostly mirror-like or gently lapping its waves\\nat your very feet -- and black gondolas everywhere. Yes, Venice is\\ngorgeous, if you like, but how sad it is also!\\n\\nThe greatness of Venice dates from the time of the fourth crusade and\\nthe taking of Constantinople. It was then that the Venetian ships became\\nthe chief carriers between the east and the west; its vessels exported\\nthe surplus wealth of the Lombard plain, and brought in return not only\\nthe timber and stone of Istria and Dalmatia, but the manufactured wares\\nof Christian Constantinople, wines of the Greek isles, and the Oriental\\nsilks, carpets, and spices of Mohammedan Egypt, Arabia and Bagdad.\\n\\nThere used to be an old time saying at Venice that if the Isthmus of\\nSuez were pierced with a canal the glory of Venice would once more shine\\non the commercial world as well as shed its radiance over those who live\\nin the sphere of art. The Suez Canal has come, but prophets are not\\ninfallible, and the present maritime glory of the Adriatic lies with\\nTrieste and Fiume, with Venice a shadowy fifth or sixth in the whole of\\nItaly.\\n\\nIt is an historic fact that may well be repeated here, that Venice, more\\nthan any other city of Italy, has ever been noted for its passion for\\namusements and unconventional pleasures. \\\"For quite half of the year,\\\"\\nsaid Montesquieu, \\\"everybody wears a masque; manners are very free and\\nthe passion for gaming immense.\\\" A more vivid description of all this\\nVenetian disregard for convention may be found in the memoirs of the\\nVenetian adventurer Casanova.\\n\\nThe visitor to Venice must seek out for himself the things that interest\\nhim, with the aid of his guide-book, his hotel porter or his gondolier.\\nNot all its splendours can be pointed out here; the record of the author\\nand artist is a personal record; others if they will may choose a\\ndifferent itinerary.\\n\\nThe greatest fascination of all in Venice is undoubtedly the gondola,\\nthough the motor boat is pushing it hard for a place, and there be those\\nmatter-of-fact hurried tourists who prefer the practicality of the\\nlatter to the simplicity and romance of the former. The gondola still\\nreigns however, and probably always will. It's an asset for drawing\\ntourists as potent as the lions or horses of San Marco or the pigeons of\\nthe Piazzas.\\n\\nThe Venetian cannot step without his door without taking a gondola, for\\nhis promenade on the Grand Canal, to cross to the Lido, or to go to\\nchurch when he marries and when he dies. The gondola is as much a part\\nof the daily life of the Venetian as is the street car or the omnibus\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nThough it doesn't look it, the gondola is the most manageable craft\\npropelled by man. It snakes in and out of crooked waterways and comes to\\na landing with far less fuss than anything ever pushed by steam or\\ngasoline. All the same they are not as swift, though their pace is\\nastonishing when one considers their bulk and weight.\\n\\nIt has been the fashion to laud the sweet idealism of the gondola and\\nall that appertains thereto, not forgetting the gondolier, but when one\\nhas heard that backwater sailor's cajoleries and cadences beneath his\\nwindow for most of the long night one's views in the morning will be\\nconsiderably modified. \\\"Cousin of my dog!\\\" the gondolier will call his\\ngondola, \\\"Owl!\\\" \\\"Idiot!\\\" \\\"Sheriff of the Devil!\\\" \\\"Silly Ass!\\\" \\\"Miscreant\\nof Rhodes!\\\" and \\\"Bag of Bones.\\\" Such epithets shouted full and strong,\\nif only to an inanimate gondola, will take a good deal of idealism out\\nof nature.\\n\\nWith the Venetian palaces and churches and canals rank in popular\\ninterest its great piazzas. The importance of these great open spaces in\\nthe daily life of the people of the island city cannot be\\noverestimated. Gaiety, noise and life are the characteristics of each,\\nwhether one is at San Marco or on the Rialto.\\n\\nGastronomical delights in Italy are largely of one's own choosing. At\\nVenice, where, of Italian cities, the tourist is most largely catered\\nto, one may fare well or ill.\\n\\nIt's a great experience to sit at one of the little tables at Florian's,\\nor at the Aurora on the opposite side of the Piazza of San Marco, and\\nleisurely enjoy the spectacle spread out before one. At any time of the\\nday or night it is the most burning, feverish spot in all the Venetian\\narchipelago, though at midday, it is true, the sun-baked Piazza is\\ndeserted, even by the pigeons.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, as the shadows lengthen, and a slim suspicion of a\\nsea-breeze wafts in from the lagunes, it is fairyland, peopled, if not\\nwith fairyfolk, at least with as conglomerate a horde as may be seen in\\nEurope. As a performance the piece were almost worthy of its setting; it\\nis a burlesque and a comedy of manners in one. If only you are \\\"out of\\nseason,\\\" when the English and Americans and Germans are still by their\\nown firesides, and the cast of characters is made up of the peoples of\\nthe south and east, the comedy is all the more amusing, and you sip its\\ncharms as you sip your coffee and forget that such a personage as\\nBaedeker ever existed. Usually tourists come to the Piazza, after they\\nhave done the surrounding stock sights, to buy two soldi-worth of maize\\nand feed the pigeons. They would do better to watch the passing show\\nfrom the vantage point of a little table at Florian's.\\n\\nBesides its treasures of art and architecture, one of the sights of\\nVenice is Florian's, celebrated for a hundred and fifty years. The\\nspecialty of Florian's is the sabaion doro , made with the yellow of an\\negg and a small glass of Malaga. It is not bad, but it is a ladies'\\ndrink, for it is sweet. The sorbets , the caf\\u00e9 turc' and the vanilla\\nchocolates of the establishment, with the aforementioned golden\\nconcoction, have placed it in the very front rank among establishments\\nof its class. It remains open, or did a few years ago, all night. At\\nfive o'clock each morning, as the daylight gun went off from the\\nfortress of the Lido, Florian's put up its shutters, only to open just\\nbefore midday.\\n\\nThe names of the great who have gathered within the walls of this famous\\ncaf\\u00e9, and left memories behind them, would fill a long roster.\\nChateaubriand, Manzoni, Byron, Cimarosa, Canova, L\\u00e9opold-Robert, Alfred\\nde Musset, Balzac and others, many, many others. And many have left\\nbehind written souvenirs of their visit.\\n\\nOne thing the stranger to Venice will remark, and that is that here, as\\nmuch as in any other place in Italy, one is pestered nearly to\\ndistraction with the little \\\"extras\\\" of their hotel bills, of the\\ntoo-importunate guides, of door-openers and door shutters, of guardians\\nof all ranks, of men and boys who call your gondola for you, and of\\nmendicant ragamuffins by profession, or merely because occasion offered\\nand you looked like an \\\"easy mark.\\\" It is the one blight on Venice.\\n\\nThe modest inns of other days have given way to the demands of a more\\nexacting client\\u00e8le, but those who would follow Alfred de Musset and\\nGeorge Sand from the Palace of the Doges to the Hotel Danieli will have\\nno trouble in getting a lodging in that hostelry. Or they may prefer to\\nfollow the footsteps of Chateaubriand (who in truth was anticipating a\\nrendezvous with the Duchesse de Berry) to the neighbouring Hotel de\\nl'Europe.\\n\\n \\n\\nVenice's Grand Canal is naturally the chief delight of the visiting\\nstranger. The Canalazzo is from fifty to seventy metres wide with a\\nlength of three kilometres. A hundred and fifty or more palaces line\\nits banks, most of them bearing famous names of history. Shopkeepers and\\nmanufacturers of various sorts occupy many of them, but they are still\\ncapable of staggering any otherwise blas\\u00e9 curiosity-seekers. The\\naccompanying map with these palaces plainly marked should serve its\\npurpose better than quires of printed pages.\\n\\nShakespeare's \\\"Jew of Venice\\\" was no myth, whatever the shadowy\\nexistence of Juliet and Desdemona may have been. Venice in the middle\\nages had its Ghetto (a word which in Hebrew means \\\"cut off\\\" or \\\"shut\\noff\\\") where the Jews herded together and wore scarlet mantles in public\\nthat they might be known and recognized by faith and profession. The\\nprincipal character of \\\"The Merchant of Venice\\\" was a very real entity,\\nand Shakespeare, believing the saying of Tacitus, wrote him down\\ntruthfully as a man scrupulously faithful to his engagements, charitable\\nto others of his race, but filled with an invincible hatred towards all\\nother men.\\n\\n \\n\\nAnother Venetian type, not wholly disappeared to-day, is that of the\\nVenetian blonde of Titian, Veronese and Giorgione, a type of feminine\\nbeauty unknown elsewhere. Italians are commonly brunettes, and indeed\\nperhaps the Venetians were of the same teint one day. In the\\nLibrary of San Marco is a parchment of C\\u00e6sar Vecelli, a Cousin of\\nTitian, coming from the collections of the patrician Nani. It describes\\nhow there were built at Venice many house tops with sun parlours or\\n terrazi . To these terrazi the women of the city of the Doges, who\\nwould bleach their hair by natural means, would repair and let the sun\\ndo its work.\\n\\nCasanova, too, remarked the feminine beauties of the Queen of the\\nAdriatic. He said of one of them: \\\"I am content indeed to find so\\nbeautiful a creature. I do not conceive how so ravishing a creature\\ncould have lived so long in Venice without having married ere now.\\\"\\n\\nAs night draws down, the scene at Venice changes manifestly from what it\\nwas in the garish sunlight of day. It becomes softer and more fairylike.\\nAcross the Piazzetta the rosy flush still glints from the tower of the\\nisland San Giorgio, though in the immediate neighbourhood day has\\npractically blackened into night. A sunset gun sounds from seaward and\\nhere and there lights twinkle out when, in the magic of a very short\\ntwilight, another scene is set, a more wonderful, more fairylike scene\\nthan before, with a coming and going of firefly gondolas and boats, a\\nstreaming of arcs and incandescents on shore, and in the midst of it\\nall a brass band arrives in front of San Marco and begins to bray\\nragtime waltzes and serenades. The note may be a false one, but it\\nreiterates the fact that one may sit before his table at Florian's all\\nthrough the livelong day and night and see and hear the whole gamut of\\njoyousness played as it is nowhere else. The townfolk, the strangers\\nfrom the hotels, and sailor folk from the Lido and the Guiadecca all\\nmingle in a seemingly inextricable maze. These last are the most\\npicturesque note as to costuming and colouring in all Venice to-day.\\n\\nThe fishermen of the Guiadecca, swarthy hued and scarlet-capped, and\\nwith heavy hoops of gold hanging from their ears, stroll about the\\npiazza as is their right, mingling with tourists and the \\\"real\\nVenetians.\\\" All move about in lively measure like an operatic chorus,\\nbut with a much more graceful and less conscious gait.\\n\\nNight on the Piazza or the Piazzetta is not the least of Venice's\\ncharms.\\n\\nThe background hills bordering upon the Venetian plain are a very\\ninteresting corner of northern Italy. Throughout this region souvenirs\\nare not wanting of the glorious days of the Venetian Republic.\\n\\nFor her own protection Venice conquered the surrounding mainland as she\\nwas laying the foundations of the island metropolis. Treviso fell to her\\npermanently in 1339, and Udine in 1420, as did later many other towns to\\nthe south. From this time forth the lion of San Marco reared its head\\nfrom its pedestal in the market place of each of these allied towns.\\nSome five thousand square miles of Dalmatia came to Venice at this time\\nand thenceforth her position was assured. Venice was occupied by the\\nFrench in 1797 when Napoleon overthrew the Republic. It was the first\\ntime the city had ever been occupied by an enemy. It was given to\\nAustria by a succeeding treaty, but later in 1805 was made over\\ndefinitely to Italy.\\n\\nTreviso, on the highroad from Venice to Vienna, is a great overgrown\\nburg which lives chiefly in the historic past of the days when first it\\nbecame a bishop's see and was known as Trovisium, the capital of the\\nprovince of the same name.\\n\\nA story is current of Treviso that once the people, to celebrate one of\\nthe infrequent intervals of peace, had summoned all the neighbouring\\npopulations to a splendid festival. Among other amusements they had\\nprovided a mimic castle of wood, adorned in the most sumptuous manner.\\nWithin this castle were stationed the twelve most beautiful ladies of\\nPadua, with their attendant maidens, loaded down with all kinds of\\nflowers and fruits. The chosen youths of the neighbouring cities\\nadvanced in bands to attack the fortress defended by such a garrison.\\nThe ladies made a long and vigorous defence. But finally a band of\\nVenetians pressed forward through the rain of projectiles, breached the\\nwalls, and planted on them the banner of San Marco. The youth of Padua,\\ninflamed at this sight, pressed forward in turn to force their way\\ninside the fortifications. The two bands were crushed together in the\\nbreach; angry words arose; from words both parties came to blows; the\\nPaduans proved the stronger and in the struggle seized on the banner of\\nSan Marco and tore it to shreds. With difficulty the Trevisans restored\\norder and drove both parties out of the town. The Venetians flew to arms\\nto demand satisfaction for the outrage to their flag. The Government of\\nPadua refused it. Hence a war between the two cities, in which the\\nPaduans were worsted.\\n\\nFrom Treviso to Belluno, and thence by the Ampesso Pass, is one of the\\ngateways leading from the Italian plain into Austria. Feltre, en route,\\nhas a fine old \\\"Rocca,\\\" or castle, with a square donjon tower.\\n\\nEn route to Belluno one should, if he comes this way at all, branch off\\nto Asolo. Among the many hundreds of visitors to Venice who formerly\\nclimbed to the top of the Campanile of San Marco in order to enjoy the\\nwonderful panorama of the Venetian plain and mountains which it affords,\\nfew, probably, recall the distant little city of Asolo which the guide\\npointed out to them, unless, indeed, they happen to be familiar with\\nRobert Browning's poems, in which case they will, perhaps, wish to make\\na pilgrimage out into these background hills the poet loved so well: \\\"My\\nAsolo,\\\" as he called it in the introduction to the last volume of his\\npoems, \\\"Asolando,\\\" written during his stay there in 1889. A trip among\\nthe Asolan Hills will well repay not only the lover of poetry, but also\\nthe artist and the ordinary traveller with a liking for quiet,\\npicturesque spots off the ordinary beaten track.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Albergo Asolo, in the main street, offers clean and characteristic\\naccommodation with charges to correspond. One turns off to Asolo from\\nCornuda, a station on the Belluno line, or by road from the same place.\\nThe imposing ruined Rocca is well worthy of a visit for the sake of\\nthe extensive view obtainable from the hill on which it stands. On a\\nclear day the towers of Venice can be seen without a glass, and on every\\nside the view is remarkably fine. To the north, beyond the nearer range\\nof mountains, are visible several peaks in the Primiero group of\\nDolomites -- the Sasso del Mur, Sagron, and others. Another good point of\\nview is the belfry tower of the old Castello which was the residence of\\nQueen Cornaro, the deposed Queen of Cyprus, whose gay court made the\\nname of Asolo famous at the end of the fifteenth century.\\n\\nFrom Treviso the road to Udine passes Conegliano, with a fine castle of\\nimposing proportions and a Triumphal Arch erected in the nineteenth\\ncentury to the Emperor of Austria.\\n\\nPordenone, ten kilometres farther on, is the old Portus Naonis of the\\nRomans. This is almost its sole claim to fame, except that \\\"Il\\nPordenone,\\\" a celebrated fifteenth century artist, was born here.\\n\\nCodroipo, actually a place of no importance to-day, takes its name from\\nthe crossing of two celebrated Roman roads of antiquity. Codroipo, by a\\nvague etymological sequence, is supposed to have the same meaning as\\ncarrefour in French, i.e. quadrivium .\\n\\nAt Campo Formico, just before Udine is reached, Bonaparte and the\\nEmperor of Austria signed the treaty, in October, 1797, by which Venice\\nwas so shamefully sacrificed by the French general to Austria. It was\\none of the deepest blots in the political history of Napoleon. The mean\\nhouse in which this disastrous treaty was concluded is still pointed\\nout.\\n\\nIt was in the Villa Passarino, near Udine, that this infamous treaty saw\\nthe light. Its gardens to-day are of the mixed formal and landscape\\nvariety, and great renown belongs to it because of the prominence of the\\nManins, its early owners. Borghetti restored the fabric in 1763, and it\\nremains to-day a far more satisfactory structure to look at than many\\nwhich are architecturally entitled to rank on a higher plane. Cypress\\nand oak form the greater part of the verdure of the gardens.\\n\\nUdine, of the picturesque name, is a city of twenty thousand\\ninhabitants, once the capital of Friuli, and still surrounded by its\\nancient walls. In the centre is the castle, now a prison, built in 1517\\nby Giovanni Fontana on the height chosen by Attila to view the burning\\nof Aquileja. Udine presents many features of resemblance in its\\nbuildings to the mother city, to whose rule it was so long subjected:\\nit has its grand square, its Palazzo Publico, (1457) -- a fine Gothic\\nbuilding on pointed arches instead of the Doge's palace -- the two\\ncolumns, the winged lion of San Marco, and a campanile with two figures\\nto strike the hours. Udine is indeed a little Venice, all but the canals\\nand quays and the Adriatic's waves.\\n\\nSouth of Udine, on the marshy shore of the same series of lagoons which\\nsurround Venice itself, is Aquileja. Aquileja was in ancient times one\\nof the most important provincial cities of Rome, and one of the chief\\nbulwarks of Italy. Augustus often resided here, and its population was\\nthen estimated at 100,000. It was taken by Attila in 452, and reduced to\\nashes by that ferocious barbarian. It contains at present about 1,500\\ninhabitants, and even they have a hard time clinging to the shreds of\\nlife left them by a climate that is pestilential and damp.\\n\\nFrom Venice and Treviso the Strada di Grande Communicazione runs to\\nVicenza and Verona, the former 63 kilometres from Treviso and the latter\\n50 kilometres farther on. At Vicenza the highroad is joined by another\\ntrunk-line from Padua, 32 kilometres to the southwest. All of these\\nroads are practically flat and are good roads in good weather and bad\\nroads -- O! how bad! -- in bad weather.\\n\\n \\n\\nFew strangers stop off at Vicenza, on the line from Verona to Venice.\\nVicenza, then, is not lettered large in the guide books, and has only\\nappeared of late in the public prints because of being the home of the\\nromancer, Antonio Fogazzora. This makes it a literary shrine at all\\nevents, so we stopped to look it over. It was more than this; we first\\nsaw Vicenza by moonlight, and its silhouettes and shadows were as grimly\\nancient as if seen in a dream. Daylight discovered other charms. There\\nwere warm, lovable old Renaissance house fronts everywhere, with\\noverhanging tiled roofs and advanced grilled balconies; and there was\\nthe Piazza dei Signori and its surrounding houses, almost entirely the\\nwork of the architect Palladio.\\n\\nThe Municipio itself was not a dead, dull thing in drab stone, but with\\na warm red tower, brought entire, it is said, from Venice, along with\\ntwo columns of the fa\\u00e7ade which are borne aloft on two sculptured lions.\\n\\nVicenza, the neglected tourist point, was offering much, and we were\\nglad we came.\\n\\nVicenza, more than any other of the little frequented tourist cities of\\nItaly, may be counted as the city of palaces. They are of two\\nnon-contemporary styles, the Venetian semi-gothic of a good era, and\\nPalladio's classical copies, also good of their kind, particularly so\\nwhen seen here in their natural environment.\\n\\nIn the Corso is a curious monumental structure called the Casa di\\nPalladio, built it is said by the great architect for his own use. He\\nhad need for it as his work here was great and long in completion. It\\nis something more than a mere architect's office or bureau; it is in\\nfact a palace.\\n\\nOne of the most curious buildings in the city, and certainly one of the\\nmost remarkable with which the name of Palladio is connected, is the\\nTeatro Olimpico. Contrary to the architect's manner of working, the\\nedifice has no fa\\u00e7ade, being entirely surrounded by houses. It was begun\\nin 1580, but in consequence of his death almost immediately afterwards\\nit was completed by his son, Scilla.\\n\\nThe scenery, which is fixed, represents the side of a species of piazza,\\nfrom which diverge streets of real elevation, but diminishing in size as\\nthey recede in the perspective. A great effect of distance is obtained,\\nespecially in the middle avenue. Daylight, however, by which a traveller\\nusually sees it, is injurious to the effect.\\n\\nPalladio's architectural ideas went abroad even to England and many a\\n\\\"stately home\\\" in Britain to-day is a more or less faithful copy of a\\nVicenza sixteenth century palazzo.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Rotonda Capra, now in ruins, so well known as Palladio's villa, was\\ncopied by Lord Burlington and planted squat down on the banks of the\\nThames at Chiswick. It loses considerably by transportation; it were\\ndecidedly more effective at the base of Monte Berico in Venezia.\\n\\nPalladio himself is buried in the local Campo Santo. His grave should\\nbecome an art lover's shrine, but no one has ever been known to worship\\nat it.\\n\\nBetween Vicenza and Verona runs a charming highway, strewn with villas\\nof a highly interesting if not superlatively grand architectural order.\\n\\nA dozen or fifteen kilometres from Vicenza are the two castles of\\nMontecchio, the strongholds of the family of the name celebrated by\\nShakespere as one of the rivals of the Capulets.\\n\\nAt the Bridge of Arcole is an obelisk in commemoration of the battle\\nwhen Napoleon went against the Austrians after his check at Caldiero.\\n\\nSoave, a little further on, is an old walled town as medi\\u00e6val in its\\nlooks and doings as it was when its great gates and towers and its\\ncastle fortress on the height were built six centuries ago.\\n\\nVerona is reached in thirty kilometres and has a sentimental, romantic\\ninterest beyond that possessed by any of the secondary cities of Italy.\\nIt has not the great wealth of notable architectural splendours of many\\nother places, but what there is is superlatively grand, the structures\\nsurrounding the Piazza Erbe and the Piazza dei Signori, for instance;\\nthe old Ponte di Castel Vecchio; the great Roman Arena; and even the\\nAlbergo all'Accademia, where one is remarkably well cared for in a fine\\nold medi\\u00e6val palace with a monumental gateway, and an iron and carved\\nstone well in the courtyard.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe glory and sentiment which overshadowed the Verona of another day\\nhave passed, and now the noise of electric trams and the hoot of\\nautomobile horns awaken the echoes in the same thoroughfares where one\\nday trampled the feet of warring hosts.\\n\\n \\\"The glory of the Scaliger has passed,\\n The Capuletti and Montague are naught:\\\"\\n\\nInstead we have the modern note sounding over all, and, if it is true\\nthat the \\\"fair Juliet sleeps in old Verona's town\\\" hers must be a\\ndisturbed sleep. The romance of Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague was\\nreal enough; that is, there was a real romance of the sort, and there\\nwere real Capulets and Montagues. Just where the scene of this\\nparticular romance was laid one is not so sure.\\n\\nThe \\\"House of Juliet\\\" at Verona, one of the stock sights of the guide\\nbooks, is of more than doubtful authenticity. Certainly, to begin with,\\nit does not comport in the least with the dignified marble palace and\\nits halls with which the stage-carpenter has built up the settings of\\nShakespere's drama or Gounod's opera. Perhaps they embroidered too much.\\nOf course they did!\\n\\nIn 1905 the \\\"Juliet House\\\" was in danger of collapsing. As it is\\nnothing more than a picturesque old house, such as northern Italy\\nabounds in, perhaps it would not have mattered much had it fallen. It is\\nno more Juliet's house than Juliet's tomb is the tomb of Juliet. This\\nindeed has latterly been adjudged a mere water-trough. No house, it is\\nasserted, in Verona to-day can be declared with certainty as the house\\nof a Montague or a Capulet. Henry James points the moral of all this in\\n\\\"The Custodians,\\\" and whether we can always make head and tail out of\\nhis dialogues or not, his judgments are always sound.\\n\\nIn Verona the very gutters are of white marble. Balustrades,\\nwindow-sills and hitching posts are all of white or coloured marbles.\\nVerona is luxurious, if not magnificent, and its architecture is\\nmarvellously interesting and beautiful, though frequently rising to no\\ngreat rank.\\n\\nThe great Roman Arena, so admirably preserved, is surrounded by the\\nPiazza Vittorio Emanuele. The contrast between yesterday and to-day at\\nVerona is everywhere to be remarked. Its old Arena and the Visconti\\ngateway seen by moonlight look as ancient as anything on earth, but the\\ncaf\\u00e9s with their tables set out right across the Piazza, with a band\\nplaying on a temporary platform, set up on trestles in the middle, and\\nelectric trams swishing around the corner, are as modern as Earl's Court\\nor Coney Island, without however many of their drawbacks.\\n\\nVerona is a city of marble and coloured stone, of terraces and cypresses\\nand all the Italian accessories which stagecraft has borrowed for its\\nShakesperean settings. The cypresses planted around the outskirts of\\nVerona are said to be the oldest in Europe, but that is doubtful. They\\nare, some of them, perhaps four hundred years old, but on the shores of\\nthe Etang de Berre, in old Provence, is a group of these same trees,\\nless lean, greater of girth and denser of foliage. Surely these must\\nhave five hundred years to their credit according to Verona standards.\\n\\nVerona is one of the cities of celebrated art where the authorities\\ncontrol one's desire to dig about with a view to discovering buried\\nantiquities, even in one's own cellar or garden; much less may one sell\\nan old chimney pot or urn.\\n\\nRecently a Signor and Signora Castello, who owned an ancient house in\\nVia del Seminario, sold the magnificent red marble portals and two\\nbalconies without permission from the Government. They were fined two\\nthousand five hundred lire each, and ordered to replace the objects of\\nart.\\n\\nAfter a long chase the Verona police discovered the articles in a\\nwarehouse where they had been temporarily deposited previous to shipping\\nthem abroad.\\n\\nThe balconies are of the same epoch as the famous one said to have been\\nthe scene of the meeting of Romeo and Juliet. \\\"American collectors keep\\noff\\\" is the sign the Verona police would probably put up if they dared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nTHROUGH ITALIAN LAKELAND\\n\\n\\nThe lake region of the north is perhaps the most romantic in all Italy;\\ncertainly its memories have much appeal to the sentimentally inclined.\\nIndeed the tourists are so passionately fond of the Italian lakeland\\nthat they leave it no \\\"close\\\" season, but are everywhere to be remarked,\\nfrom Peschiera on the east to Orta on the west. Seemingly they are all\\nhoneymoon couples and seek seclusion, and are therefore less offensive\\nthan the general run of conducted parties which now \\\"do\\\" the Italian\\nround for a ten pound note from London, or the same thing from New York\\nfor a couple of hundred dollars.\\n\\nIt is the fashion to revile the automobilist as a hurried traveller, but\\nhe at least gets a sniff of the countryside en route which the others do\\nnot.\\n\\nComing from the east through Verona, the traveller by road might do\\nworse than make a detour of a hundred kilometres out and back to\\nMantua.\\n\\nMantua, on the banks of the Mincio, sits like a water-surrounded town of\\nthe Low Countries. Mantua, above all, is a place of war, one of the\\nstrongest in North Italy, forming with Verona, Legnago and Peschiera the\\nfamous \\\"Quadrilatera.\\\" Mantua has at least a tenth part of its\\npopulation made up of Jews. It sits partly surrounded by an artificial\\nlake formed by the Mincio, and the marsh land to the south can be\\nflooded, if it is deemed advisable, in case of siege. A great walled\\nenclosure, a series of fortified dykes, and a collection of detached\\nforts roundabout, put Mantua in a class quite by itself. It is a\\nmelancholy, unlovely place from an \\u00e6sthetic standpoint, but picturesque\\nin a certain crude way. The ancient Palazzo Gonzague of the Dukes of\\nMantua, now known as the Corte Reale, is one of the most ambitious\\nedifices of its class in Italy. The view of the Palazzo Ducale at\\nMantua, with the rising background of roofs, towers and domes, as seen\\nfrom the further end of the cobble-stone paved bridge over the Mincio,\\nis delightful. Artists do not like it as a general rule because of the\\nugly straight line of the bridge, and the \\\"camera fiend\\\" makes a\\nhopeless mess of it, unless he seeks an hour or more for a \\\"point of\\nview;\\\" but for all that the scene is as quaint and beautiful a\\ncomposition as one can get of unspoiled medi\\u00e6valism in these progressive\\ntimes, when usually telegraph poles and tram cars project themselves\\ninto focus whether or no. There is nothing of the kind here.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe road from Mantua to Cremona, following the banks of the Mincio,\\nstill preserves its Virgilian aspect. Mantua v\\u00e6 miser\\u00e6 nimium vicina\\nCremon\\u00e6. From this one infers that it is a bad road, and in truth it is\\nvery bad; automobilists will not like it. Cremona's tower is seen from\\nafar, like the sailors' beacon from the sea. It is one of the most hardy\\nand the most renowned Gothic towers of Italy and has a height\\napproximating a hundred and twenty odd metres, say a little less than\\nfour hundred feet.\\n\\nNeighbouring upon this great Torrazo is the Palazzo Gonfaloneri, dating\\nfrom 1292. These two monuments, together with the magnificent Romanesque\\nLombard Cathedral of the twelfth century, and the Casa Stradivari -- where\\nhe who gave his name to a violin lived -- are Mantua's chief \\\"things to\\nsee.\\\" If the traveller can include Mantua in his itinerary, which truth\\nto tell is not easy without doubling on one's tracks, he should do so.\\n\\nTravellers coming westward from Venice and passing Verona, hastening to\\nthe Italian and Swiss lakes, usually give that region lying between\\nVerona and Como little heed. Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice and then\\nSwitzerland and the Rhine is still too often the itinerary of hurried\\npapas and fond mamas. Even if the automobilist does not drop down on\\nMantua and Cremona he should take things leisurely through the lake\\nregion and stop en route as often as fancy wills. The Lago di Garda is\\nthe most easterly of the Italian Lakes and the largest.\\n\\nIt is of great depth, 350 metres or more, is sixty odd kilometres in\\nlength, and in places a third as wide. It is a product of the rivers and\\ntorrents flowing down from the mountains of the Italian Tyrol. The\\nsudden storms which frequently come up to ruffle its bosom were\\ncelebrated by some lines of Virgil and his example has been followed by\\nevery other traveller ever caught in one of these storms. \\\" Fluctibus et\\nfremitu assurgens \\\" sang the bard, and the words still echo down through\\ntime.\\n\\nPeschiera and Desenzano are the principal ports at the southern end of\\nthe lake, and each in its way is trying to be a \\\"resort.\\\" The environs\\nare charming and the towns themselves interesting enough, though chiefly\\nfrom the point of view of the artist. The seeker after the gaieties and\\npleasures of the great watering places will find nothing of the sort\\nhere.\\n\\nBetween Peschiera and Desenzano juts out the promontory of Sermione. A\\nvillage is entered by a drawbridge and a medi\\u00e6val gate on the south. On\\nthe opposite side is a fortified wall that separates it from the\\nnortherly portion of the island, and through which opens the only gate\\nin that direction. The old castle, in the form of a quadrangle, with a\\nhigh square tower, was entered on the north by a drawbridge. This\\nentrance is still well preserved, as well as its small port or\\n darsena , surrounded by crenelated battlements; but the principal\\nentrance is now on the side of the village, by a gate over which are\\nshields bearing the arms of the Scaligers. It is one of the most\\nimposingly militant of all the castles of north Italy. Only that of\\nF\\u00e9nis in the Val d'Aoste is more so.\\n\\nRiva, at the Austrian end of the lake of Garda, has its drawbacks but it\\noccupies a wonderful site nevertheless.\\n\\nWhile Northern Tyrol is still wrapped in the white mantle of winter's\\nsnow, and winter sports of every description furnish great amusement for\\nold and young, the lovely Lake of Garda is already beginning to show\\nsigns of spring. All along the lake the great \\\" stanzoni ,\\\" or\\nlemon-houses for sheltering the lemon trees in winter, are, even in\\nJanuary, often filled with blossoms.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe best time to visit Riva is from February to June, and from the\\nmiddle of August to the end of October, but Riva at all times will be a\\nsurprise and a delight to those who do not mind a r\\u00e9gime table d'h\\u00f4te,\\nas the doctors have it, and the fact that everybody round about appears\\nto be a semi-invalid.\\n\\nTo Brescia from the foot of the Lake of Garda is a matter of twenty odd\\nkilometres, through a greatly varied nearby landscape, set off here and\\nthere by vistas of the azure of the distant lake, the Alps of Tyrol and\\nthe nearer Bergamese mountains.\\n\\n\\\" Bologna la Grassa \\\" and \\\" Brescia Armata \\\" are two nick-names by which\\nthe respective cities are known up and down Italy. Brescia, like most\\nItalian towns, is built on a hill top and is castle-crowned as becomes a\\nmedi\\u00e6val burg. Brescia's castle is an exceptionally strongly fortified\\nfeudal monument. Brescia Armata took its name from the fact that it\\nwas ever armed against its enemies, which in the good old days every\\nItalian city was or it was of no account whatever. Brescia's enemies\\ncould never have made much headway when attacking this hill-top\\nfortress, and must have contented themselves with sacking the cities of\\nthe surrounding plain. To-day firearms in great quantities are made\\nhere, and thus the city is still entitled to be called Brescia\\nArmata .\\n\\nBrescia's market place is more thickly covered with great, squat,\\nmushroom umbrellas than that of any other city of its size in Italy.\\n\\nBrescia is dear to the French because of its wraith of a medi\\u00e6val\\ncastle, once so vigorously defended by the Chevalier Bayard, that famous\\nknight sans peur et sans reproche .\\n\\nA bastioned wall surrounds the gay little Lombard city in the genuine\\nromance fashion, albeit there is to-day very little romance in Brescia,\\nwhich lives mostly by the exploitation of its textile and metal\\nindustries.\\n\\nBrescia housefronts are as gaily decorated as those of Nuremberg, many\\nof them at least. It is a remarkable feature of Brescia's domestic\\narchitecture.\\n\\nThe castle or citadel itself was built by the Viscontis in the\\nfourteenth century on the summit of a hill overlooking the town. The\\nVenetians strengthened it and again the Austrians. General Haynau\\nbombarded the low-lying city round about in barbarous fashion, so much\\nso that the memory of it caused him to be chased from London some years\\nlater, when he was sent there as Ambassador.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe men of Brescia seem to have a passion for wearing a great Capucin\\nshoulder cloak, which looks very Spanish. It is most picturesque, and is\\none of the characteristic things seen in all Brescia's public places,\\n caff\\u00e9s and restaurants, and is worn by all those classes whom a\\ndiscerning traveller once described as men who work hard at doing\\nnothing, for Brescia's street corners are never vacant and her caff\\u00e9s \\nnever empty.\\n\\nBetween Brescia and Bergamo is the Lake of Iseo; the fourth in size of\\nthe north Italian lakes. The vegetation of its shores is purely Italian\\nand vineyards and olive groves abound. A fringe of old castle towers, of\\nwalls, palaces and villas surround it, all blended together with a\\nhistoric web and woof of medi\\u00e6valism and romance.\\n\\nFrom Brescia to Bergamo runs one of the best national highroads in\\nItaly. The automobilist will appreciate this and will want to push on to\\nthe end. He would do better to break it midway and drop down on the road\\nto Martinengo, a detour of twenty kilometres only, passing the great\\nCastle of Malpaga built by the celebrated Bartolommeo Colleoni, an\\nedifice which gives a more complete idea of unspoiled, unrestored\\nresidence of a medi\\u00e6val Italian nobleman than any other extant.\\n\\nBergamo is a strange combination of the new and the old. The upper and\\nlower towns -- for it is built on a rise of the Bergamon Alps -- have\\nnothing in common with each other. In the lower town there are great\\nhotels, shops, and even a vast factory which turns out a celebrated make\\nof automobiles. In the upper town there are market-men and women, with\\nchickens, vegetables and fruit to sell, all spread out under an imposing\\narray of great mushroom umbrellas only second to those of the market\\nplace at Brescia.\\n\\nBergamo's chief architectural monuments are its churches, but its\\nancient Broletto, or castle, of not very pure Gothic, but with a most\\noriginal fa\\u00e7ade, is worth them all put together in its appeal to one\\nwith an eye for the picturesque. Its tower is a remarkably firm, solid\\nand yet withal graceful sentinel of dignity and power.\\n\\n \\n\\nBergamo's great fair of Saint Alexander, held every year in August, was\\nonce the rival of those great trading fairs of Leipzig and Beaucaire. Of\\nlate it is of less importance, but holds somewhat to its ancient\\ntraditions. Certainly it filled the Albergo Capello d'Oro to such an\\nextent that it was doubtful for a time if we could find a place. A sight\\nof our mud-covered automobile and of our generally bedraggled\\nappearance -- for it had rained again, though that of itself is nothing\\nremarkable in Italy, and we had \\\"mud-larked it\\\" for the last fifty\\nkilometres, -- caused somebody's conscience to smite him and find us\\nshelter.\\n\\n \\n\\nBeyond Bergamo one enters the classic Italian Lake region, that which\\nhas usually been seen through a honeymoon perspective, a honeymoon that\\nis long-lasting, as it invariably is in Italy as some of us know. All\\nthrough this lakeland of north Italy is an unbroken succession of charms\\nwhich certainly, from the sentimental and romantic point, has no equal\\nin Italy, or out of it in the same area.\\n\\nThe whole battery of little cities, towns, and townlets which surround\\nLakes Como, Varese, Lugano and Maggiore are delightful from all points.\\nTheirs is a unique variety of charm which comports with the tranquil\\nmood, not at all the same as that possessed by the average scorching\\nautomobilist who reads as he runs, and wishes to eat and drink and\\nabsorb his romantic and historic lore in the same up-to-date fashion.\\nNot that the region is unsuited to automobile travel. Not at all, the\\nroads thereabouts are quite the best in Italy, and the towns themselves\\npicturesquely charming, if often lacking in ruined monuments of\\nmedi\\u00e6valism of the first rank. All of it is historic ground, and filled\\nwith echoes of fact and fancy which still reverberate from its hills and\\nthrough its vales.\\n\\nNot all of these lake-side towns can be catalogued here, no more than\\nare all included in the average itinerary, but from Lecco, at the\\nsouthern end of the Lecco arm of the Lago di Como, to Orta on the Lago\\nd'Orta will be found myriads of scenic surprises, dotted here and there\\nwith quaint waterside towns, the lakes themselves being punctuated with\\ngreat white winged barques, with here and there the not unpicturesque\\ncoil of smoke belching into the clear sky from a cranky, fussy little\\nsteamboat.\\n\\nOne most often approaches the lake district from the east, via Lecco on\\nthe eastern arm of Lake Como, or as it is locally called the Lago di\\nLecco. Lecco itself is of no importance. Its site is its all-in-all, but\\nthat is delightful. Between Lecco and Milan the highway crosses the Adda\\nby a magnificent bridge of ten arches built by Azzo Visconti in 1335.\\nVery few of the works of the old bridge-builders bear so ancient a date\\nas this. From Lecco to Monza the highroad skirts the Brianza, as the\\nlast Alpine foot-hills are called before the mountains flatten out into\\nthe Lombard Plain. At Arcore is the villa of the Adda family with a\\nmodern chapel.\\n\\nOne can go north from Lecco to Bellaggio by steamer, when he will arrive\\nin the very heart of lakeland, or he may go directly west by the\\nhighroad to Como and take his point of departure from there. The Lake of\\nComo was the Lacus Larius of the Romans and the Lari Maxime of Virgil.\\nIt is a hundred and ninety metres above sea level and among all other of\\nthe Swiss and Italian lakes holds the palm for the beauty of its\\nsurroundings.\\n\\nAt Nesso is the Villa Pliniana, built in 1570. It is not named for\\nPliny, but because of a nearby spring mentioned in his writings.\\nPliny's villa was actually at Lenno, in a dull gloomy site and he\\nproperly enough called the villa Tragedia.\\n\\nComo, the city, is ancient, for the younger Pliny, who was born in the\\nancient municipium of Comum, asserts that it was then a \\\"flourishing\\nstate.\\\" It does not enter actively into history, however, after the fall\\nof the Roman Empire, until 1107, when it became an independent city. It\\nremained a republic for two centuries and then it fell under the\\ndominion of the Visconti since which time its fate has ever been bound\\nup with that of Milan.\\n\\nThe Broletto or municipal palace is curiously built of black and white\\nmarble courses, patched here and there with red. It is interesting, but\\nbizarre, and of no recognized architectural style save that it is a\\nreminder of the taste of the people of the Lombard Republics with\\nrespect to their civic architecture in the thirteenth century. Como's\\nDuomo is, on the contrary, a celebrated and remarkably beautiful\\nstructure. The distinction made between the taste in ecclesiastical and\\ncivic architecture of the time can but be remarked.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe military architecture of Como, as indicated by the gates in its old\\ncity wall, was of a high order. The Porta della Torre, the chief of\\nthe gates remaining, and leading out to the Milan road, rises five\\nstories in air.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Giovio is now the local museum. Paolo Giovio built the\\ncrudely ornate edifice, and began the collection of antiquities and\\nrelics which it now contains. Above Como, but outside the city, rises a\\ncurious lofty tower called the Bardello. It may have been built as one\\nof the defences of the Lombard Kings, or it may not, but at any rate\\nthere is no doubt that it witnessed the rise and fall of the Milanese\\ndynasties from the first. Como, one of the first cities to assert its\\nindependence, was the first to lose it. Prisoners of state were put into\\niron cages and stowed away in the Bardello -- like animals or birds in a\\nlive stock show. They were all tagged and numbered and were fed at\\ninfrequent, uncertain hours. Not many lived out their terms; mostly they\\ndied, some of hunger, some eaten up by vermin and more than one by\\nhaving dashed their brains out on the iron bars of their cages.\\n\\nAll about Como are little lake settlements peopled with villas and\\nhotels where many a medi\\u00e6val and modern romance has been lived in the\\nreal. It is all very delightful, but in truth all is stagey.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt Cadenabbia is the Villa Carlotta, named for Charlotte the Duchess of\\nSaxe-Meiningen. Its structural elements build up into something\\nimposing, if not in the best of taste, and its gardens are of the\\nconventionally artificial kind which look as though they might be part\\nof a stage setting.\\n\\nBellaggio, on the eastern shore of the lake, is a place of large hotels,\\nno history of remark, and the site of the villa Serbelloni, with which\\nthe proprietor of one of the hotels seems to have some special\\narrangement, in that he passes visitors to and fro from his\\nestablishment to the villa in genuine showman fashion. Beyond its site,\\nwhich is entrancingly lovely, it has no appeal whatever from either the\\narchitectural or the landscape gardening point of view.\\n\\nMennagio, Belluno and Varenna are in the same category and are tourist\\nshow places only. Gravadona is different in that it has two remarkably\\nbeautiful churches, which can be omitted from no consideration of\\nItalian church architecture, and the Palazzo de Pero, built in 1586 for\\nCardinal Gallio which, with its four angle-towers, is more like a\\nfortress than a prelate's residence.\\n\\nNear Gravadona is the outline of an ancient highway known as the Strada\\nRegina. Supposedly it was made centuries and centuries ago by\\nTheodolinda, Queen of the Lombards, and must be one of the oldest roads\\nin existence.\\n\\nThe Lago di Lugano is the most irregular of all the Italian Lakes. In\\npart it lies in Lombardy and in part within the Swiss canton of Ticino.\\nIts scenery is quite distinct from that of the other Italian lakes, not\\nmore beautiful perhaps, but less prolifically surrounded by that\\nsub-tropical verdure which is characteristic of Garda and Como. In the\\nnortheasterly portion, around Porlezza, the precipitous outlines of the\\nmountains round about lend an almost savage aspect.\\n\\nLugano itself is very near the Swiss border but is thoroughly Italian,\\nwith deep arcaded streets, and here and there a Renaissance fa\\u00e7ade such\\nas can be found nowhere out of Italy.\\n\\nThe Lago di Varese is the smallest of all the lakes. In the\\nneighbourhood is produced a great deal of silk, and a species of easily\\nworked marble or alabaster called Marmo Majolica. Varese itself, while\\nnot destitute of monuments of architectural worth, is more noticeably a\\nplace of modern villas, most of which are occupied by wealthy Milanese.\\n\\n \\n\\nFrom Varese to Laveno on the Lago di Maggiore is a matter of fifty\\nkilometres, and here one comes to the most famous, if not the most\\nbeautiful, of all the lakes.\\n\\nThe whole range of towns circling this daintily environed lake have an\\nalmost inexpressible charm, and its islands -- the Borromean Islands -- are\\nsuperlatively beautiful.\\n\\nBaveno, on the mainland, and its villas, modern though they are, is a\\ncharming place, and Stresa, a little further to the south, is even more\\ndelightfully disposed. All about the Italian lakeland are the modern\\nvilla residences of distinguished Milanese, Turinese and Genoese\\nfamilies.\\n\\nArona is at the southern end of the lake. Above this town is a colossal\\nstatue of San Carlo Borromeo, the head, hands and feet being cast in\\nbronze, the remainder being fabricated of beaten copper.\\n\\nThe famous Borromean Islands in the Lago di Maggiore number four: Isola\\nBella, Isola Madre, Isola San Giovanni and Isola dei Piscatori, of which\\nthe three former belong to the Borromean family, whilst the latter is\\ndivided among small proprietors.\\n\\nThe vast Palazzo of Isola Bella was a conception of an ancestor of the\\npresent family in 1671. The great fabric, with its terraces, gardens and\\ngrottoes, is an exotic thing of the first importance. It is idyllically\\npicturesque, but withal inartistic from many points of view. The\\ncontrast of all this semi-tropical luxuriousness with its snow-capped\\nAlpine background is not its least remarkable feature. It has been\\ncalled \\\"fairylike,\\\" \\\"a caprice of grandiose ideas,\\\" and \\\"enchanted,\\\" and\\nthese words describe it well enough. It looks unreal, as if one saw it\\nin a dream. Certainly its wonderful panoramic background and foreground\\nare not equalled elsewhere and no garden carpet of formal flowerbeds\\never made so beautifully disposed a platform on which to stand and\\nmarvel. The architect of it all made no allowance apparently for the\\nnatural setting, but overloaded his immediate foreground with all things\\nthat suggested themselves to his imaginative mind. Somehow or other he\\ndidn't spoil things as much as he might have done. The setting is\\ntheatrical and so are the accessories; all is splendidly spectacular,\\nand, since this is its classification, no one can cavil. What other\\neffect could be produced where ten staired terraces tumble down one on\\nanother in a veritable cascade simply as a decorative accessory to a\\nmonumental edifice and not as a thing of utility?\\n\\nOn Isola Madre is another vast structure surrounded by tropical and\\nsemi-tropical trees, flowers and shrubs. A chapel contains many of the\\ntombs of the Borromeo family.\\n\\nThe Isola dei Piscatori is the artists' paradise of these parts. It\\nlacks the \\\"prettiness\\\" of the other islands but gains in \\\"character\\\" as\\nartists call that picturesqueness which often is unsuspected and unseen\\nby the masses.\\n\\nGoing back to history, here is what happened once on the Isola Bella: It\\nis a warm June night. The mauve summits of the Simplon and the reflets \\nof the mirrored lake throw back a penetrating shimmer to the view.\\nComing from Baveno, and holding straight its course for Isola Bella, is\\na gently moving bark. It is the year 1800, and on the stern seat of the\\nboat sits the First Consul, who was once the Little Corporal and\\nafterwards became Napoleon I.\\n\\nThe French army had freed the Alps, some days before. Over the passes of\\nMont Cenis, of the Simplon, of Saint Bernard, and Saint Gothard they had\\ncome, soon to form in battle line on the plains of Piedmont. Moncey was\\nat the gates of Milan, Lannes held the passage of the Po. The First\\nConsul, arriving on the shores of the Lago di Maggiore, decided to pass\\nthe night in the Castle of Isola Bella, alone on this enchanting isle,\\nwith his thoughts and his plans. Bonaparte jumped first from the boat as\\nit grated on the sands and was received by a grotesquely attired\\nmajor-domo, in the name of the Counts of Borromeo, the sovereign princes\\nof this tiny archipelago.\\n\\nIn the seigneurial chamber, of which the furniture comprised a great\\nfour poster dating from the time of the Medicis, a massive round table,\\nits top laid in mosaic, some chairs and a terrestrial globe, Napoleon\\nshook off the dust of travel forthwith: but he did not seek repose. On\\nthe mosaic table-top Napoleon unfolded a great map of Italy, and with\\nforehead in his hands gazed attentively at its tracings, soliloquizing\\nthus: \\\"Yes, Italy is reconquered already; the Austrian army cannot\\nescape me. Fifteen days will suffice to efface the disasters of two\\nyears. The Austrian army is already in retreat; its rear guard has\\nbecome its advance guard. The tricolour of France will yet float on the\\nshores of the Adriatic. I shall march on Rome. I will chase the hateful\\nBourbons from the Kingdom of Naples for ever. Europe will tremble at the\\necho of my footsteps.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nFinally the twilight faded; back of the mountains of Lugano shone a\\nbrilliant star. Napoleon thought it his star of destiny. To the wide\\nopen window came the First Consul for a breath of the sweet night air.\\nIt acted like champagne. He turned back into the room; he kicked over\\nthe terrestrial globe of the Borromeo; he threw the map of Italy to the\\nfloor. \\\"What is Italy!\\\" he cried, \\\"a mere nothing! Bah! it's hardly\\nworth the conquering. Certainly not worth more than a few weeks. But I\\nwill leave the memory of my name behind. And then -- and then Saint Jean\\nd'Acre, the Orient, the Indies. Allons , we will follow the route of\\nTamerlane! Poland will come to life again, Moscow, St. Petersburg ...\\\"\\nand then he dreamed.\\n\\nAnd that is what passed one night in the Palazzo Borromeo a little more\\nthan a hundred years ago.\\n\\nFrom the shores of the Lago di Maggiore to Orta, on the lake of that\\nname, is a short dozen kilometres from either Arona or Baveno. At Orta\\nthe traveller may take his ease at an humble inn and from its broad\\nbalcony overhanging the lake enjoy emotions which he will not experience\\nat every halting place.\\n\\nOrta's Municipio, or Town hall, dominating its tiny Piazza is\\nunspeakably lovely though indeed it is a hybrid blend of the\\narchitecture of Germany and Italy. It might as well be in Nuremberg, in\\nBavaria or Barberino in Tuscany for all it looks like anything else in\\nPiedmont.\\n\\nOut in the lake glitters -- glitters is the word -- Isola San Giulio, its\\ngraceful campanile and ancient stone buildings hung with crimson\\ncreepers and mirrored in the clear blue depths. About this island there\\nhangs a legend. The story goes that no one could be found ready to ferry\\nthe apostle Julius across to the chosen site of his mission in the year\\n1500. According to popular rumour the isle was haunted by dragons and\\nvenomous reptiles that none dared face. Not to be deterred from his\\npurpose, the holy man spread his cloak upon the water, and floated\\nquickly and quietly across. Nor did the miracle end here, for, as with\\nSt. Patrick of Ireland, the unclean monsters, acknowledging his power,\\nretired to a far-away mountain, leaving the saint unmolested to carry on\\nhis labours, which were continued after his death by faithful friends.\\nThis is the story as it is told on the spot.\\n\\nThe island was held as an outpost against invasions for many years, and\\nfor long witnessed the hopeless struggles of a brave woman, Villa, wife\\nof King Berenger of Lombardy, who was besieged there by the Emperor Otho\\nthe Great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nMILAN AND THE PLAINS OF LOMBARDY\\n\\n\\nThe great artichoke of Lombardy, whose petals have fallen one by one\\nbefore its enemies of Piedmont, is now much circumscribed in area\\ncompared with its former estate.\\n\\nFrom Como to Mantua and from Brescia to Pavia, in short the district of\\nMilan as it is locally known to-day, is the only political entity which\\nhas been preserved intact. Tortona, Novara, Alessandria and Asti have\\nbecome alienated entirely, and for most travellers Milan is Lombardy and\\nLombardy is Milan. To-day the dividing line in the minds of most is\\ndecidedly vague.\\n\\nLombardy is the region of all Italy most prolific in signs of modernity\\nand prosperity, and, with Torino, Milan shares the honour of being the\\ncentre of automobilism in Italy. The roads here, take them all in all,\\nare of the best, though not always well conditioned. That from Milan to\\nComo can be very, very good and six months later degenerate into\\nsomething equally as bad. The roads of these parts have an enormous\\ntraffic over them and it is for this reason, as much as anything, that\\ntheir maintenance is difficult and variable. For the greater part they\\nare all at a general level, except of course in entering or leaving\\ncertain cities and towns of the hills and on the direct roads leading to\\nthe mountain passes back of Torino, or the roads crossing the lake\\nregion and entering Switzerland or the Oberland.\\n\\nLombardy in times past, and to-day to some extent, possessed a dialect\\nor patois quite distinct from the Franco-Italian m\\u00e9lange of Piedmont, or\\nthe pure Italian of Tuscany. The Lombard, more than all other dialects\\nof Italy, has a decided German flavour which, considering that the\\nLombard crown was worn by a German head, is not remarkable. In\\ntime -- after the Guelph-Ghibelline feud -- Lombardy was divided into many\\ndistinct camps which in turn became recognized principalities.\\n\\nThe Viscontis ruled the territory for the most part up to 1447, when the\\ncondotti\\u00e8re Francesco Sforza developed that despotism which brought\\ninfamy on his head and State, a condition of affairs which the Pope\\ndescribed as conducive to the greatest possible horrors.\\n\\n \\n\\nLombardy has ever been considered the real paradise and land of riches\\nof all Italy, and even now, in a certain luxuriousness of attitude\\ntowards life, it lives up to its repudiation of the days of the\\ndominating Visconti and Sforza.\\n\\nMilan is to-day the luxurious capital of Lombardy, as was Pavia in the\\npast. At one time, be it recalled, Milan was a Duchy in its own right.\\nYears of despotism at the hands of a man of genius made Milan a great\\ncity and the intellectual capital of Italy. Milanese art and\\narchitecture of the fifteenth century reached a great height. It was\\nthen, too, that the Milanese metal workers became celebrated, and it was\\na real distinction for a knight to be clad in the armour of Milan.\\n\\n \\\"Well was he armed from head to heel\\n In mail and plate of Milan steel.\\\"\\n\\nMilan has a history of the past, but paradoxically Milan is entirely\\nmodern, for it struggled to its death against Pavia, the city of five\\nhundred and twenty-five towers, and was born again as it now is. One\\nshould enter Milan in as happy a mood as did Evelyn who \\\"passynge by\\nLodi came to a grete citty famous for a cheese little short of the best\\nParmesan.\\\" It was a queer mood to have as one was coming under Milan's\\nspell, and the sculptured and Gothic glories of the Cathedral, as it\\nstands in completion to-day, are quite likely to add to, rather than\\ndetract from, any preconceived idea of the glories of the city and its\\ntreasures.\\n\\nMilan is one of the most princely cities of Europe, and lies in the\\ncentre of a region flowing with milk and honey. In Evelyn's time it had\\na hundred churches, seventy monasteries and forty thousand inhabitants.\\nTo-day its churches and monasteries are not so many, but it has a\\npopulation of half a million souls.\\n\\nThe comment of the usual tourist is invariably: \\\"There is so little to\\nsee in Milan.\\\" Well, perhaps so! It depends upon how hard you look for\\nit. Milan is a very progressive up-to-date sort of city, but its storied\\npast has been most momentous, and historic monuments are by no means\\nwanting. Milan is modern in its general aspect, it is true, and has\\nlittle for the unexpert in antiquarian lore, but all the same it has\\nthree magic lode stones; its luxuriously flamboyant Gothic Duomo; its\\nAmbrosian Library and its Palace of arts and sciences, La Brera.\\n\\nTourists may forget the two latter and what they contain, but they will\\nnot forget the former, nor the Arch of Triumph built as a guide post by\\nNapoleon on his march across Europe, or the Galleria Victor-Emmanuel,\\n\\\"as wide as a street and as tall as a Cathedral,\\\" a great arcade with\\nshops, caf\\u00e9s, restaurants and the like.\\n\\nThere is the Scala opera house, too, which ranks high among its kind.\\n\\nMilan's \\\"eighth wonder of the world,\\\" its great Cathedral, is the chef\\nd'oeuvre of the guide books. Details of its magnitude and splendours\\nare there duly set forth. Milan's Cathedral has long sheltered a dubious\\nstatue of St. Bartholomew, and tourists have so long raved over it that\\nthe authorities have caused to be graven on its base: \\\"I am not the work\\nof Praxiteles but of Marcus Agrates.\\\" Now the throngs cease to admire,\\nand late experts condemn the work utterly. Such is the follow-my-leader\\nidea in art likes and dislikes! And such is the ephemeral nature of an\\nartist's reputation!\\n\\nThe Palazzo Reale occupies the site of the Palazzo di Corte of the\\nVisconti and the Sforza of the fourteenth century, \\\"one of the finest\\npalaces of its time,\\\" it is recorded. The Palazzo of to-day is a poor,\\nmean thing architecturally, although the residence of the King to-day\\nwhen he visits Milan. The Archiepiscopal Palace of the sixteenth\\ncentury is perhaps the finest domestic establishment of its class and\\nepoch in Milan.\\n\\nMilan's Castello, the ancient castle of Milan, was the ancient ducal\\ncastle, built by Galeazzo Visconti II in 1358, to keep the Milanese in\\nsubjection. It was demolished after his death, but rebuilt with\\nincreased strength by Gian Galeazzo. On the death of the Duke Filippo\\nMaria, the Milanese rose (1447), and, having proclaimed the \\\"Aurea\\nrespublica Ambrosiana,\\\" destroyed the castle. It was rebuilt (1452) by\\nFrancesco Sforza, \\\"for the ornament (he said) of the city and its safety\\nagainst enemies.\\\" This building, completed in 1476, is the one now\\nstanding. In the interior is a keep, where the dukes often resided.\\nPhilip II added extensive modern fortifications, and caused to be pulled\\ndown all the neighbouring towers which overlooked them. The castle was\\ntaken by the French in 1796, and again in 1800, when Napoleon ordered\\nthe fortifications to be razed. It has since been converted into a\\nbarrack. Of the round towers at the angles, those towards the north have\\nbeen replaced by modern brick ones, while the two towards the city,\\nformed of massive granite blocks, remain. During the vice-royalty of\\nEugene Beauharnais, a Doric gateway of granite, with a portico, or\\nline of arches, now filled up, on each side, and in the same style, was\\nerected on the northwest side; between each arch is a medallion\\ncontaining the bas-relief portrait of some illustrious Italian military\\ncommander.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Napoleonic arch, the Arco della Pace, is a remarkably interesting\\ncivic monument, a reproduction of a temporary affair first built of wood\\nand canvas in 1806. Now it stands, a comparatively modern work to be\\nsure, but of splendid design and proportions, built of white marble, and\\nelaborately decorated with sculptures all at the expense of Napoleon,\\nwho, on his march of migratory conquest, deigned to devote 200,000\\nfrancs to the purpose.\\n\\nMilan's hotels are of all sorts and conditions, but with a decided\\ntendency towards the good, as is fitting in so opulent a country.\\nBertolini's Hotel Europe takes a high rank, at corresponding charges, as\\nfor instance four francs for a \\\"box\\\" for your automobile. The Touring\\nClub Italiano endorses the Albergo del Cervo, where you pay nothing for\\ngarage and may eat as bountifully as you will of things Italian, real\\nItalian, at from two to three francs a meal. One of the most amusing\\nthings to do in Milan is to lunch or dine in one of the great glass\\ncovered galleries near the cathedral, and one feasts well indeed for the\\nmatter of four francs, with another couple of francs for a bottle of\\nAsti. These great restaurants of the galleries may lack a certain aspect\\nof the next-to-the-soil Italian restaurants, but they do show a phase of\\nanother class of Italian life and here \\\"Young Italy\\\" may be seen taking\\nhis midday meal and ordering English or German beer or Scotch or\\nAmerican whiskey. He shuns the Italian items on the bill of fare and\\norders only exotics. You on the contrary will do the reverse.\\n\\nPavia, thirty odd kilometres south of Milan, was ever a rival of the\\ngreater city of to-day. Pavia is a tourist point, but only because it is\\non the direct road from Milan.\\n\\nPavia was the Lombard capital from 572 to 774. Its old walls and\\nramparts remain, in part, to-day and the whole aspect of the town is one\\nof a certain medi\\u00e6valism which comports little with the modernity of its\\nneighbour, Milan, which has so far outgrown its little brother.\\n\\nPavia's Certosa, on the road from Milan to Pavia, is its chief\\narchitectural splendour. Of that there is no doubt. It is the most\\ngorgeously endowed and most splendid monastery in all the world, founded\\nin 1396 by one of the Visconti as an atonement to his conscience for\\nhaving murdered his uncle and father-in-law.\\n\\nA Venetian, Bernardo da Venezia, was probably the architect of the\\nCertosa, and brick work and superimposed marble slabs and tablets all\\ncombine in an elegance which marks the Certosa of Pavia as\\ncharacteristic of the most distinctive Lombard manner of building of its\\nepoch.\\n\\nWithin the city itself still stands the grim Castello, built on the site\\nof the palace of the Lombard kings. The present building, however, was\\nbegun in 1460 and completed in 1469. It formed an ample quadrangle,\\nflanked by four towers, two of which alone remain. The inner court was\\nsurrounded by a double cloister, or loggia; in the upper one the arches\\nwere filled in by the most delicate tracery in brickwork. The whole was\\ncrowned by beautiful forked battlements. In the towers were deposited\\nthe treasures of literature and art which Gian Galeazzo had\\ncollected: -- ancient armour; upwards of 1,000 MSS., which Petrarch had\\nassisted in selecting; and many natural curiosities. All these Visconti\\ncollections were carried to France in 1499 by Louis XII and nothing was\\nleft but the bare walls. One side of the palace or castle was demolished\\nduring the siege by Lautrec in 1527; but in other respects it continued\\nperfect, though deserted, till 1796, when it was again put into a state\\nof defence by the French. They took off the roof and covered the\\nvaultings with earth; and when the rains came on in autumn, the weight\\nbroke down the vaultings, and ruined a great part of the edifice. It has\\nsince been fitted up as a military barracks. The great ruined gateway,\\nonce entered by a drawbridge crossing the fosse, is still the most\\nimposing single detail, and the great quadrangle, with its fourteenth\\ncentury arcades and windows, \\\"a medley of Gothic and Bramantesque,\\\" is\\nstriking, although the marble and terra-cotta ornaments are much\\ndilapidated.\\n\\nFran\\u00e7ois I's famous mot: \\\"all is lost save honour,\\\" uttered after the\\neventful battle of Pavia, will go down with that other remark of his:\\n\\\"Oh, God, but thou hast made me pay dear for my crown,\\\" as the two most\\napropos sayings of Renaissance times.\\n\\nOne has to look carefully \\\"under the walls of Pavia,\\\" to-day for any\\nhistorical evidence of the fatal day of Fran\\u00e7ois I when he lost his\\n\\\"all, save honour.\\\" Du Bellay has painted the picture so well that in\\nspite of the fact that four hundred years have rolled by, it seems\\nunlikely that even the most superficial traveller should not find some\\nhistoric stones upon which to build his suppositions.\\n\\nPavia's great University flowered in 1362, and owes much to the generous\\nimpulses of Galeas II, who founded its chairs of civic and canonical\\nlaw, medicine, physics and logic. Galeas II was a great educator, but he\\nwas versatile, for he invented a system of torture which would keep a\\npolitical prisoner alive for forty days and yet kill him at the end of\\nforty-one.\\n\\nIf one returns to Milan via the Bridge of Lodi he will have made a\\nhundred kilometre round of classic Lombard scenery. It possesses no\\nelements of topographic grandeur but is rich and prosperous looking, and\\nreplete with historic memory, every kilometre of it.\\n\\nLodi has evolved its name from the ancient Laus of the Romans, another\\nevidence of the oblique transformation of Latin into the modern dialect.\\nThe men of Lodi were ever rivals of the Milanese, but it is to\\nNapoleon's celebrated engagement at the Bridge of Lodi that it owes its\\nfame in the popular mind.\\n\\nAbove Lodi, the River Adda circles and boils away in a sort of whirlpool\\nrapid, which Leonardo da Vinci, setting his palette and brushes aside,\\nset about to control by a dam and a series of sluices. How well he\\nsucceeded may be imagined by recalling the fact that the Italian Edison\\nCompany in recent years availed themselves of the foundation of his plan\\nin their successful attempt to turn running water into electricity.\\n\\nThe panorama to the north of Milan is grandiose in every particular. On\\nthe horizon the Alpine chain lies clear-cut against the sky, the Viso,\\nGrand Paradise, Mont Blanc, Splugen and other peaks descending in one\\nslope after another, one foothill after another, until all opens out\\ninto the great plain of Lombardy.\\n\\nNorth of Milan, towards Como and the Alpine background, is Monza. Lady\\nMorgan called Monza dreary and silent, but her judgments were not always\\nsound; she depended too much upon moods and hers were many.\\n\\nMonza's Broletto was built by Frederick Barbarossa, or it was a part of\\na palace built by that monarch. Italian Gothic of an unmistakable local\\ncast is its style and the effect is heightened by the ringhiera \\nbetween the windows of the south side.\\n\\nIn Monza's Cathedral -- an antique interior with a Gothic exterior, by the\\nway -- is the celebrated Iron Crown of Lombardy with which the German\\nEmperors of Lombardy were crowned. Charles V, Napoleon and Ferdinand I\\nalso made use of the same historic bauble which is not of much\\nsplendour. It costs a five franc fee to see it, and the sight is not\\nworth the price of admission.\\n\\n \\n\\nFrom Milan to Domodossola, leaving Italy via the Simplon Pass, is 177\\nkilometres, or, via Bellinzona and the Splugen, 207 kilometres with\\nmediocre roads until the lake region is reached, when they improve\\ndecidedly, being of the very best as they ascend the mountain valleys.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nTURIN AND THE ALPINE GATEWAYS\\n\\n\\nThe mountains of Piedmont are of the same variety as those of\\nSwitzerland and Savoy. They form the highland background to Turin which\\ngives it its magnificent and incomparable framing.\\n\\nTurin, or Torino, was the old capital of the Duchy of Savoy, then of the\\nKingdom of Sardinia, up to 1864, and to-day is the chief city of\\nPiedmont.\\n\\nTurin is laid out in great rectangular blocks, with long straight\\nstreets, and it is brilliant and beautiful as modern cities go, but\\nthere is not much that is romantic about it, save an occasional\\nhistorical memory perpetuated by some public monument.\\n\\n \\n\\nTurin at the time of the founding of the kingdom of Sardinia, which\\nincluded also the domain of the house of Savoy, contained but 75,000\\ninhabitants. Said Montesquieu, who visited it in 1728: \\\"It is the most\\nbeautiful city in the world.\\\" De Brosseo, a few years later, declared\\nit to be \\\"the finest city in Italy, by the proper alignment of its\\nstreets, the regularity of its buildings, and the beauty of its\\nsquares.\\\" From this point of view the same holds true to-day, but it is\\nnot sympathetic and winsome in the least, and it is not for the\\ncontemplation of straight streets, square, box-like buildings or formal\\npublic garden plots that one comes to Italy.\\n\\nTurin's monumental memories are by no means non-existent or unclassed,\\nbut they are almost overpowered by the modern note which rings so loudly\\nin one's ears and flashes so vividly in one's eyes.\\n\\nOf them all the Palazzo Madonna has the greatest appeal. It was\\noriginally a thirteenth century construction of the Montferrats, but was\\nadded to at various times until well along in the eighteenth century,\\nwhen it became the palace of Madonna Reale, the widow of Charles\\nEmmanuel II. All its value from an architectural point of view is in its\\nexterior aspect, but its trim twelve-sided towers have a real\\ndistinction that a heavier, more clumsy donjon often lacks.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Carignano is a fanciful invention of an architect, Guarni by\\nname, who in 1680 had no very clear idea as to what a consistent and\\npleasing architectural conception should be. This palace's sole reason\\nto be remembered is that it was the residence of King Carlo-Alberto.\\nTo-day Guarni's original fa\\u00e7ade has been covered by a non-contemporary\\ncolonnade, with columns and statues of a certain impressive presence,\\nwhich would be considered handsome if it were some degrees finer in\\nworkmanship, for the conception was certainly on becoming general lines.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Valentino, built in 1633 by Christine of France, the\\ndaughter of Henri IV and Marie de Medici, and wife of Vittorio Amedeo\\nII, is now devoted to the usages of an educational institution. It is on\\nthe classic French chateau order and is as out of place in Italy as the\\nItalian Renaissance architecture is in England.\\n\\nOn the Piazza Castello rises Turin's old castle of the fourteenth\\ncentury, built of brick, and, though moss-grown, it is hardly a ruin.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Reale, built in 1678 on the north side of the Piazza, is\\nsevere and simple as to exterior, but luxurious enough within by reason\\nof the collections which it houses.\\n\\nIn the armory of Turin's royal palace is the full suit of armour worn by\\nDuke Emanuele-Filiberto on the occasion of the battle of St. Quentin,\\nand made by his own hand. He was an armourer, a silversmith and a worker\\nin fine metals beyond compare. In peace he was a craftsman without an\\nequal; in war he was the same kind of a fighter.\\n\\nAnother armour suit is of gigantic proportions. Who its owner was\\nhistory and the catalogue fail to state. The breast-plate bears a ducal\\ncoronet and the letter F. The suit contains enough metal to armour plate\\na small battle ship. For the more sentimentally inclined there is a\\ncabinet of delicately fashioned stilettos, which we have always fondly\\nbelieved were the national arms of Italy. These particular stilettos\\nwere taken from fair ladies after they had made away with their lovers\\nwhen they came to be a nuisance. Fickle women!\\n\\nTurin is one of the many places on the map of Europe famous for a\\nspecialty in the eating line. This time it is chocolate. Let not any one\\nthink that all chocolate comes from Aiguebelle or Royat. The bread of\\nTurin, \\\" grissini ,\\\" is also in a class by itself. It is made in long\\nsticks about the diameter of a pipe stem, and you eat yards of it with\\nyour minestra and between courses.\\n\\nThe puppet show or marionette theatres of Turin have ever been famous,\\nindeed the fantoccini theatre had its origin in Piedmont. The buffon\\nGianduja was of Piedmontese birth, as was Arlequino of Bergamo.\\n\\nAround Turin are various suburban neighbourhoods with historic memories\\nand some palace and villa remains which might well be noted.\\n\\nThe Vigna della Regina, or the Queen's Vineyard, is the name given to a\\nonce royal residence, now a girls' school. The house was built in 1650\\nby Cardinal Maurice of Savoy. Another one of the nearby sights, not\\nusually \\\"taken in,\\\" is the natural garden (an undefiled landscape\\ngarden) arranged in the sixteenth century by the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele\\nFiliberto.\\n\\nKing Carlo Felice had a country house called the Castello d'Aglie to the\\nnorth of the city. It is remarkable for nothing but the pure air of the\\nneighbourhood, and that abounds everywhere in these parts.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt Rivoli, a few kilometres out on the Mont Cenis road, is a clumsily\\nbuilt, half finished mass of buildings, planned by Vittorio Amedeo II.\\nin the eighteenth century as a royal residence to which he some day\\nmight return if he ever got tired of playing abdicator. He occupied\\nit surely enough, in due course, but as a prisoner, not as a ruler. He\\nwas a well-meaning monarch, and through him the house of Savoy obtained\\nSardinia, but he made awful blunders at times, or at least one, for\\nultimately he landed in prison where he died in 1732.\\n\\nSix leagues from Turin is the little garrison town of Pinerolo. A heap\\nof stones on the mountain marks the site of a chateau where were once\\nimprisoned the man of the Iron Mask, Lauzun, the political prisoner of\\nhistory, and Fouquet, the money-grabbing minister of Louis XIV.\\n\\nLauzun and his personal history make interesting reading for one versed\\nin things Italian and French. He made a famous mot when being\\ntransported to his mountain prison. He was requested from time to time\\nto descend from his carriage, whenever by chance it had got stuck in the\\nmud or wedged between offending rocks. With much apology he was begged\\nto descend. \\\"Oh! this is nothing; these little misfortunes of travel are\\nnothing of moment compared to the object of my journey.\\\" Other prisoners\\nmay have put things similarly, but hardly with the same grace of\\ndiction.\\n\\nLet no automobilist, on leaving Turin, come out by way of Pinerolo\\nunless he is prepared for a detour of a hundred kilometres, a rise of\\n2,000 metres and a drop down again to 1,300 metres at Cesana Tarinese,\\nwhere he strikes the main road over the Col de Mont Cenis to Modane in\\nFrance, or via the Col de Mont Genevre to Brian\\u00e7on. The direct road from\\nTurin is via Rivoli and Suse.\\n\\nNot every traveller in Italy knows the half-hidden out-of-the-way Val\\nd'Aoste, the obvious gateway from Turin to the north via the Col du\\nSaint Bernard. Travellers by rail rush through via the Simplon or Mont\\nCenis and know not the delights and joys which possess the traveller by\\nroad as he plunges into the heart of the Alps through the gateway of the\\nVal d'Aoste.\\n\\nThe Val d'Aoste, less than a hundred kilometres, all counted, has more\\nscenic and architectural surprises than any similar strip in Europe, but\\nit is not a piste to be raced over by the scorching automobilist at\\nsixty miles an hour. On the contrary it can not be done with\\nsatisfaction in less than a day, even by the most blas\\u00e9 of tourists. The\\nrailway also ascends the valley as far as Aoste, and one may cross over\\nby coach into France or Switzerland by either the Col du Petit Saint\\nBernard or the Col du Grand Saint Bernard. It is worth doing!\\n\\nThe whole Val d'Aoste is one great reminder of feudal days and feudal\\nways. Curiously enough, too, in this part of Piedmont the aspect is as\\nmuch French as Italian, and so too is the speech of the people. At\\nCourmayer, for instance, the street and shop signs are all in French,\\nand 'om the diminutive of homme replaces the Italian uomo ; cheur \\nstands for coeur and sita for cit\\u00e9 and citta . This patois is\\nuniversal through the upper valleys, and if one has any familiarity with\\nthe patois of Provence it will not be found so very strange. French,\\nhowever, is very commonly understood throughout Piedmont, more so than\\nelsewhere in north Italy, where, for a fact, a German will find his way\\nabout much more readily than a Frenchman.\\n\\nOne blemish lies all over the Val d'Aoste. It was greatly to be remarked\\nby travellers of two or three generations ago and is still in evidence\\nif one looks for it, though actually it is decreasing. Large numbers of\\nthe population are of the afflicted class known as Cretins , and many\\nmore suffer from goitre . It is claimed that these diseases come from a\\nsqualid filthiness, but the lie is given to this theory by the fact that\\nthere is no apparent filthiness. The diseases are evidently hereditary,\\nand at some time anterior to their appearance here they were already\\nknown elsewhere. They are then results of an extraneous condition of\\naffairs imported and developed here in this smiling valley through the\\nheedlessness of some one. There are certain neighbourhoods, as at\\nCourmayer and Ivrea, where they do not exist at all, but in other\\nlocalities, and for a radius of ten kilometres roundabout, they are most\\nprevalent.\\n\\nThe southern gateway to the Val d'Aoste is the snug little mountain of\\nIvrea, 50 kilometres from Turin. The cheese and butter of the Italian\\nAlps, known throughout the European market as Beurre de Milan, is mostly\\nproduced in this neighbourhood, and the ten thousand souls who live here\\ndraw almost their entire livelihood from these products. Ivrea has an\\nold Castle of imposing, though somewhat degenerate, presence. It has\\nbeen badly disfigured in the restorations of later years, but two of its\\nnumerous brick towers of old still retain their crenelated battlements.\\nThe place itself is of great antiquity, and Strabon has put it on record\\nthat 3,600 of the inhabitants of the Val d'Aoste were once sold en bloc\\nin the streets of Ivrea by Terentius Varro, their captor.\\n\\nThe Val d'Aoste, from Ivrea to Courmayer, about one hundred kilometres,\\nwill some day come to its own as a popular touring ground, but that time\\nis not yet. When the time comes any who will may know all the delights\\nof Switzerland's high valleys without suffering from the manifest\\ndrawback of overexploitation. One doesn't necessarily want to drink beer\\nbefore every waterfall or listen to a yoedel in every cavern. What is\\nmore to the point is that one may here find simple, unobtrusive\\nattention on the part of hotel keepers and that at a price in keeping\\nwith the surroundings. This you get in the Val d'Aoste and throughout\\nthe Alps of Piedmont, Dauphiny and Savoy.\\n\\nUp high in the Val d'Aoste lies a battery of little Alpine townlets\\nscarce known even by name, though possessed of a momentous history and\\noften of architectural monuments marvellously imposing in their grandeur\\nand beauty.\\n\\nNear Pont Saint Martin, high above the torrent of the Doire, is the\\npicturesque feudal castle of Montalto, a name famous in Italian annals\\nof the middle ages.\\n\\nOver the river Lys, at Pont Saint Martin, there is a Roman bridge; a\\nmodern iron one crosses it side by side, but the advantages, from an\\n\\u00e6sthetic and utilitarian view-point, as well, are all in favour of the\\nformer. A ruined castle crowns the height above Pont Saint Martin and a\\nfew kilometres below, at Donnas, is an ancient Roman mile stone still\\nbearing the uneffaced inscription XXXII M. P.\\n\\nThis whole region abounds in Napoleonic souvenirs. Fort Bard, the key to\\nthe valley, garrisoned by only eight hundred Austrians, gave Bonaparte a\\ncheck which he almost despaired of overcoming. The Little Corporal's\\ningenuity pulled him through, however. He sent out a patrol which laid\\nthe streets of the little village below the fort with straw and his army\\npassed unobserved in the night as if slippered with felt. But for this,\\nthe Battle of Marengo, one of the most brilliant of French feats of\\narms, might never have been fought.\\n\\nBard, the fort and the village, is now ignored by the high road which,\\nby a cut-off, avoids the steep climb in and out of the place.\\n\\nUnheard of by most travellers in Italy, and entirely unknown to others,\\nVerrex in the Val d'Aoste possesses a ravishing architectural surprise\\nin the shape of a feudal castle on a hillside overlooking the town. It\\nis of the square keep, or donjon, variety, and played an important part\\nin the warlike times of the past.\\n\\nThe chateau of Issogne near by, built by the Prior Geor. Challant, less\\nof a castle and more of a country house, is an admirable fifteenth\\ncentury domestic establishment still habitable, and inhabited, to-day.\\n\\nAll up and down the valley are relics of the engineering skill of the\\ngreat Roman road and bridge builders. The road over Mont Jovet, a sheer\\ncut down into the roof of a mountain, was theirs; so were the bridges at\\nChatillon and Pont Saint Martin, and another at Salassiens. At the Pont\\nd'Ael is a Roman aqueduct.\\n\\nChatillon, like Verrex, is not marked in big letters on many maps, but\\nit belongs in every architect lover's Italian itinerary. Its two bridges\\nof olden time are veritable wonder works. Its chateau Ussel, a ruin of\\nthe fourteenth century, is still glorious under its coat of mail of moss\\nand ivy, while the Castle of Count Christian d'Entr\\u00e9ves is of the kind\\nseen by most people only in picture books.\\n\\nAt F\\u00e9nis is a magnificent feudal battlemented castle with donjon tower,\\na chemin ronde and a barbican so awe-inspiring as to seem unreal. With\\nVerrex and Issogne, near by, F\\u00e9nis completes a trio of chateaux-forts\\nbuilt by the overlords of the name of Challant who possessed feudal\\nrights throughout all the Val d'Aoste.\\n\\nAimon de Challant built the castle of F\\u00e9nis in 1330. Virtually it was,\\nand is, a regular fortress, with as complete a system of defence as\\never princely stronghold had. At once a sumptuous seigneurial residence\\nand a seemingly impregnable fortress, it is one of the most remarkable\\nworks of its class above ground.\\n\\nAoste is a little Italian mountain town far more French than Italian\\nfrom many points of view. It is of great antiquity and was the Augusta\\nPr\\u00e6toria of various Roman itineraries.\\n\\nLike most Roman cities Aoste was laid out on the rectangular\\nparallelogram plan, an aspect which it still retains.\\n\\nAoste's triumphal arch, its city gate and walls, and its ancient towers\\nall lend a quaint aspect of medi\\u00e6valism which the twentieth century -- so\\nfar as it has gone -- has entirely failed to contaminate.\\n\\nFor lovers of English church history it will be a pleasure to recall\\nthat Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury in the eleventh century, was born\\nat Aoste. Another churchly memory at Aoste is a tablet inscribed with\\nthe particulars of the flight of Calvin from his refuge here in 1541.\\n\\n \\n\\nSaint Bernard, who has given his name to two neighbouring mountain\\npasses and to a breed of dogs, was Archbishop of Aoste in his time. His\\nperilous journeys in crossing the Alps, going and coming to and from his\\nmissions of good, led to his founding the celebrated hospice on the\\nnearby mountain pass which bears his name. The convent of the Great St.\\nBernard is the highest habited point in Europe.\\n\\nFrom Aoste to the Hospice of the Grand Saint Bernard is twenty-six\\nkilometres, with a rise of nearly 2,000 metres and a fall of a like\\namount to Martigny in Switzerland. The percentage of rise is\\nconsiderably greater than the route leading into France by the Little\\nSaint Bernard, which falls short of the former by three hundred metres,\\nbut the road is rather better. By far the easiest route from Turin into\\nFrance is via the Col de Mont Cenis to Modane; but a modern automobile\\nwill not quarrel seriously with any of these save one or two short, ugly\\nbits of from fifteen to seventeen per cent. They are pretty stiff;\\nthere's no doubt about that, and with a motor whose horse power is\\nenfeebled by the rarefied atmosphere at these elevations the driver is\\nlikely to meet with some surprises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nFROM THE ITALIAN LAKES TO THE RIVIERA\\n\\n\\nThere is one delightful crossing of Italy which is not often made either\\nby the automobilist or the traveller by rail. We found it a delightful\\nitinerary, though in no respect did it leave the beaten track of well\\nworn roads; simply it was a hitherto unthought of combination of\\nhighroads and byroads which led from Como, on the shores of its mountain\\nlake, to Nice, the head centre of the Riviera, just across the Italian\\nborder in France, entering that land of good cooks and good roads\\n(better cooks and better roads than are found in Italy, please remember)\\nvia the Col de Tende and the Custom House of San Dalmazzo.\\n\\nThe itinerary covers a length of 365 kilometres and all of it is over\\npassably good roads, the crossing of the frontier and the Lower Alps at\\nthe Col de Tende being at a lower level than any other of the\\nFranco-Italian mountain passes, although we encountered snow on the\\nheights even in the month of May.\\n\\nThis route is a pleasant variation from the usual entrance and exit from\\nItaly which the automobilist coming from the south generally makes via\\none of the high Alpine valleys. If one is bound Parisward the itinerary\\nis lengthened by perhaps five hundred kilometres, but if one has not\\nentered Italy by the Cote d'Azur and the Riviera gateway the thing is\\ndecidedly worth the doing.\\n\\nComo itself is the head centre for this part of the lake region, but we\\nused it only as a \\\"pointe de d\\u00e9part.\\\" Cernobbio is far and away the best\\nidling place on the Lago di Como and is getting to be the rival of\\nAix-les-Bains in France, already the most frequently visited automobile\\ncentre in Europe.\\n\\nFrom Cernobbio to Como, swinging around the foot of the lake, is but a\\nshort six kilometres, and from the latter place the Milan road leaves by\\nthe old barbican gate and winds upwards steadily for a dozen kilometres,\\ncrossing the railway line a half a dozen times before Milan is reached.\\n\\nThe detour to Monza was made between Como and Milan, a lengthening of\\nthe direct route by perhaps a dozen kilometres, and the Strada\\nMilitaire, which joins with the Bergamo-Milan road, was followed into\\nthe Lombard capital through the Porto Orientale. The direct road, the\\npost road from Como, enters the city by the Porta Nuova. There seems to\\nbe nothing to choose between the two routes, save that to-day one may be\\ngood and the other bad as to surface and six months later the reverse be\\nthe case.\\n\\nOn entering Milan one circles around the Foro Bonaparte and leaves the\\ncity by the Porta Magenta for Turin. Magenta, twenty-five kilometres;\\nNovara, forty-six kilometres; so runs the itinerary, and all of it at\\nthe dead level of from 120 to 150 metres above the sea.\\n\\nWe were stoned at Novara and promptly made a complaint to the\\nauthorities through the medium of the proprietor of the Hotel de la\\nVille, where we had a most gorgeous repast for the rather high price of\\nfive francs a head. It was worth it, though, in spite of the fact that\\nwe garaged the automobile in the dining room where we ate. We got\\nsatisfaction, too, for the stoning by the sight of half a dozen small\\nboys being hauled up to the justice, accompanied by their frightened\\nparents. The outcome we are not aware of, but doubtless the hotel\\nproprietor insisted that his clients should not be driven out of town in\\nthis manner, and, though probably no serious punishment was inflicted,\\nsomebody undoubtedly got a well-needed fright.\\n\\nThe road still continues towards Turin perfectly flat for a matter of a\\nhundred kilometres beyond Novara, the glistening mountain background\\ndrawing closer and closer until one realizes to the full just why Turin\\nand Milan are such splendid cities, an effect produced as much by their\\nincomparable sites as by their fine modern buildings, their great\\navenues and boulevards, and their historic traditions.\\n\\nThis borderland between Lombardy and Piedmont forms the very flower of\\npresent day Italy. The diarist Evelyn remarked all this in a more\\nappreciative manner than any writer before or since.\\n\\nHe wrote: \\\"We dined at Marignano near Milan, a grette cittie famous\\nfor a cheese a little short of the best Parmeggiano, where we met half a\\ndozen suspicious cavaliers who yet did us no harm. Then passing through\\na continuous garden we went on with exceeding pleasure, for this is the\\nParadise of Lombardy, the highways as even and straight as a cord, the\\nfields to a vast extent planted with fruit, and vines climbing every\\ntree planted at equal distances one from the other; likewise there is\\nan abundance of mulberry trees and much corn.\\\"\\n\\nTo arrive on the Riviera from Turin one leaves the roads leading to the\\nhigh Alpine valleys behind. Directly north from Turin runs the highroad\\nwhich ultimately debouches into the Val d'Aosta and the Saint Bernard\\nPasses; to the west, those leading through Pinerolo and the Col de\\nSestri\\u00e8res and Susa and the Cols of Mont Gen\\u00e8vre and Mont Cenis.\\n\\nJust out of Turin on the road to Cuneo (which is perhaps more often\\ncalled by its French name, Coni, for you are now heading straight for\\nthe frontier, a matter of but a half a hundred kilometres beyond) is\\nMoncalieri, the possessor of a royal chateau where was born, in 1904,\\nPrince Humbert of Piedmont, the present heir to the Italian throne.\\n\\nWhen Italy's present Queen Helena sojourned here after the birth of her\\nson she took her promenades abroad en automobile and so came to be a\\npartisan of the new form of locomotion as already had the dowager Queen\\nbefore her. The latter may properly enough be called the automobiling\\nmonarch of Europe for she is heard of to-day at Aix-les-Bains, to-morrow\\nat Paris or Trouville and the week after at Pallanza or Cadennabia, and\\nin turn in Spain, at Marienbad, Ostend, Biarritz or Nice, and she always\\ntravels by road, and at a good pace, too.\\n\\nThis up-to-date queen's predilection for the automobile in preference to\\nthe state coach of other days or the plebeian railway has doubtless had\\nmuch to do with the development of the automobile industry in Italy. It\\nhas, too, made the gateway into Italy from the Riviera over the Col de\\nTende the good mountain road that it is. Those who pass this way -- and\\nit's the only way worth considering from the South of France to the\\nItalian Lakes -- will have cause to bless Italy's automobiling queen. The\\nchiefs of state of Italy, France and Germany know how to encourage\\nautomobilism and all that pertains thereto better than those of\\nRepublican America or Monarchial Britain.\\n\\nCarignano, twelve kilometres beyond Moncalieri, is famous for its silk\\nindustry and its beautiful women. We saw nothing of the former, but the\\nlatter certainly merit the encomium which has been bestowed upon them\\never since the Chevalier Bayard remarked the gentilezza and beauty of\\nthe widow Bianca Montferrat, and fought for her in a tournament\\ncenturies ago.\\n\\nCarmagnola, a half a dozen kilometres off the direct road, just beyond\\nCarignano, takes much the same rank as the latter place. Neither are\\ntourist points to the slightest degree, but each is delightfully\\nunworldly and give one glimpses of native life that one may find only in\\nthe untravelled hinterland of a well known country. The peasant folk\\nof Carmagnola are as picturesque and gay in their costume and manner of\\nlife as one can possibly expect to see in these days when manners and\\ncustoms are changing before the new order of things. Here is the home of\\nthe celebrated Dance of the Carmagnole, a gyrating, whirling,\\ndervish-like fury of a dance which makes a peasant girl of the country\\nlook more charming than ever as she swishes and swirls her yards of gold\\nor silver neck beads in a most dazzling fashion. The French Revolution\\nborrowed the \\\"Carmagnole\\\" for its own unspeakable orgies, by what right\\nno one knows, for there is nothing outr\\u00e9 about it when seen in its\\nnative land. Possibly some alien Savoyards, who may have joined their\\nforces with the Marseilles Batallion, may have brought it to France with\\ntheir light luggage -- proverbially light, for the Savoyard has the\\nreputation of always travelling with a bundle on a stick. Would that we\\ntouring automobilists could, or would, travel lighter than we do!\\n\\nRacconigi, a half a dozen kilometres farther on, has another royal\\nchateau, and, passing Saluzza, through the arch erected in memory of the\\nmarriage of Victor Amedeo and Christine of France, one arrives at Cuneo\\nin thirty kilometres more. From Carmagnola to Cuneo direct, by\\nSavigliano, is practically the same distance, but the other route is\\nperhaps the more picturesque.\\n\\nAt Cuneo one has attained an elevation of some five hundred and\\nthirty-five metres above sea level, the rise thence to the Col de Tende\\nbeing eight hundred metres more, that is to say the pass is crossed at\\nan elevation not exceeding 1,300 metres.\\n\\nCuneo's Albergo Barra di Ferro (a new name to us for a hotel)\\naccommodates one for the price of five francs a day and upwards, and\\ngives a discount of ten per cent. to members of the Touring Club\\nItaliano. These prices will certainly not disturb any one who can afford\\nto supply a prodigal automobile with tires at the present high prices.\\n\\nWe climbed up from Cuneo to the Col, a matter of thirty-three kilometres\\nof a very easy rise, in something less than a couple of hours, the last\\nsix kilometres, the steepest portion, averaging but a five per cent.\\ngrade.\\n\\nOn leaving Cuneo the road ascends very gradually, running along the\\nvalley of the Vermagnana to the foot of the Col where it begins to mount\\nin earnest. Below is the great plain of Piedmont watered by the Po and\\nits tributary rivers, while above rises the mass of the Maritime Alps,\\nwith Mount Viso as its crowning peak, nearly four thousand metres high.\\nIt is a veritable Alpine road but not at all difficult of ascent. About\\nmidway on the height one remarks the attempt to cut a tunnel and thereby\\nshorten the route, an attempt which was abandoned long years ago. From\\nthe crest, the Col itself, one gets a view ranging from Mont Viso to\\nMont Rosa in the north and on the south even to the blue waters of the\\nMediterranean. For fully a third of the year, and often nearer half, the\\nCol de Tende is cursed with bad weather and is often impassable for\\nwheeled traffic in spite of the fact of its comparatively low elevation.\\nThe wind storms here are very violent.\\n\\nFrom Tende the road winds down into the low French levels, and in this\\nportion takes rank as one of the earliest of Alpine roads, it having\\nbeen built by Carlo Emanuele I in 1591.\\n\\nDown through the valley of the Torrent of the Roya glides the mountain\\nroad and, passing San Dalmazzo and numerous rock villages, a distinct\\nfeature of these parts, in sixteen kilometres reaches Breil, the first\\nplace of note on French territory.\\n\\nWe had our \\\"triptych\\\" signed at the Italian dogana fifteen kilometres\\nbeyond the brow of the mountain, at San Dalmazzo di Tenda, crossing on\\nto French soil three kilometres farther on.

Built up on the North in a series of beetling cliffs, the island slopes gently down through mountain chains and undulating plains to the golden Southern shore. An enormous triangle it is, spiny with lofty peaks - \\u00c6tna towers more than ten thousand feet in the air - spangled with flowering meads and dells where Nature loads the air with fragrance; pierced with infernal caverns, whence choking workers extract a large part of the world\\u2019s sulphur from the palaces of the former gods of the nether world; and fring\\u00e8d about on every side with the lace-like foam of opal waves. It is rich in beauty and desolation, rich in song and story, rich in architecture, splendid and varied. To understand the beauty and charm of Sicily, however, it is essential to know something of the island\\u2019s picturesque and vivid story. We Americans are rarely familiar with it. Strange as it may seem, considering Sicily\\u2019s importance through many centuries, its consecutive history still remains to be written. Books there are, to be sure, but none attempts to cover more than a portion of one of the most intense chronicles in the world. Thucydides, in his \\u201cPeloponessian War,\\u201d tells in glowing phrases of the d\\u00e9bacle that wiped out the Attic forces and left Sicily supreme. Later still, in the ante-Christian era Diodorus, a native of the island, prepared a flowing story of the Sicily he knew. It has been one of our chief sources of information ever since. In modern times the historians Grote and Curtius have included in their histories of Greece such parts of the Sicilian narrative as are germane to their work; and the English historian Freeman, in a monumental unfinished work, has left us a minutely detailed account of Sicily from prehistoric times to the reign of Agathocles. The Italian Amari, to go yet farther, handles the Saracen period with care and skill, and Gally Knight tells briefly of the dashing Normans and their fanciful architecture. But of the later periods almost nothing of lasting value has been written. Moreover, the books of travel dealing with Sicily are few in comparison with those which tell of other lands, and not many Americans discover, unaided, the paradise they omit from their itineraries. The most usual mistake made regarding Sicily is that it is a little island, vaguely located in imagination somewhere near Italy and peopled by Italians - its inhabitants, Black Handers, organ-grinders, scissors-men, ditch-diggers and the rest, mala gente all. Sicily is near Italy - two miles away, in fact - and it is full of Italians, in the sense that they are Italian subjects. But by heredity, by instinct, by everything that pertains to racial culture and development, they are far from being Italians yet. The explanation is a simple one. By consulting the map you see that the triangle - with an area of some ten thousand square miles - is not only in the center of the Mediterranean from East to West, but that it is also a great stepping-stone between Europe and Africa. In ancient days, when all the civilized world bordered the Mediterranean, the geographical position of Sicily gave the island an especial political character and importance. And naturally, while it remained the very center of the civilized world, it was a rich prize to be fought for by each Nation which rose to power. Tradition - as usual - peoples the land first with gods, both beneficent and malign, and then with giants to whom Homer refers in the Odyssey: Laistrygones, Cyclops, Lotophagi. After these \\u201cpoetic monsters\\u201d came the Sikans, Sikels and Elymians, genuine peoples, who may be called the prehistoric natives as distinguished from the historic foreigners. Of the three the Sikels, undoubtedly blood-brothers to the pioneers of Rome and Tuscany, are the most interesting; and a legend has it that they drifted on rafts from the Italian mainland across the channel now called the Strait of Messina, about 1100 B. C. They were permanent and important enough to give the island the name Sikelia, which is still current in our modified form, Sicily. The first of the historic foreigners to enter were the Ph\\u0153nicians, the Canaanites of the Old Testament, who lived in Tyre and Sidon and the other cities that lay in the narrow strip of lowland between Mt. Lebanon and the Mediterranean. They spoke Hebrew, as the Israelites did, but their worship was the foul and bloody service of Baal and Ashtaroth. They were the boldest seafaring men in the world; the most cunning traders, - who came to barter the Tyrian purple, the glass, the gold jewelry, and the little images of their own manufacture with the rude and primitive peoples already in possession. The Mediterranean had no terrors for their little barques, and they established trading posts and even actual colonies all along its coasts; one even, Gades of Tarshish - the present C\\u00e1diz - faced the ocean itself, beyond the strait now called Gibraltar, where the Pillars of Hercules guard the entrance to the Mediterranean. Ph\\u0153nicia has left us no means of dating her settlements in Sicily, but we know that they were founded sometime between the coming of the Sikels in the twelfth century and the coming of the Greeks in the eighth. The Greeks called these only rivals of theirs \\u201cbarbarians,\\u201d a name they applied to all who did not speak Greek. Yet this proved nothing as to their civilization, for at this early date the Ph\\u0153nicians were far advanced in the material arts over all Europeans, including the Greeks themselves, who learned of them. The most precious acquisition of all was the alphabet, from which every one of the forms of written speech now used in Europe has evolved. The Ph\\u0153nicians may not have invented it; they may merely have taken it from farther East along with their other material arts. But they were the distributors, the teachers, the popularizers, and as such we owe them an unpayable debt. The real history of Sicily, as a land playing a considerable part in the affairs of the world, begins with this coming of the Greek, and it is to his presence that the story owes its peculiar and immutable charm. As early as the times of the Odyssey the Greeks had some vague notion of Sicily. Everyone who has read that marvelous poem remembers that the suitors of Penelope threatened to sell the disguised Odysseus to the Sikels; and old L\\u00e6rtes had a Sikelian slave woman. But no doubt the wily Ph\\u0153nician traders told stories calculated to frighten away adventurous explorers; so it was quite by accident that the news which brought about the initial settlement reached Greece. Driven by storms upon Sicilian shores Theocles, an Ionian Greek, found himself late in the eighth century gazing from the deck of his tiny craft upon a strange land. This he explored a little before returning home and there reported it as a good country, with inhabitants it would be easy to conquer. The prospect tempted his fellow-countrymen. They were colonizers, not traders, and in the next hundred and forty years they occupied most of the coast of Sicily - Trinakria, Three Promontories, they called it - making of the island a second Greek world. Indeed, the city of Syracuse, founded in 734 B. C. by Dorians from Corinth, eventually became the rival and peer of Athens in wisdom, beauty and strength. Though the various independent cities of Sicily fought bitterly and continuously, their strife seemed only to develop genius and bring forth wonders in architecture, art and letters. The lofty purity of Greek civilization found its highest expression in magnificent temples which for grandeur and simplicity have never been excelled. To-day there are ruins of no less than twenty of these imposing houses of worship in Sicily, all of them of the same style, and many of colossal proportions. The arts of the sculptor and of the numismatist are represented in the museums by metopes which tell graphically of the evolution of the Greek ideal in temple decoration, and by coins which for pure beauty and delicacy have no equals in even Greece itself. A record of the illustrious Greek litterateurs who came to Sicily as visitors, or to spend the rest of their lives, is a list of immortals: Simonides, Sappho, whom an enthusiastic contemporary called the \\u201cviolet-crowned, pure, sweetly smiling Sappho\\u201d; Pindar, whose quaint lyrics give us much of our early Sicilian history; and \\u00c6schylus, immortal poet and playwright. Small wonder if with such inspiring examples in their midst native geniuses should have risen to great heights. Tisias of Himera is said to have set in order the lyric chorus, and so to have gained his name of Stesichorus. Epicharmus was the inventor of comedy, at least of the special Sicilian type. Some of his plays deal with mythology, many with cookery, and his comedy, \\u201cThe Wedding of Hebe,\\u201d furnishes epicures with a list of the Sicilian dainties of his day. Empedocles of Akragas, the most distinguished of Sicilian thinkers, became prominent as a physician and poet. Philistus, and the later Diodorus of Agyrium, were historians of the first rank. The fame of Archimedes the mathematician is imperishable; and Theocritus, also of Syracuse, gave to the world the first bucolics and pastorals ever written - strains so sweet that the very ditties the wandering shepherds on the hills to this day pipe to their flocks are but parodies of the lilting songs he made centuries ago. The commercially minded Ph\\u0153nicians gave the Greek colonists little trouble, but when Ph\\u0153nicia\\u2019s mighty African daughter - Carthage - grew up, she struggled long and hard for a permanent foothold upon the coveted isle. The crafty Carthaginians chose as the moment for their great effort the time when Xerxes the Persian, with forty-six Nations, was marching against Greece the mother-country, and Sicily could expect no assistance. But \\u201cZeus was too strong for Baal,\\u201d and both barbarian hosts went down to crushing defeat - some say on the same day - the Carthaginians at Sicilian Himera, the Persians at Salamis. Had it been otherwise, the very civilization of Europe would have been overthrown. The Carthaginians, though defeated, were not beaten. They kept coming; and two hundred years later King Pyrrhus of Epirus had to come over from Greece to rescue Greek Sicily. As he left the island he remarked prophetically: \\u201cWhat a wrestling ground I leave for Rome and Carthage!\\u201d Pyrrhus was right - the wrestling soon began in the first of the great Punic Wars, which ended with the utter defeat of Carthage. But while she was driven out, Rome came in to stay, and by 214 B. C. had swallowed up the whole island. Sicily was made the first Roman province, and experienced all the misfortunes of a \\u201ccarpet-bag government.\\u201d For centuries the peace made stable by Rome prevailed throughout the island, and the cities could no longer fly at each other\\u2019s throats. But as the price of this enforced tranquillity, former great ruling centers like Arkagas and Syracuse began to dry up into almost nothing as provincial towns, intellectual advancement ceased, and during the whole thousand years of Roman administration, Sicily kept the downward path in every field of endeavor. In this relaxed and enervated condition, the island fell an easy prey to the marauding Saracens; the condition of the Sicilians, worn down by oppression, explains their feeble resistance. Nothing could kindle a National feeling, and the conquest was marked by only a desultory struggle, in which the fervor of a few Christian devotees dared oppose the Muslim spirit of proselytism. In 965 it was all over. The Saracen had driven out the decadent Roman in the names of Allah and the Prophet, and established his own brilliant exotic civilization. Intellectual activity and agricultural development were fostered, and the Muslim r\\u00e9gime, though it was not to have any such permanence as the Roman it displaced, nevertheless developed with a splendor and rapidity that shamed the backward Christians. Last of all the great molders of Sicily came the Normans, knights who with their keen blades carved a slice out of the Byzantine Empire on the Italian mainland and, conquering the Sicilian Muslims, built up a kingdom for themselves. Sicily\\u2019s period of greatest glory dawned with their conquest. They developed a splendid fabric of feudalism; and all the arts as well as the more usual graces of civilization stamped the new kingdom for their own. The very Italian language, as Dante himself acknowledges, had its feeble beginnings in the court of the Emperor Frederick II at Palermo. The power of Frederick, who was Emperor of Germany as well as King of Sicily, was a thorn in the sides of the Popes, who at this period claimed the right to dispose of all the crowns of earth. So after Frederick\\u2019s death the Pope gave away the Sicilian crown to his own trusty defender, Count Charles of Anjou; and he, capturing the island from Frederick\\u2019s son, Manfred, turned it over to the shameful misrule of his lieutenants. Sixteen years later, in 1282, the French paid dearly for their oppression in the terrible massacre of the Sicilian Vespers, when they were exterminated throughout the island. Then the Sicilians invited Don Pedro de Arag\\u00f3n, the son-in-law of Manfred, their last Norman king, to rule them; and the Aragonese dynasty, with varying fortunes, lasted until 1409, when it became extinct, and Sicily was attached to Spain and governed by Spanish viceroys. Never did a government care less for its subjects; and when the Spaniards evacuated at the beginning of the eighteenth century, they left the unhappy island almost destitute. Sicily had long since ceased to be the center of the civilized world; and now, a mere appendage, she was tossed relentlessly from one sovereignty to another in the bitter struggle to maintain the balance of power. From this time onward her story is a complicated record in which France, Spain, Savoy, Austria, and even England herself are almost inextricably tangled. All this time, too, the common people, the backbone and life of the island, groaned under well nigh intolerable conditions. Gladstone, writing in 1851 of the Bourbon government, then ruling Sicily as a part of the Kingdom of Naples, said that its conduct was \\u201can outrage upon religion, upon humanity, upon civilization and upon decency.\\u201d But in this, her darkest hour, Sicily was not forgotten. Her insistent appeals for help, and the blood she had poured out in continual protest against the vicious Bourbons, were too loud a cry for the liberty-loving and adventurous spirit of Giuseppe Garibaldi to ignore. With his immortal \\u201cThousand\\u201d he answered, and became not merely the liberator of Sicily, but the hammer under whose forging blows the discordant states of the Italian peninsula were welded together into the new and coherent Italy. Thus at last a single man put the period to the island\\u2019s troubled history, ended definitely her ambitions for individual greatness and made her an important part of a greater and more powerful whole. So it is clear that there has never been a Sicilian nation, nor has there ever been even a Sicilian language; but every great race that dwells about the Mediterranean at some time has had a part in Sicily\\u2019s story, and each race in its turn has left an indelible imprint upon language and customs, upon architecture and people. Here one sees a pure Greek face of classic beauty; there a Saracen gazes calmly upon us out of features which could come only from the burning desert and the infinite starry night in the open; and yonder, a Roman, proud and silent, bends to toil the Romans of old never knew. On many a hill rises the matchless, mellow ruin of a Greek temple, lovely as anything Greece itself can show; and in the cities the architectonic genius and spirit of the races blend in structures dignified and massive, or light and airy almost to the point of being fantastic. This is Sicily to-day, the home of all beauty, the abiding place of a people as picturesque in character as they are in face and costume; and the sympathetic traveler, living the joy of the moment, as do the Sicilians themselves, comes into possession of much of the unforgettable charm and perfume of this island of delights. \\n\\n\\nI DISCOVERY \\nSicily in spring appeared to us like water in the desert. That we knew nothing of the island was a misfortune we shared in common with most Americans. Such vague ideas as we had were derived mainly from long-past schooldays of wearisome geography, and from newspaper accounts of the Mafia, whose members seemed always to be Sicilians. But when, after a stormy fortnight among the volcanic dust-clouds of a great Vesuvian eruption, we determined to escape that choking atmosphere, the royal Road to Rome chosen by the tourists - terrified by the belchings of the volcano - did not appeal to us. Instead, with some trepidation, as explorers entering a wild and dangerous unknown land, we decided upon Sicily. Our baggage packed and in the hallway, we came out to Gregorio, the cabman we had patronized through many a day of work and danger around Vesuvius. \\u201cWhere now, milords?\\u201d he smiled at us cheerily, noting the hand baggage. \\u201cTo the steamer, Gregorio - to Sicily.\\u201d \\u201cTo Sicily!\\u201d he exclaimed, dropping his whip in sheer amazement. \\u201cSanto Dio! - why?\\u201d The haze of volcanic cinders still hanging thickly over Naples was answer enough, with the added explanation: \\u201cWe must breathe; we must rest.\\u201d \\u201cYes, but - \\u201d His emotions choked him. Here was Naples deserted by the thousands of foreigners whom a few days of Vesuvian bellowings had frightened into abject panic. Cabs rusted at the street corners by scores; and now he, too, was to be idle. It was too much! Not even the promise of engagement upon our return could dispel the gloom that had wiped away his smile. \\u201cGia!\\u201d he grunted darkly, shaking his head. \\u201cIf the Signori ever return. Who knows, per Baccho! Sicilians are mala gente, brigands, murderers - \\u201d It was too late to withdraw, notwithstanding Gregorio\\u2019s cheerful prophecy, and he drove us to the wharf, a mournful figure drooping upon his box - and we sailed on Friday the 13th, at thirteen minutes past six! But whether it was because of lack of respect for either fateful numbers or hoary nautical superstition, or because of skill upon the bridge, the swift and trim little Galileo Galilei brought us pleasantly in the glorious dawn to Sicily, and an hour later Palermo - the capital - shimmered through the smoky mists veiling its Golden Shell. It was an easy and a delightful voyage, the steamer clean, the sea smooth. But if one is sea-fearing instead of sea-faring, he may go comfortably from Naples by train, via Reggio and the Strait of Messina, only two miles across by ferry. Or, if he be a sea-roving globe-trotter, he may take one of the numerous Mediterranean liners leaving New York the year round, and make the trip without a single change all the way to Palermo; and these vessels are so large and so steady that the trip is robbed of half its terrors to the most timid soul. But if money is an object, it is better to go by way of Italy, where little commutation books for Sicilian travel, called tessere, are to be obtained. Each tessera is a small pocket coupon-book sold in every large city, from Rome southward, from February to June. The books contain detachable coupons which entitle the holder to a discount ranging all the way from ten to seventy-five per cent in the cost of transportation, food, lodging, merchandise and amusements in the theaters. They cost ten lire (two dollars) apiece; and it is necessary only to fill out a given leaf with the date, the names of the stations to and from which the holder wishes to travel, and to present it at the station to obtain the discount on accommodations in any class desired on railway trains and steamers. A saving so large may be effected by its use that the transportation cost of the trip melts almost into insignificance. It seems too good to be true, but there is a reason for it. Count Florio, of the Florio-Rubattino Steamship Company, one of the most public-spirited men in Sicily, to popularize the island as a place of resort, to stimulate local travel in the best months of the year, and so to augment the revenues of both people and island, persuaded the Government to grant special rates on its railways by giving a sixty per cent discount on his own private steamers. Various large stores, theaters, caf\\u00e9s and hotels perceived the reason in his argument, and quickly followed his example. Moreover, as the Annual Sporting Reunion is held in Palermo during the late winter, it was felt - as proved to be the case - that inducements in the way of discounts on the cost of everything would considerably increase the patronage and make the annual games and races much more a feature of the island than ever before. Curiously enough, for a people so fond of red tape, the Sicilians have not smothered the tessere with senseless regulations. The concierge of your hotel can fill out and present the book for you when you wish to leave a city; the railroad ticket agent is not concerned with anything but your signature; and there are no difficulties about photographs as identification. But woe to the person who gives his tessera to a careless concierge! Half a dozen others may have done the same thing at the same time, and the tessere have become mixed. Unless one wishes to forge the usually almost indecipherable Italian name on the little green leaves, no ticket is forthcoming, no matter how fluent the explanation given; and a new book becomes a necessity. These winter and spring months are ideal for travel in this Mediterranean isle. In every age Sicily\\u2019s climate has been sung as halcyone, and in the days when Cicero was qu\\u00e6stor under the Roman rule, he did not exaggerate greatly when he said that there is never a day when the sun does not smile at least once. Not even Mentone or the other resorts along the Riviera can boast of a warmer or more sensuous charm than Sicily. January, which is the worst and rainiest month of the Sicilian winter, is very like the first two weeks of May in the northern part of Europe; and a short time later, when travel begins to waken the island, the sun shines clear and hot, an overcoat is wholly unnecessary except in the evening. Ripe and green fruit and blossoms are to be seen at the same time on the orange and lemon trees, and by April the scraggy old olive trees bend beneath the weight of their dull green fruit, just beginning to blush with purple. The air is full of the scent of myriad flowers, and the railway tracks, sometimes for miles, run between hedges of geraniums - six to eight feet high - whose pungent fragrance fills the flying trains. The summer climate is as mild and salubrious as that of the winter, for even in July and August the average is not more than seventy-seven or seventy-eight degrees Fahrenheit; about the same as in our own Atlantic States. Occasionally, during one of the African siroccos that sometimes sweep across the island, the mercury rises to an hundred or so; but the sirocco is a rare occurrence, fully as apt to occur in mid-winter as in summer. In a climate of this sort the jaded city-dweller, searching for health and rest, finds an ideal environment, and while the hotels are not the equals of the fashionable New York and London hostelries, they are comfortable and moderate in price; and many of them have splendid gardens attached, where one may have tea, or rest and wander at will among the scented bowers. One boasts a considerable aviary, and another, perched at the very edge of a precipitous crag, serves refreshments upon a stone promenade with the blue African Mediterranean right below, and the peaks of the Dark Continent faintly suggesting themselves through the mists of the horizon. Many of the best-known of these hostelries are located at historic spots, where history and imagination can conjure up the past vividly - aided, perhaps, by a too generous dinner. More than one traveler has fought the siege of Taormina all over again in his post-prandial dreams, and gone tumbling down the nine-hundred-foot slopes with the Greek tyrant, to wake up on the stony floor of his own bedroom! Notwithstanding, the food is good, except in the more remote districts, where goat\\u2019s flesh is usually the literal pi\\u00e9ce de r\\u00e9sistance. In many of the hill centers the wine of the country, the vin ordinaire, as the French put it, is remarkably pure and good, while for general attractiveness and cleanly condition, the hotels as a class rank very well indeed. Not so much can be said for the servants, for the Sicilian accepts dirt as a thing given of God and therefore not to be too severely quarreled with under any circumstances; yet he does his best to live up to the finicky notions of the foreigner who, to his unprejudiced eye, is so jaundiced. And the Sicilian\\u2019s best, in his efforts to please the stranger, is a very warm-hearted and genial best indeed, full of cheery smiles, of the utmost willingness to fetch and carry, of entire devotion, sometimes to the point of doing actual violence for his patron. It is characteristic of the people, indeed, that, having so long served for nothing, they should welcome the chance to serve for their own profit and pleasure combined; and the service is as pleasant to reward as it is to receive. Furthermore, the reward need not by any means always take the form of cash. In Italy everywhere one goes it is always tip! tip! tip! But in Sicily it is a delight to learn that one often secures as much for a smile and a gracious word of thanks as for a cash gratuity. In fact, tips are not infrequently refused. I shall never forget the expression that crossed the face of a schoolboy to whom I once offered half a lira, ten cents, for some trifling service. There was hurt pride in the rich brown eyes upturned to mine as the dirty little paw waved away the coin without a word. Another time, in the course of a detailed exploration of a prominent agricultural school in Palermo, the young priest in charge remonstrated with me, half in amusement, half in indignation, because \\u201cyou offered my m\\u00e1ma money!\\u201d To the apologetic remark that it is very hard to know when not to offer money, since everyone elsewhere in Italy expects it, the young philosopher, as cordial and proud as he was abjectly poor, helped himself to one of my cigarettes with a neat word of thanks and replied: \\u201cAh, but here it is different! We are a simple, kindly folk in Sicily, always ready to do whatever we can for the well mannered foreigner. And, friend, when you go out, do not try to corrupt my boys with money,\\u201d was his parting admonition regarding tips for any of his pupils. This picturesqueness of character extends to face and costume as well, and in the remoter places the dress and faces of the ancients may be observed, striking a curious note of contrast with the exceedingly modern and well appareled folk of the larger centers. Only fifteen miles by carriage from Palermo, back in the mountains at Piana dei Greci - an Albanian colony founded during the latter part of the fifteenth century - the peasants still hold during festival time to their rich and exceedingly beautiful costumes of embroidered silken gowns and breeches heavily picked out with gold. And a costume wedding can usually be arranged for the benefit of the interested visitor, who is expected to pay the officiating priest and make a modest gift to the newly married young couple. But ancient or modern though the costume be, the demeanor of the wearer is almost invariably the same, courteous and respectful - one might even say eager - to give nothing but pleasure to the stranger. And this is true even of the cab-drivers. We had come to Sicily weary to exasperation of the importunities and rascality of the Neapolitan jehus - Gregorio was a smiling exception. To our delight we found ourselves able to take a ride in Palermo, of half a mile or more, in a clean, well-kept barouche, drawn by a well-fed little Arab stallion, for ten cents - and no tip necessary or expected. The prices for longer excursions were on the same basis, and for weeks we had the services of a cab, a magnificent horse, and the peerless Gualterio, for about two dollars a day, including what to the Sicilian mind was a generous gratuity. And the carriage \\u201cran sweetly,\\u201d as Gualterio assured us it would; nor was it - in his own words - \\u201cdirty, like some!\\u201d Of course, the Sicilian cabman, for all his courtly manners and engaging smile, his soft voice and his continual appeal to the ladies, with the set phrase \\u201cLa Signora vuol\\u2019 andare - The Lady would like to ride?\\u201d (as she usually did, to the enrichment of the cabby) is not much more to be relied upon for facts, or as a guide, than his brethren in Naples or anywhere else in the world. The first time we saw one of the numberless slender stone towers that dot Palermo from end to end, rising to a height of about twenty feet, covered with fine vines and dripping countless tiny streams of water, Gualterio smiled angelically when asked what it was. \\u201cIt is very simple, Signore,\\u201d he replied instantly. \\u201cIt is one of the watch towers, built to enable the guards of the royal Ch\\u00e2teau of La Favorita to keep watch over the entire estate at once.\\u201d It seemed a curious thing that royal guards should combine duty with the pleasures of a cooling showerbath; but when I appeared to doubt it, Gualterio simply pointed at the iron ladder leading from top to bottom outside. \\u201cBehold,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAre not the ladders still there by which the guards climbed up and down?\\u201d Later we found the structures to be irrigating towers, as useful as they are picturesque, which is saying a good deal. How to make a cab-driver truthful is a recipe one seldom or never learns. Perhaps there is a way, but his fictions are so harmless and amiable, so entirely diverting and ingenuous, that it seems a pity to spoil a child of Nature with ironclad rules for veracity. Nor is the cabman the only Sicilian given to hyperbole or metaphor. The tendency is marked in all primitive peoples - a large part of the Sicilians are still primitive - to tell an inquirer the thing they suppose he most wishes to know; and the Saracenic blood in the Sicilian has doubtless left him a certain heritage of poetic imagination and exaggeration for the most utter commonplaces of life. At any rate, this inclination is found throughout the island, and it does not, except to the flustered tourist-in-a-hurry, seem a peculiar drawback or fault. Indeed, it rather adds to the fascination of the people, who appear to fit perfectly into their environs. Wild looking young girls, cherry-and-olive of skin, gossiping about the central fountains of their home towns, bear huge replicas of red Greek amphorai upon their well poised heads with all the grace of Greek maidens. Sprightly little goatherds, whose heads are the heads of fauns, and whose half naked and ruddy bodies are often clad in skins, ramble over the precipitous hills with nimble herds able to crop a living from mere stone-piles; and the fauns, Pan-like, pipe to their goats strains Theocritus might have loved. Swart mountaineers dress like their own rough hills in shaggy clothes topped off by big rough shawls; and seamen clump about, afloat and ashore, in boots and \\u201coilers,\\u201d or barelegged. The city folk are equally artless, with their tiny marionette theaters, their homeless meals in the open air markets, their goat-blessings, their innumerable other feste. And the Sicilians are not the only entertaining characters one meets. Sometimes our own countrymen - more often countrywomen! - are not far behind them. At a little mountain hotel, one evening at dinner a vivacious, black-haired, sloe-eyed, young woman with the air of one who comes, sees and conquers, told me in a breath her name, place of residence, father\\u2019s occupation, and asked for my credentials. I was rather stunned, but one of her companions - there were five of them in all - reassuring me by \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t mind Dulcie! She\\u2019s all right,\\u201d I admitted my identity. With characteristic American energy the trippers \\u201cdid\\u201d the town in one day, and long before we were ready for breakfast the next morning, drove away in an ancient barouche crammed to the guards with luggage, and drawn by three horses so rickety we wondered at the daring of the five women in accepting it. Dulcinea - have I her name right? - perched beside the grinning driver, her agile hands full of guidebooks, umbrellas and so on, gesturing with the fluency of Sicilian temperament itself, took in everything with a last comprehensive glance, and commanded the triumphal equipage to move. The hotel manager stood by the door blinking and dazed. Drawing a hand across his brow as the chatter died away in the distance, his lips moved in something that doubtless was a tribute to the \\u201cwonderful Americans!\\u201d In another dining room a weighty German, seating himself ponderously, drew from his pocket a sort of dog-chain which he carefully threw around his neck and attached by a spring clasp at either end to his napkin, spread carefully under his expansive chin. By the way, many Germans travel in Sicily; they seem especially interested in its classical history. The caretaker in one of the latomie in Syracuse complained: \\u201cMost of the people who have been here this year were Germans. Me, I do not like the Germans. They have no pockets! Now Americans are grand. They are all pockets.\\u201d After we left he may have concluded that some Americans are very German. There are many English, too, for they are everywhere; sometimes interesting, sometimes not. Besides these folk of to-day, legend and fable have peopled the island with myriad nymphs and goddesses, gods and d\\u00e6mons and heroes, equally interesting. Here in the smoldering caverns of \\u00c6tna dwell the grim Sikel gods of fire. There in the lofty central plateau is the very pool beside which Proserpina was weaving her daisy chain when stolen by Pluto and carried away to be queen of the nether world. High on the peak of an ancient western hill is the dueling ground where Hercules wrestled with King Eryx. And off the eastern shore are the very rocks the Cyclops Polyphemus hurled in his impotent rage at the escaping Odysseus. But song and story are not necessary to invest the natural scenery with its full share of beauty and importance. The Sicilian Apennines, like forked lightning, zig-zag sharply down from the northeast corner to the central southern shore - the rugged, cloud-piercing backbone of the island. Greek temples, great golden honeycombs of myth and history, tower up from hilltop and swale of emerald spangled with the gold of spurge and buttercup, splashed with the impish fiery tongues of countless poppies; bright groves of orange, lemon, citron, almond and carob trees in both fruit and flower scent the air with almost overpowering sweetness; broad brown fields bear acres of the dull green prickly pears; an occasional huge plot of ground newly plowed, with moist red furrows, waits open-lipped, to receive seed or shoot; and everywhere, acre upon acre, extend the vineyards, low-trellised and green, till from a height the country that the gods loved looks like a huge crazy quilt, folded and rumpled and vivid, dropped from the finisher\\u2019s hand and left lying where it fell. Picturesque towns on the very tips of inaccessible crags, walled about and defended by Nature, give perfect pictures of isolation. Other towns, white cities springing up from the golden sands of the African sea, coquette with the emerald waves that lap hungrily at their very doors. And the dashing tunny-fisheries off-shore - the brilliant sunshine glinting on the flapping white sails - the water boiling about the frantic monsters as they plunge and struggle to escape the stabbing gaffs of their captors; the water red and green and black at last, and the long line of huge, gleaming bodies - like titanic Spanish mackerel varnished an opalescent black - strewn upon the white and sparkling beach! What more could man wish to see? \\n\\n\\nII PALERMO \\nMost of the passenger steamers come into Palermo shortly after dawn, and in the pleasant, vernal weather of late winter, or in the real spring, the great bay is a waveless sheet of gilded beryl, dotted here and there with small boats so still they seem sculptured, in strong relief against the purple outlines of the cliffs at either horn of the bay. On the right, Monte Pellegrino looms square and massive; on the other horn\\u2019s tip Monte Zaffarano peers through the vapors, and the bay between their rugged shoulders is pent off from the sea by the slender arms of moles springing outward from the shore. Inside these breakwaters, solemn, black trans-Atlantic liners await their passengers, and flocks of rakish small boats, with queer, high, projecting cutwaters and painted in every dazzling, garish color that fancy can suggest, hop about like so many water-beetles. Prosaic fishing smacks full of rich, soft colors and melting lines idle along to lazily lifted sweeps, or linger beside the mole. And rusty little \\u201ccargo-boats that \\u2019aven\\u2019t any \\u2019ome\\u201d contrast sharply with the trim white Florio-Rubattino liners. Early as the hour is, half of male Palermo seems to come to the dock to shout a cheery welcome as the boat comes in. Throngs of hotel runners and porters crowd the wharves, all clamoring for recognition, each trying to drown out his neighbor\\u2019s voice; their queer, staccato cries, combative and challenging, sound as if projected from a huge phonograph to float loosely upon the jangling air. Yet for all this eagerness it is hard to find a man not too busy shouting to attend to the baggage. When one is secured, however, he vanishes like a gnome, to return a few moments later with the pleasing intelligence that he has smuggled your trunk through the customs guards, and is ready to perform prodigies with your handbags. Palermo\\u2019s modern commercial port is distinct from the ancient harbor of La Cala, now devoted almost exclusively to small fishing craft and rowboats because of its shallowness. Between the two basins projects a blunted little promontory, the reminder of that ancient tongue of land which divided the bay of Panormos of old. On that projecting finger of ground the Ph\\u0153nicians built their mighty city, which looked straight out toward the rising sun. Yet no one knows what its ancient name was, nor what the citizens called themselves; we know it only by its Greek name of Panormos, All-Haven. And though the Ph\\u0153nicians have passed completely from the entire earth, and the Greeks remain a great Nation, this city which the Ph\\u0153nicians founded is still Sicily\\u2019s most beautiful and prosperous center, while the wonderful Greek metropoli of Akragas and Syracuse have dried up like mummies within the battered outlines of their once splendid shells. Palermo has long and deservedly borne the name of La Felice, The Happy. It is a white city with houses of pearl and roofs of carnelian, shimmering with golden sunlight against the dark background of vine-clad hills on the horizon and the rich green of the most fertile plain in the island, that sweeps, a vast natural amphitheater, from the edge of the sea up to the seats of the white gods on the cloud-veiled crags. Splendidly set is the city in the warm lap of its Conca d\\u2019Oro, the Golden Shell that blooms with countless orange and lemon trees whose golden fruits flash amid the glossy green of the foliage and give the rolling plain its name. Pink and white almonds, citron, palms, ilex and pomegranate make it a great botanical garden, perfumed with the jasmine of Araby, the geranium, the pallid lily and the rose. The system of irrigation introduced centuries ago by the Saracens still obtains throughout this favored plain, increasing its productiveness twenty-fold. Fringing the city, splendid villas and great beautiful gardens bring a blush to the emerald cheek of the rolling environs. One feature of parks and gardens throughout Sicily that no American can fail to notice is the lack of prohibitory signs, such as \\u201c$1 $2\\u201d Royal, noble or ordinary, these grand floral and arboreal displays are open to the public practically all the time, yet no one is ever offended by d\\u00e9bris left by picknickers, by broken-off twigs or blossoms. The Sicilian knows that an infraction of the rights of the owners would result immediately in the closure of these parks and gardens, and he respects his privilege of entry. Many who come to Palermo do so expecting to find a typical south-Italian seaport, indescribably filthy, and teeming with guides and beggars - as determined as their native fleas to make a living from the visitor. To all such the reality comes as thrice welcome. They find a city beautiful, teeming with life and color, brilliant and irresistible, its citizens well dressed, orderly and courteous, at least so far as the traveler sees them. They congest the narrow sidewalks in an easy-going, gossiping, arm-in-arm throng never in a hurry and never to be stirred to haste by the polite \\u201cPermesso, Signori!\\u201d of the foreigner. Rather when urged to speed do they stop short to stare in amazement at such a phenomenon as anyone pressed for time. Handsome shops with alluring window displays line the principal thoroughfares, which run through the city in a huge cross. Clean, convenient trolley systems vein the capital\\u2019s face with crows\\u2019-feet in thin gray lines; enticingly black and narrow little vicoli thread devious ways among the houses, where the curious may wander unafraid, and unashamed of his curiosity and interest. And every alley, every byway and passage is spotlessly clean; while the gardens of the city, scattered with prodigal lavishness throughout even the business section, are beautiful beyond description. At first the senses refuse to take in anything more than a strange, exotic, gorgeous medley of light, color, sounds; an unfathomable jumble of men and animals, of quaint buildings and strange vehicles, of street cries weird but melodious, of the faintly scented brilliant atmosphere - of the half-revealed, half-guessed-at Soul of the City. Perhaps the two main streets constitute the best monument the Spaniards have left behind them. They may not have cared for Sicily; but for themselves and their convenience and comfort they cared much. So the Spanish viceroy, Don Pedro de Toledo, ran a fine broad street straight from the smiling sea through the middle of the town, and called it for himself, the Toledo. It is now the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele - practically every city of any importance in Italy has testified in this same way to its love for the united country\\u2019s first king. Crossing this ancient Toledo is the other highway, the Via Maqueda, laid out by another viceroy, the Duque de Maqueda, a short time later. The curious square - it is an octagon, by the way - where these two streets intersect at right angles, is called by the whimsical Sicilians the Quattro Canti, or Four Corners. The fa\\u00e7ades of the abutting buildings are concave, and each affords lodgment for statues of a Season, a Spanish King and a female saint - who might be in a deal better company! Our first morning on the Corso we were halted by a terrific outburst of sound from the very heart of the throng. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d I exclaimed, swinging my camera into position. \\u201cA fight; somebody being murdered?\\u201d But La Signora was not minded to be left a widow in a strange land for the sake of a putative photograph, and halted me. The cry stopped: as we listened it began again. Angry and defiant, bellicose even, it rose clear and strong above the noise of the street, held a moment, faded in slow diminuendo into the beautifully clear note of a great and playful animal baying for sheer joy of his own strength. The sauntering crowds paid not the slightest attention to the amazing volcanic outburst of vocal fireworks; not one of the alluring shops beside us was emptied of its customers; the tiny Sardinian donkeys in the shafts of the gayly painted little carts did not even lift an ear, but pattered gravely onward; and we, moving with the crowd, looked sheepishly at one another when we reached the corner. Standing in an angle of two house walls was a little seller of sweetened water, holding his big red amphora by one ear, his gaudy little yellow-red-blue stand bright with clinking bottles and glasses. As we stopped, he stunned us again with his musical bellow, and knowing we would not buy his \\u201cAaaaacquuuuaaaa! Aaaaacquaaaaaaaa d-o-l-c\\u2019!\\u201d struck a picturesque attitude and posed for us instead. He is there yet - or another water-man is, for it is a fine corner for business. Along the Via Maqueda and its continuations, the Ruggiero VII and the Avvenida della Libert\\u00e0, the fashionable corso, or afternoon driving promenade of all classes, takes place. The handsome street is an endless chain of moving vehicles of every description. Here a spanking team of blooded bays with silver-mounted harness draws the smart London trap of a young Florio; there a rickety old barouche, guiltless of varnish for many a long year, so crowded with a stout family party of six that its rheumatic springs creak, and the wind-broken old hack who pulls it feels his waning powers severely taxed. A splendid young Arab, full of blood and pride, pulling a new victoria, follows a ducal cart and precedes another overflow meeting, this time a stag party. Flashily dressed young gallants with cigarettes and straw hats \\u00e0 l\\u2019Anglais, loll back in decent traps and carts, making sheep\\u2019s eyes at the demure young girls who ride in maiden reserve beside their silent mothers. Every Palermitan who can, rides in this social promenade. What matter if his vehicle be but a cheap hired victoria; what if he go to bed supperless; has he not had the supreme delight of playing milord in elegant leisure among the nobility and the rich forestieri (tourists) who take the air on the city\\u2019s stateliest avenue? It not infrequently transpires that one carriage, one horse and one coachman are owned - and alternately used - by two or three families. The coachman in all probability not having been paid for a year or two, cannot afford to run away; the emaciated steed, not having had a really square feed of good sweet oats for an equally distressing period, could not run away if he would; and if both horse and driver should by fell conspiracy bolt, the faithful old carriage would quickly fall to pieces rather than have any part in the undoing of its worthy owners. Those of the nobles too poor to own a carriage alone, and far too proud to appear in hired ones, are not too proud to adopt the tactics of their humbler brethren, and go shares in an outfit with other nobles of equal pretensions and as poor as themselves. Only one extravagance marks the common ownership of what might be called these \\u201cparty rigs.\\u201d Each count or baron or prince naturally boasts \\u201carms\\u201d as the insignia of his rank; and these symbols must of necessity embellish his carriage doors, that he who walks may know at a glance the name and fame of him who rides. From this dilemma the Sicilian has contrived an ingenious escape. Each noble has his own set of emblazoned doors. So when the tired horse brings his Highness the Prince back to his \\u201cpalace,\\u201d presto! off come the princely doors, on go the ducal or baronial ones, and his Grace the Duke or the Baron rides serenely off in his own private equipage! Of all the vehicles in the world, there is nothing, however, to equal the Sicilian cart, carved, yellow, paneled with lurid paintings that run the gamut of myth and history. One we saw had upon its panels scenes representing Columbus sailing from Palos and discovering America; a bloody fight around the citadel of Acre; the hermitage of Santa Rosalia; and on its tailboard a vivid presentation of the massacre of the Vespers. These carts are never very large, as carts go; but they are so marvelously wrought, they ought surely to come under the provisions of the law which forbids the exportation of any works of art. Wheels, shafts, axles, the edges of sides and posts and tailboards are all worked into neat geometrical designs, and on the axle is a carving built up clear to the bottom of the cart, a mass of intricate scroll-work and gingerbread, in the middle of which sits the patron saint of the fortunate owner. \\u201cIf you expect a cart-driver to tell you the truth, make him swear by the saint sitting upon his axle,\\u201d is almost a proverb in Palermo. Would there were saints on the cabs, too! Often the horses\\u2019s decorations are equally fantastic, with a three-foot cock feather rising between his ears, an apoplectic purple bouquet of yarn upon the saddle, and plenty of shrill little bells at jingly intervals all over. These gorgeous outfits are used for ordinary delivery work, and after working hours the family put chairs in and go for a ride in state. The bit is as queer as the harness: it isn\\u2019t a bit at all, but a plate of spring-steel strapped loosely over the horse\\u2019s nose, an horizontal prong projecting on either side. Attached to the prongs, the reins give the driver complete control over his animal, since by pulling them he gently but effectively cuts off the beast\\u2019s breath. This makes runaways impossible, and besides, is much more humane than a bit of the usual sort. The city\\u2019s street cleaning department is not such a joke as it appears. Looks are not its strong point - keeping the town immaculate is. The carts are simply scaly old specimens of these brilliant equipages; and the animals are tiny Sardinian donkeys, as pretty and gentle as any pet lamb, and scarcely bigger. One velvety little gray beauty we saw on the Via Maqueda was undoubtedly heartbroken at having such disagreeable work to do. We talked to him and petted him, but to all our caresses he made not the slightest response, merely hanging his head and suffering his fate silently, like the brave little beast that he was. Perhaps it is the cleanliness of these streets that makes the people use them as drying-rooms. In Naples they wash in the streets, and hang the clothes from window to window in narrow alleys. But in Palermo the people go much farther - they cover the fa\\u00e7ades of their very finest houses with linen which flaps in plain sight even during the fashionable corso on the broad avenue. On this same Via Maqueda are the two large theaters. The M\\u00e1ssimo, or Largest Theater, is a splendid structure, well named, for it is the largest theater not only in Italy but in all Europe, a dignified adaptation of ancient Greek ideals to present day needs. A block farther on is the Politeama Garibaldi, with a Roman triumphal arch entrance, and a two-storied Greek colonnade encircling frescoed walls whose polychromatic decorations are so exceedingly Pompeiian they suggest that Palermo may be the birthplace of a new renaissance in Italian art. The Sicilian of any class is always picturesque, always individual. He could scarcely be anything else if he tried, and the life of the masses in the city is like a show at the theater - a show, at that, in which even the supernumeraries are ever imbued with due regard for the proper setting and action of the piece. There is no more typical specimen of this condensed picturesqueness than the water-seller, whose bellow has musical quality and charm, as you discover after your first shock. He calls up Egypt and the streets of Cairo. Really, he is the survival of an ancient Arab custom. You find him everywhere, especially among the lanes of the Fiera di Pascua, the Easter Fair, a piece bitten right out of the heart of Coney Island. The Easter season, by the way, is an exceedingly fortunate time to spend in Sicily, because of the multitudinous festivities going on. For the Fair, great bare sheds spring up overnight in the square beside the M\\u00e1ssimo, mushroom-like - a sunstruck Babel of crazily built and decorated shops and stalls and booths where everything imaginable is to be bought, from tinware and toys to rosaries and vegetables. About the booths eddies a jovial mob, pushing, chattering, playing practical jokes on one another, eating candy and the dubious Sicilian equivalents for frankfurters and kraut. Bands blare out fitful, horrible music from the roofs or windows of small sheds curiously mounted with painted legends or astonishing pictures in which the lack of perspective is the most prominent feature, unless it is the artist\\u2019s entire disregard for the principles of anatomy. \\u201cBarkers\\u201d in plate armor manufactured out of ancient kerosene tins from which the odor has by no means departed, vie with ridiculous clowns and short skirted dancers in proclaiming the attractions of their rival marionette and \\u201cminstrel\\u201d shows. And everybody wants to pose. Indeed, the Sicilians have a good humored mania for getting in the way of the camera, even when they know they are not wanted there and will never see a single copy of the picture. I leveled my camera at one queer stall, and instantly the people sprang together solidly, completely obscuring the booth, each man crying to his neighbor: \\u201cAspett\\u2019! Aspett\\u2019! Il fotografo!\\u201d In vain I pleaded. In vain Gualterio shouted and threatened and argued. The merrymakers laughed, and nodded, and stood like statues. In the confusion an important policeman stepped up, saluted respectfully, and said: \\u201cExcellency will be kind enough to move out into the street again. He is attracting citizens, and blocking the entire square.\\u201d Then he began unhurriedly turning over the human kaleidoscope. \\n\\n\\nIII A NIGHT OF DISSIPATION \\nPalermo is chimneyless. Hovels and palaces alike have no fires, except for cooking, and among the poorer classes very little of that is done at home, the people being steady patrons of the cucine economice, or \\u201ceconomical kitchens,\\u201d especially of those in the vicinity of the great public markets. Anxious to see these typical aspects of city life in tabloid form, we had our own dinner early one evening, and told Gualterio to take us through the poorer quarters, to show us the people getting their suppers, both at home and in the old market. Obeying literally, he drove us through countless piccoli vicoli or narrow alleys, dark little canyon-like slits between the houses. Strange shadowy forms flitted about under our horse\\u2019s very feet; black doorways gave yawning glimpses of deeper gloom beyond, lighted only by a tiny candle; here and there we passed vague silhouettes - a hungry man standing, hat on, before a table or sideboard gulping down his meager dinner, or a woman, Rembrandt-like, knitting, mending, reading, or amusing a child, in soft relief against the murk of the interior. Sharp cries from the driver warned away the children sitting in the street, so narrow that the wheels of our carriage scraped the house walls on both sides while going through; women knitting slipped their chairs momentarily back into the doorways in order to let us pass. Street lamps at long intervals twinkled feebly, and after six or eight such streets were traversed we emerged into the glare and brilliance of the slightly depressed Piazza Caraccioli, home of the Fiera Vecchia or Old Market. Halting the victoria on one side of the square, we wandered about on foot among a bedlam more picturesque than, and fully as noisy as, the Easter Market. To describe the scene adequately is impossible - no one who has not seen it can gather more than the vaguest idea from any printed description of this vivid cross-section of lower class Sicilian customs. Dazzling light and pitchy darkness alternate sharply, with no intermediate nuances of softer shadow, and the hurrying people rush hither and yon like so many busy ants. Adding to the confusion of the scene, the peddler and vendor shout out their wares: \\u201cWater!\\u201d \\u201cOlives!\\u201d \\u201cArtichokes!\\u201d \\u201cFish!\\u201d A chorus of lesser cries swell into diapason invitations to buy all manner of things one does not wish and can not possibly use, and there is much good natured chaff for the forestieri. Men, women and children by the score are everywhere, some eating where they stand, some carrying food home. Small pails of gleaming charcoal bear upon their heads great kettles of boiling artichokes. Steam and aroma from the cooking meats and vegetables; the smoke of lamps, candles and torches and burning fat and grease in the frying pans; escaping gases from the ranges in the \\u201ceconomical kitchens,\\u201d from the charcoal fires, and from the coal stoves; the innumerable smells of fresh vegetables, meat, fish, both salt and fresh, cut flowers and goats, with an additional tang of cheap wine, gushing from big casks into pails and bottles in the open shops, mingle in a composite odor by no means as unpleasant as might be thought. The whole scene is a delight to the eye. Here is a good sized wine shop, its front entirely open, showing two rows of casks and an imposing array of copper bright as the sun; yonder a vegetable store completely covered with onions suspended in long strings, bunches and wreaths, decorated fancifully with green leaves and little rosettes which afford a background of decidedly striking type for an image of the Holy Bambino, itself of onion color, and barely discernible among the rustling strings of bulbs over the door. Beside us a tiny restaurant, its front all gas-range, yawns enticingly, while opposite glows the fiery eye of an artichokeman\\u2019s tiny charcoal fire. Vendors of fried entrails and stomachs squat beside their frying pans and baskets, perforated ladles in their hands, exactly like our frankfurter men; while water-men with their highly colored stands full of clinking glasses swing along, bellowing cheerfully. Great gaudy signs in blue, red and yellow proclaim the prices of empty eggs, strung on threads, or impaled upon wooden spearlets, and stuck up over the front of a shop. Evidently the Palermitan distinguishes as we do between \\u201ceggs,\\u201d \\u201cfresh eggs\\u201d and \\u201cstrictly fresh eggs,\\u201d for the price varies considerably. However, the careful buyer we watched trusted not in signs or portents, but weighing each egg carefully as he bought, placed a dozen or more of the fragile things in his coat pockets despite the throng. Why a purchaser never comes home with an omelet in his clothes is a mystery, for we found it exceedingly difficult to work our way through the crowd. Yet, when I questioned the egg-seller he declared that no one ever broke an egg. A man with a pretentious stand like the American quick lunch counters stood behind a narrow smoking counter full of hidden fire, bearing a frying pan on top. On his left a bowl of strong shredded cheese faced other dishes of butter and rolls. He was a very popular caterer, too, for while we stood watching him a number of customers came up, giving an order in the peasant dialect which we could not understand, and the proprietor with a deft turn of his hand split a roll, covered it liberally with a rich thick layer of shredded cheese looking like toothpicks, placed upon that a few scraps of the meat he was cooking below, and deluging the whole with a spoonful or two of boiling grease, served up the tit-bit to his eager customer. In Sicily the butchers sell the offal and entrails of slaughtered animals, which in America are turned over the soap manufacturers or thrown away. The kitchen-man who buys them cuts up the stuff, boils it in its own fat, and sells it in the reeking buns at a penny apiece. The sturdy Sicilian seems to enjoy and thrive on this horrible mess, and even the children come toddling up to clamor for their share. Macaroni of all sorts, curled, fluted, twisted, frilled, chopped into squares and lead pencil lengths, woven, braided into shapes numberless, decorates several of the stalls. Other booths sell candles; others, shoes; still others, nothing but cheese. Cobblers are everywhere, although it seems impossible - in a town where so many people go barefoot - that one-tenth of the shoemakers, who work from six o\\u2019clock in the morning until nearly midnight, can find anything to do. Notwithstanding this external poverty, however, there are in the houses of the very poorest in practically every section of the town sewing-machines, whose tireless treadles throb and pulse by day and far into the night, the seamstress bending over her work lighted only by the spasmodic flickerings of a little candle. Tiring after an hour or so of the bustle and confusion and glare, we set off again. In and out we wound, as in a dream, peopling the streets with imaginary rascals ready to rob or kidnap, until at last in a small open square we came to the brilliantly lighted wineshop and caf\\u00e9 of Sainte Rosalie, whose proprietor, himself partly French, thus Gallicizes the name of the town\\u2019s patron saint, and at the same time adds distinction to his caf\\u00e9 in the eyes of lower class Palermo. We stopped curiously, and the proprietor, immediately forgetting his patrons, invited us to get out and inspect the place. Filling almost one entire side of the large front room is a huge stove built of mortar-covered brickwork, upon which bubbled a couple of cauldrons, one full of goats\\u2019 stomach, the other containing scraps of something or other. Both smelled good - but how they looked! Opposite the stove hung meat which had been fresh that morning; piles of vegetables completely filled up the counter and various tables. All the coppers and cooking utensils were spotless, and marvelous to relate, there is a real chimney, and running water, both hot and cold. Sometimes you see a house which has a genuine iron cooking stove - but it stands in the parlor and the stovepipe is thrust conveniently out into the street above the closed lower half of the front door. The caf\\u00e9 is divided into two parts by an arch, and no curtains being hung, the diners can see perfectly how their food is being cooked. Leading us through into the Sala di pranzo, the proprietor, with a sweeping bow, waved us into two chairs at a table beside two native couples who were taking their belated suppers. The peasants greeted us frankly and pleasantly, the women smiling, and the men doffing their caps with a hearty \\u201cBuona sera, signori!\\u201d Not knowing exactly what was expected of us, we ordered vino e pasta, supposing we would receive some sour, fiery fluid, and the bad Sicilian bread. Instead there was set before us a large flagon of reddish-brown, rather heavy dessert wine, a little too sweet to be palatable to Americans, but nevertheless delicious. Clean though coarse napkins and glasses accompanied it, and delicious almond sweet-cakes in far greater quantity than we could eat. The price of this refreshment was so ridiculously small that we wondered at first whether Boniface had not made a mistake. Our trip through the market and the piccoli vicoli thus pleasantly finished, I told Gualterio to take us to the theater. That anyone would be willing to miss a minute of pleasure he must pay for was incomprehensible to his simple mind. Draining his beaker at a gulp, he nearly dropped the glass in astonishment. \\u201cMa - signore! \\u00c9 troppo tard\\u2019! Ora si finisc\\u2019 il prim\\u2019 atto!\\u201d he exclaimed. \\u201cIt is too late! The first act is surely over!\\u201d \\u201dOh, I did not mean the fine theaters where the rich people go, but a little theater, a theater of the people - where you go when you have an evening to yourself.\\u201d A curious expression came over his face, but making sure that we knew what we were talking about, he drove rapidly to the door of a dirty and dilapidated looking house in a small side court. Though we did not expect marionette shows to be given in a very splendid auditorium, we were scarcely prepared for this, rather hesitating to enter. The door was divided, the lower half closed, the upper open. Inside hung a short, flapping black curtain, while about the door loitered a little group of street urchins who dodged up when the doorkeeper\\u2019s back was turned, to peep eagerly into the slit of brilliance that revealed the stage between the upper edge of the half-door and the bottom of the curtain. As we, too, peeped, Gualterio whispered that here was a theater whose audience numbered the very poorest and the humblest in the city, adding apologetically: \\u201cPerhaps it is too poor for Excellency. I have been here and enjoyed the performance, but Excellency is accustomed to the fine theaters, and the Signora may not like this very well.\\u201d On the contrary, that was exactly the sort of theater we did wish to see. The glimpse we got through the open door of the auditorium however, was not reassuring; and furthermore there was not a woman present. I knew all about the custom of the Sicilian theaters, which announce two different sorts of plays - \\u201cTo-night for men;\\u201d \\u201cThis is a play for ladies.\\u201d Naturally, seeing no sign of the more particular sex, I jumped at the conclusion that this must be a man\\u2019s night. But disturbed by our conversation outside, the doorkeeper-proprietor and at least half of the audience politely arose and insisted that we should enter. With some misgivings we did so, paying two cents apiece for seats. Afterward I learned that the impresario had charged us exactly double what anyone else paid. The seats consisted of a few hard wooden benches without any backs, and the one reserved place in the entire theater - which was a room perhaps thirty feet square with two galleries some five feet above the floor on both sides - was a single broken-backed kitchen chair perched upon one of the benches in the middle of the house. The only well dressed man in the room, who occupied it, gallantly sprang down at once, and with a delightfully courtly bow and smile assisted the protesting Signora to his place. The audience numbered about forty or fifty fisherman, peddlers, a cabman or two and a miscellaneous collection of as jovial looking pirates as ever scuttled a ship or slit a throat. But for all their appearance, they behaved exactly like American opera-goers, and the stir that our entrance made set every tongue chattering at a lively pace. The stage stretched across the end of the pit at a height of perhaps three or four feet above the floor, and on a rack of some kind at the left of the place where the footlights should have been, was a quantity of wilted green vegetables. Thinking of what happens to inferior actors in the rural districts here, I inquired with some anxiety if the vegetables had been laid aside for that purpose. But the man to whom I spoke, missing the joke entirely, replied with the utmost simplicity: \\u201cOh, no, Giuseppe laid his pack there because it was too big to place between the seats.\\u201d How homelike it would seem to the weary street hawker in New York, could he but stop at the theater on his way home, and occasion no remark by leaving his left-over stock in trade at the feet of the actors for the time being. As soon as La Signora was ensconced upon her uncertain \\u201creserved seat,\\u201d the men who sat beside me on either hand began to explain the play in what they probably considered words of one syllable. The fancily dressed young man at my right seemed impatient at the remarks of my white-haired left-hand neighbor, who smelled strongly of tar, and whose sixty years and showerbath dialect made him both attractive and unintelligible to me. Both men talked at once and at high speed. In the meantime everyone else all over the house was talking cheerfully; and the play was proceeding as calmly as though there were no interruption. Between the two explanations, neither of which I could understand, I had considerable difficulty in catching the words of the play, which was being read by a gentleman whose lungs must have been rubber and whose throat brass. He stood back of the proscenium somewhere and bellowed or whispered in fine frenzy at every dramatic point, as the marionettes performed their astonishing evolutions. The puppets were handsome armored figures about three feet high, clothed in glittering plate and chain armor, accoutered cap-\\u00e0-pie, their shields properly blazoned and their surcoats faithful models of the garments worn by the ancient knights. Marching, filing and counter-filing, they made addresses to the accompaniment of stiff, clattering gestures, fought duels of deadly outcome with clashing weapons and rasping wires in the glare of half a dozen smoky oil lamps, and moved about easily, manipulated by the expert hands of operators who were standing in the wings. Every little while a human hand would burst into view, grotesquely gigantic compared with the puppet whose fate was in its keeping. The play was one of the familiar favorites, representing the endeavors of invading Moors to convert Christian Sicilians to Mohammedanism, but the author was somewhat mixed in his history. Beside the Sicilians and Moors he worked in Frenchmen, and before the play was over, the story was that of a struggle between the two Christian nations, the Mohammedans obviously forgotten. The wicked, wicked Frenchmen were, of course, defeated, and their bloody schemes met with the noisy condemnation of the little crowd, while their opponents, the ancestors of these same street boys and hucksters and fishermen, won as hearty approval. In the interval between the fourth and the last acts I had a chance to inquire of my neighbors why there were no women present. Both men regarded me with astonishment, and the younger answered first. \\u201cWomen? Women in the theater? Why, the theater is not good for them. I never bring my woman!\\u201d Evidently a foreign woman was different, and none of the audience seemed to regard it as strange that one should be among them. As we came out into the fresh night air, Gualterio was apologetically solicitous, a little nervous as to the success of his experiment in bringing us to this particular theater. But our manifest satisfaction with our night of dissipation speedily reassured him, and all the way back to the hotel he sang canzone to his chunky little Arab out of pure joy and thankfulness. \\n\\n\\nIV CATHEDRALS \\nIt has already been pointed out that the Easter season is an especially good time to be in Palermo. On Easter morning the great Court of the Lord before the Cathedral is a surprising picture. Upon the heavy stone balustrade enclosing it sixteen massive saints meditate benignly in the scented air. The great gray cement yard, flowers all colors of the rainbow, marble Santa Rosalia - patroness of Palermo - the huge church itself: all are bathed in the most brilliant sunshine imaginable. Words and pictures alike fail to give any adequate expression of it. The noise and unrest of the busy Corso are forgotten in this magic precinct; smiling, happy men, women and children stream through the yard, picturesque in their holiday attire; while from the windows drones the chant of the Mass, like the buzzing of a swarm of kindly bees hovering over the flowers. The white glare of the Egyptian desert is never more blinding than a Sicilian spring morning radiance. Though the service calls, religion in Sicily takes small heed of the antics of foreigners, and if one chooses to stay outside in the courtyard and take photographs, it causes not the slightest comment. The main charm of the Cathedral lies in the curious blending of its different forms of architecture - Arabic, Norman, Gothic; which produces a dashing and almost whimsical effect in its fine arcades, its rich friezes and battlements, its interlacing arches, and its airy turrets outlined against the blue sky. Two graceful flying arches connect the Cathedral with the campanile or belfry which, as is often the case, is separated from the Cathedral proper - in this instance across the street. The vast structure as a whole is the very epitome of Sicily\\u2019s many sided culture and art during her high tide of glory, the Norman period. A witty Englishman has fitly remarked that the badly restored and whitewashed interior, however, is of the \\u201crailroad station type.\\u201d In the south aisle chapels, though, are the excellent tombs of the kings, the grim and silent last homes of the marvelous Frederick, that \\u201cWonder of the World,\\u201d of Henry VI, The Butcher, of Constance the Broken-Hearted, and of others. A great crimson porphyry sarcophagus holds the dust of King Roger, of whom it has been well said indeed that he was \\u201cone of the wisest, most renowned, most worthy, and most fortunate princes of his time\\u201d (Freeman). Kneeling Norman nobles carved in white marble upbear the simple, boxlike mass of porphyry upon their armored shoulders. What an expression of the homage of the people! The simple inscription, in Latin, reads: IN QUIET AND PEACE, ROGER, STRENUOUS DUKE AND OF SICILY FIRST KING, IS DEAD IN PANORMOS, THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY IN THE YEAR 1154. So it would seem that we are not the first people to discover \\u201cthe strenuous life!\\u201d And King Roger\\u2019s life was certainly strenuous. But it was nothing at all compared to the career of his father, who landed stealthily in Sicily by night with a handful of trusty knights and men-at-arms, captured Messina before breakfast, and stormed on through the island, felling the Saracens like so many saplings. The Norman conquest was distinguished throughout by the most impossible feats of both personal valor and consideration; the island was ready for Roger to knit together and administer when he succeeded his father, and played the r\\u00f4le of lawgiver and organizer to his fiery parent\\u2019s conquests. And young Roger rose even higher than his father. Where he had been Count, Roger made himself not only King of Sicily, but ruler of a considerable part of Southern Italy as well. What manner of man he was is shown by an ancient mosaic still on the wall of the church of the Martorana, a remarkable example in itself of Norman-Sicilian art. Notwithstanding the tremendous temporal power of the Popes in those days, this descendant of the vikings refused to be crowned by the papal legate, and the mosaic represents him placing the diadem upon his head with his own hands. The Martorana church was built by the King\\u2019s High Admiral, Giorgios Antiochenos, a versatile gentleman indeed, who amused himself while on shore leave or duty by building bridges and churches, importing silk weavers and generally playing the constructive and highly intelligent official, whose good works have long outlived himself. Throughout the island it is eminently proper to keep the key of a building as far away from its door as possible - it is the custode of La Martorana who gives open sesame to the Scl\\u00e1fani Palace. As you drive over, he ticks off its history on his bony fingers with the precious key: Built in 1330; afterward a grand hospital; to-day a barrack for the Bersaglieri or mountain riflemen. Practically the only remaining evidence of its former grandeur is a tremendous fresco attributed to a long-forgotten Flemish painter, on one of the walls of the courtyard. The fresco, measuring some eighteen feet in height by about twenty-two in length, is called Il Trionfo della Morte, The Triumph of Death, and its name is fully borne out by its grisly realism, as the white horse and his ruthless skeleton rider trample down those who wish to live, and ignore the wretched who plead in vain for release from their misery. With the latter group stands the painter himself, palette and mahlstick in hand; it is said he was taken ill while a guest in the palace. Perhaps the painting commemorates his feelings during that unfortunate experience. It is frankly ugly - there is no other word to express it - yet it still clings to the white wall and produces an astonishing effect, especially when one remembers that it is a faithful expression of the religious feeling of the epoch it stands for. While we were studying it, a well-fed American-in-a-hurry, evidently a person of importance Baedekering through Sicily, rushed into the court, asked abruptly if that were the great picture, thrust both hands into his pockets and, with feet wide apart, appraised it a few moments in patent disgust. It costs about a lira and a half - something like thirty cents of our money - to see the fresco. Pulling out a handful of loose change to pay the custodian, the stranger glanced first at his hand, then back at the painting. \\u201cThirty cents! Thirty cents - that\\u2019s exactly what it looks like!\\u201d he exploded, and was off before we could get our breaths. That Palermo had queer taste in the old days is indicated by the Scl\\u00e1fani fresco; and further evidence is not lacking in the crypts of a Capuchin monastery, a short distance outside the Porta Nuova. The vaults, long ago used as a burial place by the wealthier families of the city, contain at present some eight thousand embalmed bodies. This subway full of mummies is divided into several sections, the men and women segregated from each other and from the monks and priests, who have a gallery apart. Some of the bodies are in coffins or caskets of various sorts, but many have been hung up by the neck in cords like hangman\\u2019s nooses. Some skulls are entirely fleshless, while others are partially covered. Hands whose fingers have shrunk to black bits of petrifaction hang loosely from rotting gloves which now appear several sizes too large. Heads have slipped back to stare up at the cobwebbed ceiling, turned sidewise with most diabolical leers, moved forward as though to combat the visitor. Not a single skull is expressionless, even if devoid of flesh. Some are jocose, some piously sad, some morose, some menacing and grim. Within the artillery barrack a little farther out, is a ragged tower some thirty feet high that represents the ancient villa of La Cuba. An Arabic frieze about the bare exterior suggests the residence of some haughty old Emir of Palermo. The iconoclastic arch\\u00e6ologists, however, have shattered the popular belief by deciphering the inscription to prove that no Saracen ever lived there, but that the mansion was erected in 1183 by the grandson of Roger, King William II, \\u201cThe Good,\\u201d of whose reign one chronicler of the period wrote: \\u201cThere was more security then, in the thickets of Sicily than in the cities of other kingdoms.\\u201d Modesty, though, could scarcely have been the most conspicuous of that monarch\\u2019s many virtues, for the inscription reads: \\u201cIn the Name of God, clement, merciful, give heed. Here halt and admire. Behold the illustrious dwelling of the most illustrious of the kings of the earth, William II.\\u201d Tired out one night after a long day following the hounds through the forests outside Palermo, this same King William II, \\u201cThe Good,\\u201d lay down to sleep on a hill overlooking the city. And in his sleep, he dreamed: Out of the glades floated the shining figure of the Virgin, mysterious and inspiring, telling the awestruck monarch that the church he had sworn to build for her must be erected on that very spot. Slowly the dazzling vision faded, and when he awoke William named the hill Mon Reale - Royal Mount - at once beginning to prepare for the most splendid church in Sicily, a house of prayer worthy of both its divine patroness and its royal founder. In 1174 the actual construction began, and eight years later, thanks to the pious aid of the King\\u2019s mother, Margaret of Aragon, the Duomo of Monreale was solemnly consecrated. It was, however, unfinished outside, and to this day its barren exterior hints nothing of its interior magnificence. Around the Cathedral sprang up a populous little city of jammed-together houses along constricted, hilly streets, and eight centuries have not changed the town appreciably. It is possible to ascend by tram this crested slope upon whose brow the Middle Ages still reign. Unfortunately, the cars are not personally conducted to stop at the best viewpoints, so it is better, though more expensive, to take a cab. Once in a while in Europe the recognition of class distinction grips an American with a strangle-hold. That day in the Monreale tram it seized me, when a fat, overdressed middle-class woman of forty or so began to give herself more airs than a duchess. With her little son, she was taking up room enough for four ordinary people, when a spotlessly neat old peasant woman, with a decent murmur of apology, sat down in the half-vacant space alongside. The bourgeoise flared like a Sans Gene, jabbed at her parcels brusquely, and told her loudly not to intrude upon her betters. It was then that I wished for a second-class car, to save the old woman from such gratuitous effrontery. The Cathedral rises like a fortress before the town; its main doors - between two massive square towers, giving upon a dusty little square - are rich bronze leaves full of low-reliefs from Old Testament history. The first impression on entering is of a dazzling blaze of golden light, beating upon and beaten back from golden walls with stunning effect, in which the details of design and ornamentation, for all their clarity and importance, are so marvelously subordinated that they but add to the glowing display. Though the superb glass mosaics cover an area which Baedeker - with \\u201cMade-in-Germany\\u201d accuracy - declares to be 70,400 square feet, the lower walls are all pure white marble, with an upper border and slender bright-colored bands which run perpendicularly through the spotless white like the embroidery upon a holy robe. The vast nave and aisles are light and airy. There is complete absence of any artificial decoration - no tawdry, meaningless images, no hideous ex-votos to distract the eye. Harmony is the keynote of every inch of the decorations; from pave to rooftree there is not one inconsistent or jarring note. The great dome of the main apse is completely filled by a bust of the Christ in the same glittering, marvelous, indescribably mellow glass mosaic that covers thousands of square feet upon the walls. It is the face of the man traditional, the visage of one whose appearance has been handed down from father to son since the beginning, the likeness of a founder, a prophet. And the still, solemn wonder of it fills one like the recurrent chords of a great and stately harmony. It is the one feature that stands out high above the blinding golden haze. \\u201cNot a jarring note\\u201d - and yet, who that has seen those forty Old Testament mosaic tableaux on the upper walls can help recalling his first start of amazement at their literalness. They speak a dialect of art; they translate the Bible stories that the uneducated medieval mind could not read, into something that everybody could understand. A snow-white Eve worming her way out of an equally pallid dreamer\\u2019s side, and afterward decorously introduced by God Himself to Adam, is startling enough. But how about Noah, draped by a modest son, while in the vinous slumber brought about through a too generous testing of the liquid sunshine of his own vines? No details of these ancient histories was too insignificant or too broad for the artificers to weave lovingly into their master-work; and nothing could better illustrate the pure simplicity of the medieval mind to which anything Biblical was holy, and fit for presentation to all the world. One of the most noticeable features of the Duomo is the clearness and delicacy of every detail. In St. Mark\\u2019s in Venice, time has blurred and defaced almost everything and the better part of the mosaics is crumbling into soft decay; but here in Monreale the delineation is so vivid and sharp, each color so soft and pure in tone, it seems as though the master workman had laid down his tools but yesterday to pronounce his chef d\\u2019\\u0153uvre complete. We are apt to think of cloisters as gloomy, forbidding places, where half frozen monks with blue lips and hair shirts shiver about their religious tasks and wish - if they are human! - they had never been born. Of course, there are such cloisters - but not here in Monreale, where the glorious sunshine bathes all that is left of the monastery King William erected for his Benedictine monks beside the Cathedral. Pleasant cloisters these, warm and blooming and fragrant with ozone and the perfume of the flowers. And very pleasant, indeed, very much worth while, must have been the lives of the jovial Benedictine brothers during the high and mighty reign of William the Good! Even after seven hundred years the silent arcades are lovely, filled yet with slender columns about which climb ribbons of mosaic and garlands of living vines to set off the different capitals - the finest examples of twelfth century carving in the world. Every capital is different, and almost every one tells a story. The visitor can unravel for himself ancient legend or Bible story, picking out old familiar figures here and there in the mellow marble; or if he chooses, he can meditate upon the curious fact that the Normans were producing this glorious work in the island of the sun long before Giotto was born. Monreale\\u2019s streets are rugged and steep, but very clean and decent. The Monrealese, instead of naming their Corso for Italy\\u2019s first king, have named it for the town\\u2019s most famous son, the seventeenth century painter Pietro Novelli, whose studies of the monks are moving figures, clearly establishing him as the foremost materialist Sicily ever produced. On the Corso is Grado Salvatore\\u2019s three-boy-power macaroni factory, a queer, rambling, black sort of a cavern, lighted only by the front door. A macaroni-machine looking for all the world like Benjamin Franklin\\u2019s old hand printing press occupies the front on one side; and Salvatore himself sits in the little blue and white tiled sink before it, fanning and snipping the wriggly paste as the boys twist the screw and force it out in long strings. On the other side of the partition is a cluttered-up sales-room where every imaginable shape of macaroni and spaghetti decorates the shelves. Behind all is the mixing-room, joyously dark; and you may handle the doughcakes to make sure they are pure and clean! No matter if your hands are very dirty, after your sightseeing; the good folk of Monreale will take no particular harm after what they have doubtless experienced at other hands. None the less, as a general thing the interior of a Sicilian paste shop compares favorably with that of an American bakery, and the workers themselves are quite immaculate, with soft, clean, pink hands like a woman\\u2019s. After it comes from the press, the macaroni is cut into six-foot lengths and hung up outside the shop to dry in the sunshine. By the time it has collected sufficient dust and germs to make it stiff - two or three days are usually long enough - it is cut into package lengths and sold. In Southern Italy it often occupies a good part of a roadway, or even hangs over a busy coalyard; but in Sicily both its manufacture and sale are cleaner and more wholesome; and the macaroni made in Termini is famous for its quality. Whether it is something in its manufacture, or some subtle quality of the flour from which it is made, the Sicilian pasta seems generally to have a flavor and a delicacy lacking in the Italian variety. The three juvenile assistants - boys who had the haunting native eyes of soft yet gleaming brown dusk, lustrous as old Marsala wine full of the sun - did not seem in the least to mind the drudgery of turning their endless screw. But while we were handling doughcakes in the black backroom with genial Salvatore, they stopped \\u201ctwisting the twist\\u201d and somehow managed to spread the news throughout the entire village that there were strangers within their gates; and a crowd of small boys, beggars, and others who seemed to have no occupation gathered at the front door, demanding vociferously that they be photographed, chaffing each other and us, and arranging themselves according to their own ideas of a picturesque group. While there was no stately ceremony to welcome us, the freedom of the town was clearly ours after that picture taking. Nobody asked for so much as a copper penny, and gruff, cheery voices called after us heartily: \\u201cBuon viaggio! A rivederci, signori! Good-by! Come back again!\\u201d And Monreale has been branded as a town \\u201cwhose beggars are very importunate!\\u201d Bad as the Sicilian beggars are supposed to be, we experienced less annoyance from them throughout the island than from their pertinacious brethren of Naples and the mainland generally. At the brow of the hill is a terrace garden, the \\u201cEden Restaurant\\u201d - where by all means you must take tea. The little establishment amuses rather than disappoints; and though it scarcely justifies its grandiose title, it commands a view that no doubt suggested the name to its proprietor. Falling away from its feet, the hill cascades down in great billows to the cool green and orange sea of the Conca d\\u2019Oro. And when the trolley car turns the shoulder of the hill, in Palermo - misty and dun in the gathering dark - lights like jewels flash out in scintillating ripples that spread and widen and sparkle as you race down the dusty mountain road, leaving medieval Monreale silent and spectral behind. \\n\\n\\nV PALACES AND PEOPLE \\n\\u201cPalace\\u201d in Italian is a flexible and generic term, and the examples of \\u201cpalaces\\u201d one sees in Sicily give an entirely new sense of the elasticity of the Italian language, and the freedom with which the people use it. Palazzo means really any building or structure of any sort where wealthy, a noble, or a royal family lives now, or ever has lived; and some of these structures are as remarkable for their disreputable appearance as others are for their beauty and richness, resembling nothing in the world so much as American tenement houses. One such is unforgettable - a dingy white, square, four-storied building with green shutters and a large central doorway, owned and occupied by a titled and wealthy family whose members move in the highest society throughout the island. The ground floor is taken up entirely by stables, the servants, and rats as large as kittens. The mezzanine floor above is given over to two insurance companies, whose signs cover a considerable part of their story. Above, the really noble family lives in stately fashion. It was when idling up the Nile that we first met the older son of the family. Becoming friendly on desert and river, the Sicilian confided in me his desire for a northern alliance, readily admitting the difficulty of reconciling his fiery temper with that of any wife he might choose among his own people. \\u201cI\\u2019d like an American,\\u201d he declared, shrugging, \\u201cbut if I can\\u2019t get her, I\\u2019ll take an English girl. With cool northern blood in their veins, my children might well show the virtue and strength which has made you Anglo-Saxons what you are. You see, here in Palermo I am a wealthy man. I am \\u2018Your Grace,\\u2019 \\u2018Your Highness.\\u2019 But in New York or London or Paris I am only one of \\u2018those poor Sicilians.\\u2019 I should like to marry a wife whose income, together with mine, would enable us to live as becomes the nobility in those cities.\\u201d I made as diplomatic a reply as possible, but I am very much afraid that the gentleman left me feeling that Americans are after all a cold and unappreciative people, though he did express a desire to continue the acquaintance in Palermo. When we reached that city, we learned from various sources of the aggravating inhospitality of the romancing nobility, one of whose favorite pleasantries consists of ardent solicitations to foreigners to call, and the presenting of cards which, upon scrutiny, are found to bear either no address or only the Italian legend for \\u201cGeneral Delivery.\\u201d Nevertheless, to our surprise, he called on us the morning after his return from an extended trip through the Holy Land, and learning that we intended to leave the next day, insisted that we drive out with him that afternoon. About three o\\u2019clock we were informed with great \\u00e9clat that \\u201cHis Excellency the Egregious Lord X - \\u201d did us the honor to await us. Ready at the door to bow us out to the emblazoned barouche with its black-liveried coachman and lackey hovered an unsuspected congregation of obsequious hotel employ\\u00e9s. Many of them we had never before seen; none of them had hitherto deigned to notice our daily peregrinations in Gualterio\\u2019s coach of state. But now that one of the dear nobility they reverence almost as much as in medieval times recognized us socially, we were quite plainly persons of consideration. Our splendor, however, was short-lived. We had time only for a swift visit to a handsome club with extensive grounds, to the Caff\\u00e8 Massimo for a taste of its famous green-almond ices, and to the Giardino Inglese for a glimpse at its botanic charms, for we had an engagement for tea at the American Consulate. It had not taken us long to arrive at the conclusion that Consul Bishop was a very Bishop of Consuls, and it was due to his kindly interest and hints that we enjoyed considerable intimacy with the life of the people, and also had a good opportunity to see under actual conditions not only the delights of being a foreign representative of the United States, but also the drawbacks of such a position. Incidentally, it is, generally speaking, both wise and pleasant to introduce one\\u2019s self at the Consulate immediately on arriving in a foreign city where a stay of any length is contemplated. In case any untoward incident should arise later, such acquaintance with the consul would prove of inestimable advantage, and would save unpleasant and wearisome investigations of one\\u2019s right to American citizenship and his character. And if the consul prove, as is now generally the case, a man of parts and charm, the result will prove most happy for the visitor who desires to see and know the best the city can afford. The royal residence in Palermo, rising from the Piazza Vittoria, the highest point in the city, is scarcely more remarkable than many of the private palazzi. Ordinary as Palace and Piazza are now, in medieval times this was the fortified citadel: a place of arms and chivalry, of turrets and bastions, of fortresslike buildings forming the defensive key to the city. But little have Time and the barbarous restorer left. First comes an arcaded court, then two flights of marble stairs, and then room after room, tastelessly over-decorated. One marvels at the dullness of royalties who could so slavishly consent to the stuffy vulgarity of these apartments, when before them was a model in the room declared to have been King Roger\\u2019s own. Its mosaics have faded not a whit in the long centuries; design and color hold soft and true to the walls, and this kingly chamber in its dignity and splendor shames the tawdry display of the monarchs who came after. Time spent in such rooms is wasted. The Cappella Palatina, or royal chapel, is a tiny temple richly embellished with marvelous mosaics, but so smothered by the encroachments of the formless Palace that half its beauty is lost for lack of light. It is not even a structure by itself, but a part of the main building, which King Roger added about 1132 in honor of Saint Peter, to whom he dedicated it. Perhaps, because of its position, or perhaps by design, the nave and aisles were left almost unlighted; but seventy-five feet above, the architect pierced the dome with eight apertures, to flood apse and chancel with a glorious nimbus of sunshine, which finds a fit mirror in gleaming walls inlaid with golden glass. The illumination is, however, confined entirely to the choir save for an hour or so in the morning, when the sidewalks glow with the genius of their artist creators - and fade as one watches into shadowy old tapestry. At first it is a darkly mysterious place, indistinctly peopled by spectral figures on every side. Then slowly, as the eyes habituate themselves to the gloom, out from the mellow background lean strong, stern figures. Saints and angels pray, plead, wing their way across the walls; patriarchs and prophets act out the stirring chronicles of the Old Testament and New. High above the choir and tribune, halved by the circumambient light, a majestic, supramundane figure, cross-crowned with the diadem of supreme sacrifice, holds forth the Book upon whose snowy page blazes the royal message in golden letters that need no flame of fire to bid them shine - \\u2019\\u0395\\u03b3\\u03ce \\u03b5\\u1f30\\u03bc\\u03b9 \\u03c4\\u1f78 \\u03c6\\u1ff6\\u03c2 \\u03c4\\u03bf\\u1fe6 \\u03ba\\u03cc\\u03c3\\u03bc\\u03bf\\u03c5: \\u201cI am the Light of the world.\\u201d The single-mindedness of medieval artists is always astonishing. Anything from the Bible was apparently meet for the walls of this sumptuous house of prayer, which, instead of being a mere bit of florid decorative architecture belonging to the King, is a vivid pictorial history. Very realistic is the scene at Lazarus\\u2019 tomb, where a man, with head turned away, holds his nose with one hand as he tilts the tightly swaddled body to an upright position. A little farther along, on the same wall, the artist represented Jesus being baptized by John the Baptist in a dark stream which flows past in snow white ripples. John is sheltered by a section of bright olive-green wall, and at their feet cherub heads peep through the wavelets. All the figures, though very stiff and formal, as might be expected of work in such intractable material, are admirably done, and the faces in particular are expressively stern and reposeful. Restoration has not harmed the chapel, and both it and its decorations and furniture remain intact - the magnificent mosaic pulpit, in the Lombard style; the giant candelabrum beside it, about fifteen feet high, a superb piece of pure Byzantine sculpture with a wealth of mythological details, which strikes a strange pagan note in this Christian church; and the stalactite ceiling, carved wood of the best period of Saracenic workmanship, much after the style of the ceilings of the Alhambra at Granada. The Saracen glorified it with magnificent star-shaped coffers, geometrical designs, Cufic lettering - his religion allowed him no image of anything in heaven above or the earth beneath - and the less prescribed Norman placed his saints and virgins in the divisions of the stars. Yet the work was done with such rare skill - so thoroughly were the Saracens artists first and Mohammedans afterward - that nowhere is there a clash of motive or execution. It fills one with the delight of the East, the subtle perception of masses of color shaded and mellowed by time. That, unfortunately, cannot be said of Palermo\\u2019s other royal residence, the little Summer palace of La Favorita, built by the Bourbon King Ferdinand IV under the shoulder of Monte Pellegrino, and evidently his conception of a Chinese nobleman\\u2019s residence. Striking a jangling note of color in the landscape, it stands boldly forth a great rubricated initial upon the green and gold of the smiling Conca d\\u2019Oro. Surely there never was such another freak of royal fancy! In their search for the bizarre, King Ferdinand\\u2019s architects and decorators succeeded in cramming into one architectural nightmare the styles of a dozen realms and epochs; and the result is a queer hodge-podge of no artistic value, but of mirth-provoking interest to the traveler. Only Mr. Kipling\\u2019s famous phrase can describe it - \\u201cA sort of a giddy harumfrodite!\\u201d In the King\\u2019s suite, Japanese artisans may have decorated the bedchamber, some forgotten artist from hundred-gated Thebes the ceiling of the anteroom, and then with supreme disregard for these exotic effects, the royal humorist - if he were such! - must have turned over the beautifying of his dressing room to a commonplace decorator of modern times, and permitted him to do his worst. The dining table, a huge circular affair, is the pi\\u00e9ce de r\\u00e9sistance of the whole palace. Nothing queerer - or more entirely up-to-date and practical - has ever made its appearance in the most recently constructed American houses. Standing upon a massive cylindrical shaft that runs straight through to the kitchen in the basement, the table is a sort of combination dumbwaiter-quicklunch counter. At each place a silver tray, imbedded in a small shaft, connects below with the main trunk, and these trays, operated automatically with the larger central charger, answer djinn-like by serving a whole course at once, smoking hot, when the royal host rubs the button at his place. Slow eaters might find it somewhat disconcerting to turn from conversation back to - an empty black hole before them! But perhaps King Ferdinand was not a joker. Every room has some freakish combination peculiarly its own, some in Turkish, Arabic or Pompeiian motives, and one huge reception salon in hand-painted silk with Chinese mandarins in full ceremonial costume upon the walls. Above all are the luxurious smoking and lounging rooms, and of course, a wide, tiled veranda on each floor affording sweeping views on either hand. To the Sicilian in his blissful ignorance, La Favorita appears a masterpiece, the people generally regarding the ch\\u00e2teau with the reverence of simplicity. Indeed, poverty and ignorance are the mainsprings of life for a majority of the people. Nor is ignorance confined to the masses. A Sicilian doctor in Palermo, himself graduated from one of our greatest universities and therefore an exception to the rule, told me in all seriousness that a majority of the \\u201csociety people\\u201d of the capital could read nothing more difficult than the daily papers. \\u201cThey often forget how to spell their own names\\u201d - you don\\u2019t wonder much at that when you see some of the names! - \\u201cand their notions of first aid in sickness or injury are barbarous and medieval. When my wife and I first began to practise in Palermo, we tried to help the people with clubs and societies of a semi-educational nature. But we had to drop it all. You can\\u2019t begin education with the adults.\\u201d This was recognized a century ago by one of the foremost patriots of Sicily, the Prince of Castlenuovo, who was one of the prime movers in lifting his island out of the medievalism of Ferdinand\\u2019s r\\u00e9gime. Out in this region of the suburbs - known as I Colli (The Tops), and dotted with splendid villas - and not far distant from Ferdinand\\u2019s Favorita, the Prince established a model farm, kitchen garden and dairy where the boys of both rich and poor families are taught by experts how to get the most out of the ground without having recourse to the antiquated methods of their forefathers. And if one may judge from the attitude of the young students and the eagerness with which they display their knowledge, the big Institute is still proving most successful. The boy who showed us about said proudly that when he finished his schooling he was to be overseer of a big plantation up country, much like the one spreading around us. America had no attractions for him. In his own words: \\u201cMy father has taught me to love Sicily very much, signore. He makes much money in his business in N\\u2019ova York. But I will be patriot. I stay here. I study. By and by I can help my poor country to grow rich!\\u201d Gardens and boys are interesting, but the stockyards of the school are a revelation. Goats and kids, sheep and lambs, magnificent bulls and kine and soft-eyed, frisky little calves have each their separate yards, all immaculate; and in the neat brick addition to the cow-stables is a model piggery comfortably full of grunters, who seem to appreciate quarters where a fresh handkerchief dropped in an occupied pen can be recovered quite unsoiled. The school dairy is as complete as it is wholesome and clean; but you are not likely to go far outside until another phase of the milk industry appears - a donkey carrying large jute panniers full of goats\\u2019-milk potcheese, or ricotta fresca. The whey oozing from the bags and the donkey\\u2019s sweat gather a crust of dust over all. Don\\u2019t manifest a talkative interest - unless you wish to have the peasant merchant urge you to try \\u201cjust a taste, signori!\\u201d Among the splendid estates of I Colli, the Villa Sofia is one of the finest, and the genius of its creator, a wealthy Briton named Whitaker, shows what may be accomplished by perfect taste when man and Nature work together harmoniously to draw the most and best from the breast of the warm and generous earth. Villa, by the way, is almost as flexible a term in Italian as palace. It means not merely a house for summering, but grounds as well as mansion; and many of the houses quite equal the so-called palaces. Another estate worthy a visit is the Villa of the late Count Tasca - this is out Monreale way - who laid out the grounds as an experimental agricultural station, and who was one of the first men in Sicily to farm on a scientific basis. But he dearly loved royalty, too. On the \\u201cbasement\\u201d door of the house a bronze tablet impressively records with a wealth of adjectives the fact that Queen (Dowager) Margharita once took luncheon here with the delighted owner, and that ever since the premises have had an added value and charm because of her Majesty\\u2019s visit. Occupying the monastery of the suppressed and exiled Filippini monks, the Palermo Museum - a vivid epitomization of all Sicily\\u2019s various periods and renascences of art and culture - is given a distinct character of its own by the crumbling though palatial home housing it, worthier far to be called a palace than many of the palazzi of the nobility. You are apt to be disappointed on entering, however, when the courteous guardian of the gate informs you that you will be \\u201cpermitted\\u201d to leave your cameras with the incumbrance clerk across the entrance hall. In vain you plead, catching sight of some of the untrammeled beauties of the first courtyard just beyond. But the guard is uncompromisingly honest; you enter in without so much as the moral support of a sunshade. The little court is a veritable wild Eden. Flowering vines drip down over the edges of the walls and twist about the pillars; a single prickly pear rears its fat donkey-cars above the cornice and glories in the sunshine; great bursts of foliage clothe in green the joints of the corners. In the center of the courtyard a low stone fountain basin full of brilliant plants affords a picturesque foothold for a sixteenth century Triton drinking deep from a conch. And over on the left, just beyond the archway that gives an entrancing vista of the second court beyond, a tender vine wreathes completely about the tragic column topped with a cross of iron from the Piazza dei Vespri, in which it once stood to mark the spot where some of the French who fell in the massacre were buried. Sidewalks and columns, cornice and roof are a museum in themselves, decorated with quaint bits of ancient and medieval architecture, some actually built in as parts of the cloister, others arranged in artistic abandon about the shade-dappled walks. But why puzzle out ancient inscriptions on crumbling marbles when the second court beckons, like a coquettish woman, from the stern lines of the archway? Shake off the persistent employ\\u00e9 who offers to be your mentor, and pass through into a tropical palm garden where the luxuriance of the foliage almost hides the antiquities. No attempt has been made to curb the riotous propensities of the plants. Palm tree and shrub, flowers in beds and rows, vines and creepers give the brilliant court the air of a Spanish patio. But you have really come to see the antiquities, and gradually getting back your sense of proportion, you look about. Directly before you is a queer, somewhat battered thing of dark stone, looking more like a bathtub than anything else. It proves to be a sarcophagus; one of the rare prehistoric Sikel monuments, of inestimable value in studying the customs and culture of the vanished people, whom the Greeks so effectually absorbed that the only trace we have of their mode of life is in a few such scattered pieces as this from the tombs, though even these are often of doubtful authenticity. Papyrus reeds, descendants of the paper-plants imported into Sicily long centuries ago by some forgotten Arab, rear their puffball heads from the fountain, a little grove of living feather dusters. Who knows but that the thrifty Saracen caretaker may have used them to dust out his immaculate mosques and public baths? So varied and comprehensive a collection as the Museum contains has required consummate skill and taste to arrange coherently, and throughout the entire building the director, Professor Salinas, has done his work so admirably that each group\\u2019s significance is fully apparent. In the various halls are quaint old pictures and triptyches so ugly that their very repulsiveness spells the perfect expression of the art of their time, marvelous coins which gave Sicily the reputation of leading the world in numismatics during the Greek era, and most important of all, the metopes. Carven slabs from the temple friezes - what a story they tell of the primitive and ardent culture of the early Greeks perched upon their twin hills at Selinus, beside the sounding deep! One whole hall is lined with them, arranged symmetrically in series, speaking even to-day with the voice of that mystic lore which, to understand, reveals ancient Sicily. And though individual carvings excel them in precision and beauty, as a series denoting the exact progress of Greek Sicilian art from its crudest to its most perfected form, the metopes are unsurpassed. Moreover, these metopes from the temples of Selinus recall a story so tragic, so amazing, that comparisons fail and mere words avail little to picture its horror. Selinus was still young, and the wealthy and expanding Selinuntines were still engaged in building their tremendous temples in 409 B.C. when Hannibal Gisgon with his Carthaginians fell upon the city with a ferocity that is even yet appalling in its details, butchering the inhabitants ruthlessly, and expunging the city from the book of the living. But Hannibal was in a hurry. He had no time to spare to destroy structures of such problematical value as unfinished temples, since he purposed to avenge the defeat and death of his grandfather, Hamilcar, at Himera on the north shore of the island. Giving the temples and the desolate city over to the owl and the locust, he hurried northward, flushed and confident. So it was that the partially completed homes of the bright gods remained until the shock of earthquake hurled them crashing down into chaos. Centuries elapsed in the silence of desolation before the metopes, which Freeman so aptly calls \\u201cthe choicest offerings Selinuntine piety could offer the immortal gods,\\u201d were picked carefully by the arch\\u00e6ologists from the ruins and ranged upon the plaster walls of the Museum, showing the evolution of the art from the weird, uncouth shapes of the earlier metopes to the finished later shapes of gods and heroes and men. Yet so rapid was the development of the sculptors that within a century the first metopes had become curiosities, and the later work so superior it is hard to realize it was produced in the same age. And one cannot but wonder what might have been the fullest flower of this strong, budding genius at Selinus, had not the insatiable African smitten it with his blighting breath of war. One palace that has fallen upon evil days, after as picturesque a past as any building in the island can boast, is the lofty home of the Barons of the Chiaramonte. In the fourteenth century, during the Aragonese period, these and other nobles became so powerful that no systematic administration of Sicily by the government was possible, and the palace - usually called Lo Steri - is an excellent manifestation of the Chiaramonte power. Grim and stiff outside, it still preserves within something of the magnificence of the days when knights in armor clanked through its lofty halls and ladies in quaint headdresses and billowing skirts peeped through the folds of the arras and tapestries to watch the wheels of intrigue and government go round. Many a dark tale could these old halls tell. Andrew Chiaramonte, the last of his line to rule, was dragged hence to the block in 1392, and the palace became the court, with justice taking the place of chicanery. Later on the Spanish viceroys made it their official residence, and in 1600 it became the seat of the dreaded Spanish Inquisition. In the inner courtyard is the private chapel, where no doubt many of the Inquisition\\u2019s bitter and fruitless tragedies had their inception. The whole structure smells of blood. To-day, as the Dogana, or Custom House, it is as useful as ever - and for the Sicilian importer no doubt still a palace of most unpleasant inquisition. King William the Bad, King Roger\\u2019s son, and father of William II, the Good - who built the Cathedral of Monreale - called his favorite palace in Arabic La Zisa, the Beloved or the Splendid. It is of distinctly Moorish character - bare walls unrelieved by projecting decorations of any sort, with Oriental doorways, pointed-arch windows, and a heavy battlemented frieze. In King William I\\u2019s time the palace eunuchs were almost as powerful as they were at Constantinople, and most of the palace officials were Saracens, which is perhaps one reason for the architecture of the structure. William himself lived the idle, sensual life of a voluptuary, and toward the end of his reign, with Oriental indifference, shut himself up in his splendid house and refused any bad news. It is not hard to see in the mutilated grandeur of the main hall why he fell a victim to the insidious charm of the East, for more than any other place in Palermo this chamber breathes of \\u201cAraby the blest.\\u201d The ceiling is a great stalactite vault: a little fountain still bubbles down over steps of mosaic; and it runs across the floor through square pools exactly as do those other similar fountains in the Alhambra at Granada. Only the frescoes on the walls are modern, replacing ancient panels of marble which once embellished the villa. No - there was one other modern touch: a flock of tiny white wax ducks, belonging to the caretaker\\u2019s little daughter, bobbing serenely about in the rippled pool! \\n\\n\\nVI THE PLAIN OF PANORMOS \\nA short distance outside the Porta Sant\\u2019\\u00c1gata - one of the southern gates - on the edge of the rolling Conca d\\u2019Oro, is the Campo di Santo Spirito or cemetery, a lovely greensward full of curious tombs and graves and vaults. Its chapel is old and bare, a relic of the Cistercian monastery established on the same spot in 1173 by Archbishop Walter of the Mill, the English mentor of King William the Good. Doubtless the Archbishop had much to do with the King\\u2019s goodness, since his father was William the Bad. When the church was restored in 1882, the greatest care was taken to preserve at least the spirit of the prelate\\u2019s design, with the result that among these Sicilian graves under the matchless blue of the Sicilian sky there stands an English church of the Middle Ages. Close beside it on the 31st of March, 1282, just at the tap of the bell for evening prayer, began the terrible massacre of the Sicilian Vespers, while in the city near by the great bell of San Giovanni boomed out the knell of all the Frenchmen in the island and the downfall of the heartless House of Anjou. Many of the French who perished in that orgy of slaughter have been buried here. This massacre has often been declared a premeditated rising, but it was really a popular spontaneous outbreak which began at the vesper hour on Easter Tuesday. The church of the Santo Spirito was then a favorite place for worship, and the people on this occasion were moving quietly between it and the city when some two hundred Frenchmen appeared among them, and alarmed the natives greatly by their more than usually offensive remarks and bearing. In the throng was an attractive young Sicilian woman with her lover. Unprovoked, a French soldier addressed an insulting remark to her. Her escort naturally resented this, and instantly all the bitter ignominy and the wrongs the patient islanders had endured at the hands of their French oppressors boiled over. Though practically unarmed, the Sicilians attacked the French so fearlessly that of the two hundred present, not a single one escaped. The church bells sounded a wild alarm, and yelling \\u201cMorte ai francesi! Death to the French!\\u201d the blood-maddened mob streamed back into town, killing on sight, storming palaces and houses, and dispatching even those Sicilians known or suspected to have friendly relations with the Angevins. Brief as the struggle in Palermo was, no less than two thousand French perished; and the brand the Palermitans had kindled swept its fiery way through the island until every Frenchman was either dead or a fugitive. And though the War of the Vespers that followed this summary vengeance lasted for years, the rule of the House of Anjou was over so far as Sicily was concerned. Farther out from the city the beautiful precincts of the old Minorite monastery and church of Santa Maria di Ges\\u00f9 ramble along the steep side of one of those emerald hills that bound the Conca d\\u2019Oro. Long pebbled paths lead up from the gate through cool green vistas dotted with stately trees and headstones; and, with a pride which is the more curious in a Minorite - whose pledges are of humility and poverty - the monk who lets one in explains that this cemetery has never been used by any except the wealthiest of Palermo\\u2019s noble families. Many of the graves are decorated with huge wreaths of artificial flowers in dishpan-like tin cases, glass-covered and frequently containing faded photographs of the deceased, the men appearing very stiff and uncomfortable in their best clothes, tall collars, and derby hats. Some of the \\u201cpans\\u201d are a yard in diameter by about eight inches deep, the wreaths draped with plentiful streamers of black upon which are stamped in gold letters suitable inscriptions and the names of the departed. The monks were chanting sleepily in a choir gallery as we entered the sacristy of the little church, to examine some interesting unfinished cartoons upon the walls for frescoes never executed - our guide an amazing friendly young brother whose face was a replica of Giotto\\u2019s unforgettable fresco of Dante in the Florence Bargello. Fra Giacomo, he called himself; and his interest in the world generally, his simple attitude of dangerous curiosity in everything not connected with the cloistered life, made us think of Hichens\\u2019 sorry hero - if hero he could be called! - in the \\u201cGarden of Allah.\\u201d Neither he, nor any of the other monks with whom we came into contact anywhere in either Sicily or Italy, had the spiritual austerity that is so marked a characteristic of the Spanish monk; nothing at all of the bearing or atmosphere that instantly stamps a man as either genuinely consecrated or fanatic - according to the eye with which he is seen. This lack of spirituality came out strongly when, wholly ignoring the service going on, Fra Giacomo dragged a confessional with a dreadful clatter across the tiled floor to serve as a camera-stand from which he insisted that I photograph the poor, bare little altar with its tawdry image beneath in a glass case. At each outburst of the rasping din, the monks aloft - seemingly quite undismayed by the sacrilege - kindly sang with greater zeal that they might not hear our profane noises. From the monastery a zig-zag path leads to the very top of the hill, where two once highly venerated female saints had an altar and a hermitage on a fine bit of bluff overlooking the Conca d\\u2019Oro. Here the country unfolds below like a huge military map, the roads written with white ink, the sea in sapphire, the Conca d\\u2019Oro in emerald and topaz, and the city in agate. Far in the distance, beyond Palermo, Monte Pellegrino looms soft and vague, its square shoulders half hidden in bluish haze, with the sea fading so delicately into the sky that often the horizon line is lost. Nestling among the lemons in the foreground are large chimneys, the sign visible of an irrigation system nearly a thousand years old, of Saracenic origin. Hills and plain alike murmur with flowing water, for wherever the Arab went he turned barrens into gardens, planted and tended and improved, and devised irrigation systems so complete and permanent that - considering his resources and the times - our own watering schemes in the West seem puerile and scattering. To-day in the Conca d\\u2019Oro about an hundred steam engines pump up water from artesian wells and subterranean rivers, while conduits and water-wheels utilize every drop that issues from the springs. So fertile is the soil that this irrigation has increased the yield from seven to one hundred and fifty dollars an acre. There seems to be something in the atmosphere of the Ges\\u00f9, some subtle ether of sympathy, perhaps, that makes the visitor\\u2019s presence on the hill known to all the children round. At any rate, they pop out of the earth, and as you come down from the hermitage at the very top of the step to the main buildings, you are pretty certain to hear a scratching noise on the low stone wall at one side of the road. Naturally you look over. At the cleft upper end of a long pole a spray of lemon blossoms scrapes along the rough wall; at the lower end, some twenty-five feet below in a grove, an attractive child clamors to you for \\u201cDue soldi mangiare - Two cents, to eat!\\u201d As we were leaving the monastery, \\u201cDante\\u2019s\\u201d interest in worldly affairs came out strongly once more. Pointing to my camera, he asked plaintively: \\u201cHave you a plate left for me?\\u201d I let him choose his own pose and his own background. With the skill of an artist he selected a stone step flanked by lofty cypresses, and taking out his breviary immediately lost himself in meditation which required some imagination to consider holy. The photograph made, he spoke again, his wistful expression intensified. \\u201cNow will you please register the package? Many tourists have been here and taken pictures, several of myself. They all promised to send me copies. I know they did so,\\u201d he sighed regretfully, with a charity which would have been ludicrous had it not been so childishly unaffected and sincere, \\u201cbut I never got a single one. Oh, but the mails are bad here!\\u201d Genial Gualterio, for all his eagerness to serve us to our best advantage, could not forget his own advantage once in a while, and cheerily singing on his box, drove us far out of our way, at last drawing rein before the mouth of a large cavern which appeared to be full of very dirty children whose hands were full of very dirty bones. On the other side of the road lay a pool covered with green slime. I was getting out with my camera when Gualterio stopped me abruptly. \\u201cOh, no, signore, there is nothing worth examining; but I thought you might like to see the Giants\\u2019 Cave, which is full of old fossils, and the Mar\\u2019 Dolc\\u2019!\\u201d No visitor is likely to be thirsty enough to drink of the \\u201csweet water\\u201d that reminds him of Gunga Din and his goatskin bag. It is to be hoped, moreover, that the slimy pool is only the overflow of the Mare Dolce (Sweet Water), most famous of the Conca d\\u2019Oro\\u2019s innumerable springs. Neither is one likely to speculate in bones of doubtful authenticity. So the only thing to do under the circumstances is to be just as cheerful as the cabman, and drive back to the ruins of the old Saracen-Norman stronghold of La Favara, whose splendor was famous during the Middle Ages, for there Frederick II, greatest of all kings of Sicily, held royal court. The brilliant court has vanished, and the castle itself is a crumbling wreck, a mere dank stable and storehouse, dark and ill smelling. Yet merely to see it recalls Frederick\\u2019s striking personality and character. And it is to be remembered that he was not merely Emperor of Germany and King of Sicily, but King of Italy, Sardinia, Apulia, Burgundy and for a while of Jerusalem. His connection with that city and with the Sixth Crusade forms one of the most picturesque and pleasant incidents of that fierce and warlike age. Speaking Arabic fluently - besides several other languages - he was able, through sheer force of character and winning personality, to negotiate treaty after treaty with the Saracens peacefully, winning the Holy City itself without striking a blow, and remaining its king for a decade during which peace instead of bloodshed was the rule. His army even contained a picked body of Saracen troops which he made his personal bodyguard. There was nothing, in fact, in either the intellectual or the political life of his age which this man, described by the Latin chroniclers as stupor mundi, \\u201cwonder of the world,\\u201d failed to grasp and master thoroughly. And in all the whirl of his incessant activities at home and abroad he found time to be a poet and scholar, to encourage learning in all its branches, and, most important of all, to articulate and reduce to written form the crude Italian speech of the day. If you care for an experience out of the usual in this smiling island, stop on the Bagheria road at the church of San Giovanni dei Lebrosi or, as some Americans call it, \\u201cThe Leprosy,\\u201d in the midst of a settlement of tanners. Here you are attended by three women, each flourishing a large key, all dirty and unkempt, and a barking, snapping, currish crowd of begging children. One of the three women unlocks the door of the alley at whose inner end the church stands. The stench is almost stupefying, the air thick with vapors. The second woman opens the door of the church, one of the oldest Norman structures in the island, now painfully restored with obtrusive brick and whitewash, and the third proves to be the keeper of the sacristy. Still another huge key now appears - this time in the hands of a surly man, who insists on showing you out another way, through an orange grove, though your carriage is in plain sight at the foot of the lane. These evil-looking children and caretakers are the most pertinacious and insolent you will encounter anywhere in the island. Has the fetid atmosphere anything to do with their crabbed humor? In this plain of ancient Panormos, as both city and district were once known, there comes vividly to mind a curious battle scene. To-day we experiment with automobiles and aeroplanes as instruments of war: more than two thousand years ago disaster overtook the arms of Carthage because General Asdrubal placed his reliance in the then new-fangled elephant auxiliaries. Rome, for all she was conquering the world, trembled before these \\u201cgreat gray oxen,\\u201d as the legionaries called them. However, the Consul Metellus, who commanded inside the city, directed his attention effectually first of all to these splendid targets moving ponderously and disdainfully up against him. Pain-maddened by a ceaseless shower of darts and arrows, the great beasts shook off their helpless drivers and charged furiously to and fro, trumpeting, goring, trampling, wild engines of destruction which did more mischief to the Carthaginians than to Rome; and before night fell over the field of slaughter, the Romans led captive more than half of the hundred and twenty once dreaded Titans that had been Asdrubal\\u2019s reliance, but which had cost him the battle. Continuing toward the city along the road called the Corso dei Mille, over which Garibaldi and his immortal Thousand marched to victory, we pass close beside the old Ponte d\\u2019Ammiraglio, built some eight hundred years ago by King Roger\\u2019s Grand Admiral Giorgios Antiochenos. In those days it spanned the swift Fiume Oreto, but now the fickle water has chosen another bed, leaving the massive stone bridge high and dry, and looking very useless and absurd in an open field. Entering the town by the Garibaldi Gate - the liberator is even more frequently honored than the first King - we follow Garibaldi Street to the Piazza della Rivoluzione, in which a queer, old, bent, apparently half-intoxicated figure of the crowned Genius of Palermo marks the spot where the first revolutionists gathered twelve years before the Thousand captured the city. Near by in the Piazza della Croce dei Vespri is the monument in memory of the French massacred in 1282, and buried here beneath a single marble column surmounted by a cross and surrounded by a railing of lances and halberds. At the corner of the square, built in a housewall, is a single fifteenth century column, marking the site of the palace in which Governor St. Remy, who was the lieutenant of Charles of Anjou at the time of the massacre, lived and is said to have been besieged. From the railroad station a broad street, the Via Lincoln, leads to the bay. Gualterio volunteered the information that the street, \\u201cla Via Lin-col-ni,\\u201d was named for a \\u201cgreat Sicilian patriot who was shot long before we were born!\\u201d It would have been a pity to disillusion him and rob Sicily of so great a figure, so we kept a smiling silence. Beside the bay is an exquisite little park with broad lawns, splendid trees and paths laid out like the spokes of a huge floral wheel; one of the most perfect gardens in Sicily. It is called Villa Giulia, in honor of Donna Giulia Guevara, wife of the viceroy, Marcantonio Colonna, who founded it in 1777. The gardener\\u2019s little boy, a cherub of soft black eyes and winsome smile, afforded another striking proof of the beneficent effects of education upon the children. Announcing proudly that he was learning to be a gardener himself, he flitted from flower to flower like an amorous bee, fondling, smelling, praising each burgeon in turn, and naming the plants with a perfect flood of Latin botanical terminology. It was in this lovely park that Goethe spent a great deal of time during a Sicilian sojourn in 1789, reading Homer and seeing the Villa\\u2019s beauties with so sympathetic an eye, he wrote of it that it looked like fairyland and transported him into ancient times. His Italienische Reise is particularly enthusiastic on Sicily, and he sums up the island\\u2019s importance with a glowing tribute: \\u201cItaly without Sicily leaves no image in the soul - Sicily is the key to all.\\u201d In clear weather a large raised terrace at the southeast corner of the Villa affords a peep at distant \\u00c6tna\\u2019s hoary crown. But if the weather be too hazy to see the Titan, the nearer view compensates in great measure for the invisible volcano. To the southeast the \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s promenade\\u201d stretches away in a misty vista toward Monte Zaffarano. The fishing boats tie up here, and the fishermen and their families make merry over their early suppers at open-air tables in the dusty, unpaved square that extends inland from the broad and level beach. In the other direction the broad Foro Italico or Marina, a handsome, tree-lined esplanade circumscribing the edge of the bay, with Monte Pellegrino rising massive and dominant at the other end of the town, miles away, affords a striking contrast. This is the \\u201crich man\\u2019s promenade,\\u201d and here, in summer, Fashion makes its evening corso. Half Palermo sits in its iron-bottomed chairs sipping at the ices and cool drinks for which the caf\\u00e9s are noted, and smoking countless sigaretti, while the other half rolls lazily by in its carriages of state. From the Villa Giulia a line of old palaces marks the landward side of the Marina all the way down to the foot of the Corso, at its other extremity. Many of them belong to nobles whose names are woven deep into some of Sicily\\u2019s most important history. Down near the Porta Felice - the Happy Gate - a little wooden pavilion juts boldly out into the sea, a combination library and tearoom, whose presiding genius is an English gentlewoman, charming of speech and manners. No pleasanter way of resting after a hard day\\u2019s work sightseeing can be found than to sit here over cups of steaming Ceylon, while the sea shimmers an iridescent opal, ruffled with streaky little ripples of protest for the approaching night. And afterward what more fitting than to re\\u00ebnter Eden by the Happy Gate - the Porta Felice - named as a memorial of the Lady Felice Orsini, wife of the Viceroy who built it. Happy Lady Felice, to have such a monument - and porta felice in truth, looking one way out over the sparkling sea and the other upon the city beautiful. \\n\\n\\nVII AROUND THE ISLAND \\nFascination and Palermo are synonymous; the subtle charm of the city works into one\\u2019s very blood. Day after day and week after week roll by, until with a start of surprise that is akin to consternation one realizes that unless he has a year to devote to the island he must seek fresh vistas soon or leave Sicily, having seen nothing but the capital. Regretting is as vain as it is foolish. The only thing to do is to go! Until you do, you have no idea of what the tessere - those amazing little bargain books - do for the Sicilians. Not only do they bring foreigners with money to spend, but natives of every class and station, unable to travel at other seasons of the year, flock to the ticket window with the tessere in their hands; and many of them who ordinarily would travel third class make a festa of their trips by buying first-class accommodations with the aid of the rebate. There is no Pullman system in Sicily. The first arrivals at the station take the best seats, and hold them against all comers. If you do not like cheap tobacco, and do like air, it is a good plan to reach the station early. All this we learned by experience; so we were ready to leave Palermo some time before the train was, and secured a little stateroom called a berlina, in the front of the car, whence an unobstructed view on both sides is to be had. Scarcely is the capital left behind than it is completely forgotten in the astonishing floral display that flashes past - an unending motion-picture in vivid colors. For miles the track runs close beside the sea between deep floral hedges. Crimson geraniums from five to eight feet in height blazing with color, pink wild roses, sweet-scented white locust blossoms, spiky prickly pear, the yellow striped spears of the agave, and pink and lavender morning glories vining among and over them all give one the impression of being hurled through a giant hot-house. But here is no cultivation. Sicilian Nature, with prodigal lavishness, is alone responsible for the brilliant pageant. At the feet of the taller plants burgeon scarlet poppies, low, earth-nestling lavender cactus blossoms, and legions of dazzling buttercups. More poppies among the grass and grain contrast with whole acres of heavy-headed deep crimson clover, in which the hungry cattle wade to their knees. On the landward side of the railroad undulate the hills in soft nuances of green, speckled and flecked with ever-changing light and shade. Farmhouses massively built of rough unshaped stone, because the stone is there and mortar is cheap and the labor costs nothing, stand at long intervals among the golden grain square and squat, each with a heavy Normanesque battlemented tower. The poorer houses barely show their roofs or towers above the dense groves of lemon or orange. Sometimes part of a white wall appears through the bushy tree foliage, which is varied by occasional wide stretches of vines on low, far-reaching trellises, over which stands a slim-bodied palm, an alert, lonely sentinel. The sea shimmers like glass in the gay sunlight, and even from the rapidly moving train the bottom is visible, sometimes ten or fifteen feet below the surface. White stones and deep purple patches of weed lie like pearls and amethysts imbedded in the heart of the cool emerald. Tiny reefs, far from their islets, and big, jagged rocks show their teeth at the ragged coast line through fringes of snowy foam. Ever shifting car-window prospects float by on the wing, and before you can fairly appreciate one, you pass another. Around a curve, the train dashes into a big fishing village, a sturdy hamlet of nets and boats, of men in bare legs and knitted caps with tassels, of houses packed together on the side of a steep hill, struggling upward like lame sheep; a town of tiles and whitewash huddled together under the protection of a dozen stalwart-steepled belfries - Termini Imerese, busiest of Sicily\\u2019s provincial towns, famous for its macaroni. Here were the celebrated hot springs of Himera, where, legend says, Hercules bathed after his great wrestling match with King Eryx. It is said that the water from these springs gives the macaroni its characteristic flavor. And here Agathocles, the Peter the Cruel of Greek Sicily, was born. A few miles east of Termini the railroad leaves the shore, and turning southward enters the valley of the Torto, to begin climbing the rugged backbone of Sicily; the watershed between the ancient African and Tyrrhenian Seas. We might be in another country and clime, so different is the scenery as we puff on southward, the way bordered on either hand by the ruins of medieval castles and by little mountain towns still living in the Bronze Age. Near Lercara, forty-eight miles from Palermo, the sulphur mining district begins, where the mephitic gases from the smelting furnaces have poisoned and stunted vegetation and herbage, giving everything a ghastly mummified look, besides polluting the keen mountain air with an unmistakable brimstone flavor. At Aragona-Caldare Girgenti first appears, seven miles away, surely \\u201ca city set upon a hill that cannot be hid.\\u201d Yet to-day it is no more like the ancient Greek Akragas, founded twenty-five centuries ago, than the dried sponge is like the live one. All that is left of this richest and most splendid of Sicilian metropoli is huddled within the confines of its former acropolis, high on the top of the hill. The greater city, which spread clear down to the temples that fringe the abrupt southern edge of the plateau, has vanished completely, and the bright homes of the gods, crumbled into mellow ruin, stand alone beside the shattered wall, in the midst of the everlasting beauty of hill and plain. In its palmy days - which began after the battle of Himera and lasted until the Carthaginian siege - Akragas was so wealthy and so filled with splendor that the record is almost incredible. The Akragantines\\u2019 flasks and body-scrapers, for use in the baths, were of gold and silver, their beds of ivory, their feasts and celebrations magnificent. At the wedding of the daughter of Antisthenes, one of the two leading citizens, there were eight hundred chariots in the wedding procession, every single citizen was feasted, and the whole city seemed ablaze from the smoke and flame of the innumerable bonfires. Even more noted was the hospitality of Gellias. His slaves stood always at every gate of the city, to bid all who came thither welcome as his guests. Once, indeed, he even entertained - clothed, lodged and fed - five hundred cavalrymen and their horses. And, as Freeman says, these men, Antisthenes and Gellias alike, were neither tyrants nor lords nor oligarchs, but simple citizens of the democracy. The main source of the city\\u2019s wealth was her trade with Carthage, especially in the grape and the olive, neither of which grew in Africa at that time. Evidently, though, the grapes were not all sent to Carthage, for Tim\\u00e6us tells us that a house in the city was nicknamed the \\u201cTrireme\\u201d because some young men of fashion got very drunk there one night, and imagining they were in a reeling, rolling ship at sea, began throwing the furniture overboard to lighten the laboring craft. When the generals of the Commonwealth came rushing in to quiet things down, the drunken boys mistook them for gods of the raging sea, and prayed them to calm the storm! Empedocles, one of Akragas\\u2019s most famous sons, laments that his fellow townsmen \\u201cgave themselves to delights as if they would die to-morrow, while they built their houses as if they were going to live forever.\\u201d Little did these luxury-loving folk think that the very barbarians whose trade was so enriching them would at last grow envious and snatch back by force the wealth they had built up for their neighbors. Empedocles, by the way, is one of the most picturesque characters in the whole story of Sicily. A political leader and an engineer who did wonders for the sanitation of the city, he refused supreme control when he might have had it, and proclaimed himself a sort of primitive socialist early in his career. But later in life he seems entirely to have forgotten his previous socialistic theories. Dressed in a purple robe with a golden girdle, brazen shoes, and a Delphic wreath for his thick hair, he wandered from city to city proclaiming himself, in the words of one of his own poems, the Katharmoi, \\u201cAn immortal god, and no longer a mortal man.\\u201d Nearly a sixth of Sicily\\u2019s sulphur is exported from Porto Empedocle, Girgenti\\u2019s ancient haven, six miles distant. From the station platform one sees all around reddish-yellow and gray hills covered with small dumps and pierced with scores of drives, dotted with little shanties and pricklied over with chimneys where the miners are delving and smelting. On the sidings near the depot scores of flat cars are heaped high with huge pressed cakes of the sickly greenish-yellow sulphur, while the roadway leading to the freight-house is fulvid with powdered brimstone, and the atmosphere faintly suggests things infernal. In the city museum the antiquarian may study the tile stamps of the Roman period - Girgenti was Agrigentum then - for impressing the sulphur cakes before they solidified. Outside the station every train draws a barking crowd of facchini (porters) and hotel-runners, from whom you escape into an hotel omnibus. We chose a tiny, rickety, low-roofed vehicle, which had developed rheumatism and gout in every complaining spring and joint. Delighted to secure the only first class passengers who had come on that express, the driver whipped up his three emaciated nags and we started on the long, circuitous, heart-breaking climb up the steep hills to the citadel above. The bus was scarcely moving when a face appeared at the rear door, not of the usual hotel porter who rides behind, but of a Murillo cherub, brown-eyed and dark, with a lurking smile so ingenuous and charming that one must have been stony-hearted indeed not to succumb to the spell of his innocent sorcery. The hotel on the Via Atenea - the only street in Girgenti worthy the name of a thoroughfare - proved a seedy, disreputable looking establishment, giving upon the narrow way in a black hole into which we plunged, to find a pair of winding, cold stone stairs in the rear up which we stumbled to the second story office. But the drawbacks of this inn - and there are better ones in town - were fortunately most of them on the outside. Our room was really comfortable, and the luncheon considerably better than we dared expect, though the dessert, in a dirty glass cake-dish, consisted of oranges, nespoli, or Japanese medlars, large raw broad-beans, and something that looked like celery but proved to be finocchi, or fennel, one of the staple foods of the people, apparently a natural source of concentrated paregoric. When the porter announced that our landau was waiting after luncheon, we questioned the ability of the three mangy, half-starved horses - the same team which had brought us from the railway station - to drive all the afternoon over the amazingly steep and hilly roads; but assured that these very animals had been doing the same work for \\u201ctwenty years or more\\u201d we started off congratulating ourselves on escaping the guides, unnecessary nuisances. As we stepped out at the little antique Gothic church of San Niccol\\u00e0, the cherub suddenly appeared before us. \\u201cHello! Where did you come from?\\u201d I inquired. The lad only shook his head, but the coachman, whose face was all one broad grin, waved his whip at the rear of the carriage. \\u201cA dietro - On behind!\\u201d It was true. For miles that child had clung to the rear axle in the choking dust for the sake of a little silver. With an air of modest assurance he introduced himself - \\u201cAlfonso Caratozzo, signore. I am just twelve years old. For six years I have been the best guide in Girgenti, and all the grand foreign gentlemen are much pleased with me. I can show you everything.\\u201d Alfonso\\u2019s large claim was fully justified by his conduct of our affairs, his poetic appreciation not only of the beauties of the scenery but of his own dignity and importance as counselor and pilot of the forestieri americani - and no one who wishes a guide can do better than to inquire for Alfonso the Wise! Never was the mixed civilization and pagan ancestry of the Sicilians of to-day brought more vividly to our attention than in this little church of San Niccol\\u00e0. The attractive girl custodian was a perfect young Saracen Sicilian, black-eyed and raven haired, with big gold and coral earrings. Beside her Alfonso, as purely Greek as she was Moorish, looked every inch a faun. The girl knew what stories she had to tell very well. Alfonso, however, evidently bored by the history of ancient Akragas from the day of its founding, whispered: \\u201cPay no attention to her, signore. She tells this to everybody!\\u201d Shades of Diodorus - what should she tell! Near by stands a little Roman building dating from the second century B. C. Somehow it got the name of Oratory of Phalaris, though it certainly was not in existence in Phalaris\\u2019s time. How strange that such a building and such an idea should be associated with this most widely advertised of Greek tyrants! Of all the disputed stories told of him, that of the brazen bull is most widely known; and without his bull, Phalaris would be no more than an hundred obscure tyrants in other Greek cities. The legend declares that an artist named Perillos made a monstrous hollow brazen bull in whose shoulder was a door through which the victim could be thrust. When the fire underneath heated the diabolical invention, the cries of the sufferer, issuing through the nostrils, sounded like the roarings of the enraged animal. The tyrant, with a proper sense of humor, immediately tested the efficiency of the image upon its luckless inventor Perillos. In later times apologists denied these stories; but Pindar, writing within a century after the death of Phalaris, summed up Sicilian public opinion of that day very tersely in the lines: \\u201cPhalaris, with blood defiled, His brazen bull, his torturing flame, Hand o\\u2019er alike to evil fame In every clime!\\u201d Very different indeed are his praises of Theron of Akragas, one of the greatest and best of the Greek tyrants, with whom he was contemporary. The Second Olympian Ode is perhaps the most fulsome. Cary rendered it: \\u201cTheron for his conquering car Shall spread a shout of triumph far and wide; True to his friends, the people\\u2019s pride; Stay of Akragas and flower Of many a noble ancestor; They, long toils and perils past, By the rivers built at last Their sacred bower, and were an eye To light the land of Sicily. And I will swear That city none, though she enroll A century past her radiant scroll, Hath brought a mortal man to light Whose heart with love more genial glows, Whose hand with larger bounty flows, Than Theron\\u2019s.\\u201d It was during the reign of Theron that the city, approaching the height of its prosperity and pride, joined forces with Gelon and the Syracusans in defeating Hamilcar\\u2019s Carthaginians in a tremendous battle at Himera. The victors took an immense number of the defeated soldiers captive, and Theron began to rush forward epoch making municipal improvements. The slaves, being only human, could not last forever, and they were worked hard while their strength endured, toiling in the stone quarries, building the city wall, excavating a huge fishpond, and commencing the construction of the magnificent temples along the southern rampart. \\u201cTyrant,\\u201d by the way, in that age of civilization, did not necessarily mean a brutal, oppressive or fire-breathing monster. Indeed, some of the tyrants were among the best rulers Greek Sicily ever had. As Freeman says, \\u201ctyrant\\u201d meant a forceful usurper, a man who raised himself to the supreme authority when kings and kingship were not only unlawful but were not even the fashion. Of the six glorious temples - among the most brilliant achievements of the most brilliant period of Greek freedom in Sicily - only two remain standing, at the verge of the hill, limned in all their marvelous Greek severity and simplicity against the tender landscape. Overhead burns the cobalt sky of Sicily; around them burgeon crimson poppies, delicate buttercups and spurge, and other flowers innumerable. Flute-voiced birds swing and sing in among the olives, in air languid with the perfume of the almond in bloom. - And in the clear sunlight of the South, the temples themselves glow with a golden radiance that must surely be a faint reflection of the fires of the immortal gods. Models of Doric simplicity, these temples consisted only of a windowless shrine for the god, surrounded by an open colonnade, the whole covered by a gabled roof. Their design was at once the result of the climate and of Greek civilization. The religion was intimately connected with devotion to the State; hence the homes of the gods, who were both the patrons and companions of the people, were public buildings, their porticoes open to the daily life and commerce, the intercourse of the citizens. The Greek religion was beautiful, rarely beautiful. But exclusive, mysterious? No! Its rites were simple - choral hymns, rhythmic dances, ceremonies executed by the citizens themselves. And the priests guarded no occult sciences, as did the Egyptians; kept to themselves no written hieroglyph unintelligible except to the initiate. They were laymen, married men with families, soldiers, merchants, men engaged in every walk of life. Marvelous architects, those old fifth century Greeks! To give their low and heavy buildings greater charm than was possible with mere straight lines, they made their columns gently swelling; smaller at the top than at the bottom. At the corners of the edifice they even sloped them slightly inward. They bent the foundation upward a little in the middle, and did the same thing with the long line of the entablature above. Yet it would seem that they were given to gilding the lily. They covered the rich golden travertine of which the edifices were built with a thin coat of white stucco or mortar, upon which were painted striking ornaments in many brilliant colors. It is hard to believe that the temples when painted could have been as magnificent as they are to-day; yet they must have been - who are we to impugn Greek taste! The Temple of Concord, because of its use in the Middle Ages as the church of Saint Gregory of the Turnips, is one of the best preserved pagan buildings in existence, all of its thirty-four giant columns still standing. It makes a picture of beautiful and serene old age that loses nothing by comparison with the eternal youth of its surroundings. House of peace it has been called, and house of peace it still is, after the storms and wars of more than fourteen centuries have ebbed and flowed about its massive base. The custode, a garrulous old soldier, insists on your instantly taking the view from the architrave above the cella, which really is magnificent. But you are not ready for that just yet. Why must these caretakers always tease you to do something when you don\\u2019t want to! Glimpsing the fat little red book in your pocket, he smiles sardonically. \\u201cHa! You wish to be let alone?\\u201d he exclaims. \\u201cHa! You believe the book of a German, not the word of a Sicilian. But does the book tell you the Christians who turned this temple into a church were the first Sicilians to embrace the Faith? No, signore - but you believe your German book. Very good, believe it!\\u201d and he stalks away, secure in his precious tradition. From the Temple of Concord the road ascends gently, parallel to the ancient wall, until it reaches the southeastern angle of the precipitous plateau, occupied by the so-called Temple of Juno. Below it on the east flows the San Biagio, zigzagging in a southwesterly direction to join the Drago torrent, with which it enters the Mediterranean at the old harbor of Emporio. Perched upon this lofty cliff, nearly four hundred feet above the sea, the temple commands a wonderful view. This structure is in far less perfect condition than the Temple of Concord, only twenty-five whole columns standing, while everywhere the mellow golden stonework is marked with peculiar dull, bloody stains supposed to be traces of the fire set by the Carthaginians in 406 B. C., in their endeavor to burn the city. The tradition seems to have little foundation in fact, for on other ruins, parts of the old Greek wall, and even on some of the rocks of the vicinity, the same strange stains are frequently visible, and appear to be a natural property of the stone, possibly due to its exposure to the weather. Here I sent Alfonso away on an errand, and another small boy guide hung about us until we entered the holy of holies. Springing upon a shattered block of marble which he said had been the altar where the huge statue of Juno had once stood, he took an absurdly constrained position, and cried: \\u201cLook, signore - Juno stood here - just like me!\\u201d One of the most alluring ruins is the fragment, called for want of a better name presumably, the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Embayed in a grove of olive and almond, resting upon a veritable carpet of flowers among which climb tangled vines, rise four stately columns, silhouetted sharply against the dazzling sky, and supporting a honey-colored fragment of entablature. And though the arch\\u00e6ologists declare the columns to have been taken from two different edifices and arbitrarily joined, this detracts not a whit from the grace and beauty of the restoration and its surroundings. Olympian Jupiter it was who had - as befitted the king of the gods - the largest temple. Indeed, after the vast temple of Diana at Ephesus, this was the largest Greek shrine ever built. Now all there is to be seen is a vast formless heap of cut stones in a living sea of brilliant yellow bloom. Unafraid, these star-eyed flowerets lovingly enfold shattered column and pediment, creep up into the sacred close of the cella or sanctuary, and kiss the huge prone figure of one of the thirty-eight titanic Atlantides or caryatides, about twenty-five feet in height, which are believed to have supported the entablature. The colossal edifice measured about three hundred and seventy-two feet long, at least one hundred and eight-two wide, and probably about one hundred twenty high. And these are not all, by any means. There are more ruins of temples, within and without the walls, more interesting to explore than to read about; there are Christian catacombs and tombs; the megalithic wall, and the Porta Aurea, the Golden Gate that looks straight out over the golden southern sea. And there are also some very interesting antiquities on view in the Museum - but beware the specious vendors of relics who hang around the temples and the hotels. The Greeks of twenty centuries ago did not stamp their products, \\u201cMade in Germany!\\u201d All along the way are vast numbers of peculiar white lumps on grass and leaves and walls, clinging like burrs to even the fruit and treetrunks. \\u201cThey are snails, Excellency,\\u201d explained Alfonso, \\u201cand very good to eat. After it rains they grow big and fat. Then they are very sweet.\\u201d Springing down from the box, the child tore a fat snail from the wall, and hopping up again, cracked it open skillfully with his teeth, drew out and ate the quivering mollusc. Waving his hand toward some more large specimens on the wall, he asked: \\u201cExcellency would like some too?\\u201d \\u201cExcellency has just had his luncheon,\\u201d opportunely interposed the driver. \\u201cSnails are not good for dessert.\\u201d Within the acropolis again, we dismissed the landau out of pity for the wretched horses, and rambled about on foot. Before reaching the Cathedral we passed Alfonso\\u2019s home, where he introduced us to his family with all the \\u00e9clat of a noble presenting friends at court; and poor as these Sicilians were, we found among them all - father, mother, aunt, cousin, three sisters and a brother - no lack of that inborn courtesy which distinguishes the Latin peasant. Collectively the family showed us the church of Santa Maria dei Greci, in which are supposed to be incorporated the scanty remains of the principal sanctuary of either Zeus Atabyrius or Minerva, while some urchin, locked out and so deprived of all opportunity for tips, playfully stoned the church door. The Cathedral is more interesting, though the apse is over richly stuccoed, covered with scrolls and cherubs in gold and white. One of its chief treasures is a madonna, painted by Guido Reni, though not comparable to his best work. In the sacristy is a really fine old white marble sarcophagus of the Roman period, bearing reliefs of the myth of Hippolytus and Ph\\u00e6dra. But nothing within is comparable to the view from one of the windows at the sunset hour. It recalls the Biblical prophecies of Canaan with the chalky roads for the milk, and the gold of the daisies, mustard and marigolds for the honey of this Promised Land. The chief charm of the scene as the hills lie weltering under the fading glory of the sinking sun are these same milky roads, flowing through the verdant swards and vales. In the background the ugly, prosaic sulphur pits, dumps and chimneys make splashes of harsh modern color in this world-old landscape. It is a scene unforgettable. Slowly, gently, the soft rosy-bluish evening haze creeps up the hillside; bit by bit the purple shadows deepen, the soft harmonies of tender green melt into the blur of the background, and only the creamy highways stand out distinct. Not so very many years ago this entire region was unsafe because of the brigands. Now one may go anywhere about Girgenti with perfect security. Nevertheless, a pair of Carabinieri - they always travel in pairs, by the way - gorgeous in all their glory of black and scarlet, with cockaded cocked hats, were always somewhere within range when we were outside the city proper. They seemed to take as keen an interest in the ruins as we did, though temples must have been an old story to them. Alfonso spoke to one of these kindly familiars whom we passed, struggling to make his greeting as careless as the familiar \\u201cHello!\\u201d of the American streets. Good humoredly the Carabiniero answered him, and as we went on, the boy remarked with innocent egotism: \\u201cYou saw him, signore? He is my friend. You are with me, and he would let nothing happen to you. It is good to know the police - as I do!\\u201d \\n\\n\\nVIII THE ROAD TO SYRACUSE \\nTo the northwest of Girgenti the country is honeycombed with sulphur pits and it is not very hard to credit the ancient myth that the gates of Hades opened here. After the train leaves the trunkline of the railway at Aragona-Caldare, tunnels and sulphur mines make up most of the scenery. This entire district has a smitten look, and on the bleak rolling plains and rugged hills are dreary towns whose chief charm, as they flit past in a continuous gray motion picture, lies in their historical suggestions. The most important and flourishing city we pass is Caltanisetta, the center of the sulphur industry, which produces more than half a million tons annually. The mines are most of them primitive in the extreme, and machinery is practically unknown, while in many of them fuel is so scarce and costly that the operators burn the raw sulphur itself in their calcaroni or smelters. Shortly before reaching Santa Catarina Xirbi, the junction town where the tracks join the Palermo line, we have our first glimpse of Mt. \\u00c6tna, its snowy cap hanging in the distance like a low white cloud. Small gorges and tunnels follow in rapid succession, and the train pants upward in tortuous curves through the barren valleys, until we look up at Castrogiovanni, the Enna of the ancients. It lies in an almost perfect horseshoe on a precipitous rock, and so surrounded by nearly perpendicular approaches, so walled in by Nature with beetling crags, that none of its innumerable ancient besiegers was ever able to storm it. Treachery - and once starvation - did for it what armed assault never could. Livy rightly called it \\u201ca city inexpugnable,\\u201d and it probably is so yet, for it has recently been strongly fortified after the most approved modern style. The ascent is by a road which - well, try it for yourself. But the town, once reached, pays for the climb in its magnificent views. It is the navel (umbilicus Sicili\\u00e6) of Sicily, and from the loftiest tower of the former citadel there sweeps away a mountain cyclorama such as not even Switzerland can excel - \\u00c6tna, peaks without number, range on range and tier on tier, melting into the haze of heaven. Towns, thousands of feet in the air, cling desperately to the steep, unfriendly sides, or perch precariously on the tops of needle-pointed mountains. And on the South, beyond hills and plain, dimples the ultramarine of the African sea. For centuries before the adventurous Greeks colonized the hill, Enna was the principal home of a Sicilian goddess, the patron of natural fertility and of the harvest, whom the Greeks identified with their own Demeter, and the later Romans with Ceres. Not a stone of her temple is left, and we can do little more than speculate upon its site, said to have been where the old citadel now stands. About two hours to the south by carriage is that once lovely little lake of Pergusa, where Pluto met and straight-way stole the lovely Proserpina to be the queen of his dark realm. It was then a district so fair that Diodorus said the hounds often lost the scent of their quarry, so rich was the fragrance of the flowers. But alas! the spot is blasted now. Gone are the splendid shade trees in whose branches the singing messengers of spring carolled; gone all the beauty of Pergusa, now but a dirty little pond, where peasants steep their flax. But at least we can think of it still in Ovid\\u2019s words: \\u201cA spot at the bottom of a shady vale, watered by the plenteous spray of a stream that falls from wooded heights; where Nature decks herself in all her varied hues, where the ground is beauteous, carpeted with flowers of many tints.\\u201d \\u00c6tna appears again soon after the entrance to the valley of the Dittaino is passed, and beckons with such insistence that the train hesitates only a moment - at the station for Valguarnera Assoro - right before the railway restaurant. It is a tumbledown little shack with a big sign: Ristorante G. Galliano. If you are on good enough terms with the Signor Conductor, he may wait long enough for you to have a sip of the excellent country wine and a taste of the \\u201cbeautiful goat\\u201d the redoubtable Galliano purveys to such as can pay his very modest price. A few miles farther on is the station for Agira, which occupies the site of one of the very oldest Sikelian cities, lying back from the railroad, up in the hills. Later it was the birthplace of the historian Diodorus, who gives a picturesque account of his native village. Half an hour later the railway emerges from the hills upon the plain of Catania - so productive of grain that from the very beginnings of local history it has been known as the granary of Sicily - and leaving the main line at Bicocca, puts Catania and the great volcano behind, heading southward for Syracuse. Fine crops appear around the famous Lake Lentini, Sicily\\u2019s largest inland body of water, varying from about nine to twelve miles in circumference, according to the season. It is a dreary tarn, looking so like a big mud puddle or a meadow overflowed by stagnant salt water that it is easy to credit the tales of the mephitic vapors and exhalations and fevers which have made it the scourge of the neighborhood. Evidently the Sicilian railroads provide no drinking water for the employ\\u00e9s in wayside stations, for as we stopped the combination telegraph operator, baggage smasher, ticket agent and general utility man ran out to the locomotive and tapped the brass faucet in the tender for a drink. There is a big water-wheel a few miles farther on, arranged exactly like an Egyptian sakiyeh, and no doubt a survival of the Moorish wheel installed in that very well centuries ago. The apparatus is very simple. A horizontal wheel is geared loosely into a vertical one by big, clumsy wooden teeth. Over it projects an arm to which some patient draft animal is hitched. A long grass rope carrying an endless series of pottery jars or buckets completes the outfit by running over the vertical wheel, and all the water that does not splash back into the well flows into an irrigating pool and the ditches. The mule who worked this particular wheel acted as if he too were a Moorish survival, unaccustomed to modern inventions. Anyway, he tried to bolt when the engine shrieked. His plunging blindfold gallop sent the water flying in all directions, giving his peasant master a much-needed bath and earning the poor beast a beating, the blows of which could be distinctly heard as the train sped on. Around a curve Mt. \\u00c6tna appears again in all its majesty, filling up the entire background, looming more than twice as large as familiar Vesuvius. Its lower slopes are green and the upper reaches snow covered, split like a sore lip, with dark curves, queer bumps and sharp little corners of uplifted skin. Above them poises the soft black, slightly indented cone, canopied by a ridiculous tuft of cottony smoke no bigger than a handful at such a distance. Agnone is a hedge of yellow daisies, a deep pasture full of reddish brown kine, a farmhouse of stone with thatched shelters for the animals in the midst of rich cultivated lands. A mile away gleams the sea, a dull turquoise green flecked with windy ripples and dotted here and yon with white - \\u201cSilver sails come out of the west.\\u201d The tall timothy on both sides of the track, and other fields planted with oats and spiky cactus, seem mere picturesque settings for countless fiery poppies. Sheep by the hundred bolt in terror from the wild shrieks of the locomotive, preferring to run straight ahead on the track as long as they can possibly keep out of the way of the engine. Bold headlands here and there lower their stubborn crests for a few yards to give the flying train instantaneous vistas of wet sand gleaming far below, like blades of golden sickles edged with silver filigree. In rapid succession these rugged scenes slip behind, and we run along the shore past salt farms and their windmills; then a boldly jutting island, brave with forts and churches, rising out of the sea like Venice - Augusta the picturesque, modern survivor of Xiphonia, scene of many a fierce battle and bloody conquest. Augusta was founded in a most picturesque way by Emperor Frederick II. The town of Centuripe up in the hills, having roused the imperial ire by its sedition, was effectually razed. Then Frederick punished its people still further by driving them all into this spot and commanding them to stay there and be good. Perhaps its stormy birth in a measure accounts for Augusta\\u2019s stormy history. The most spectacular affair it ever witnessed was the tremendous naval duel between the fleets of France and Holland in 1676, when Admiral Duquesne defeated the Dutch Admiral De Ruyter, who afterward died of his wounds in nearby Syracuse. Following the coast closely, we flit swiftly past the Hybl\\u00e6an Hills, eager to stop for some of their historic honey, but relentlessly carried onward by the insensate iron horse, that knows not nor cares for the sweets that rival the product of Hymettus. All the way from Augusta the track borders the shore of the Bay of Megara, where anchored Nicias, Alcibiades and Lamachus, the Athenian generals who came to attack Syracuse in 415 B. C. with a fleet so vast that men paled merely to see it whiten the horizon. But to-day, instead of the tents and sails of invading hosts, you see evaporating-tanks and windmills, and snowy piles of salt dotting the rugged shore in serried ranks. Rushing across the neck of the promontory of Thapsus - now called Magnisi - we skirt Trogilus Bay, where the conquering fleet of Marcellus the Roman lay two centuries after the Athenian d\\u00e9b\\u00e2cle, cross the old Dionysian wall, sweep around the bold headland, and stop at Syracuse. Don\\u2019t be disappointed in Syracuse by what you see of the dirty little provincial town that yawns sleepily at you between the railroad station and your hotel. Suspend judgment until you reach the Greek Theater, and from the top row of seats carven into the eternal rock, look out over the gracious panorama below. Beyond the sparsely settled vineyards and groves covering what was once the Greater Syracuse, lies the city of to-day on Ortygia, an oyster-shell full-heaped with pearls, in a sapphire setting of twin harbors and glittering sands. The alchemy of golden sunshine transmutes whitewashed tenements into Greek palaces, fishing luggers into stately galleys of war, and prosaic modern peasants into the soldiers and citizens of a happier and more stirring day. And as you stand breathless with the wonder of it, history unfolds itself in memory, with something at every step to drive that history home, be it Sikel, Greek, Roman, Saracen or Norman. The ruins of the mighty fortress atop the inland hill breathe of the Age of Tyrants, and to follow the herculean walls of Dionysius around the deserted plateau fills one with awe and wonder anew, for the work seemingly has been performed by a race of giants. Below, yawning in the seacoast of Achradina, dim caverns invite the explorer\\u2019s rowboat. There are the Street of Tombs to search for relics - though most likely you will find only a few scattered bones; the Castello Maniaces on the tip of Ortygia, full of Byzantine memories; charming walks to and through the quarries, the famous Latomie; the astonishing catacombs and the Anapo trip. A score of other delightful excursions the visitor can take, providing he is not driven forward by the exigencies of a cut-and-dried itinerary, that wickedest and most specious of all excuses for not seeing enough of a country really to enjoy it! The mother colony was founded in 734 B. C. on the little island of Ortygia, named for the quail the Greeks found there in great coveys. From its very beginning the benignant gods smiled upon Syracuse, and it prospered so rapidly that within seventy years it was founding colonies of its own. Under the tyrant Gelon, son-in-law of the great and good Theron of Akragas, and later practically co-ruler with him of all Greek Sicily, the era of Hellenic supremacy began, with Syracuse in the van of progress. Indeed, Syracuse was of such paramount importance that sometimes its history is mistaken for the history of Sicily. Tyrants good and bad rose and fell; democracy overthrew tyranny, and tyranny overthrew democracy. Demagogues - the word means literally \\u201cpopular leaders\\u201d - rose to stir the people to action against the government or the tyrant - and sometimes threatened to become tyrants themselves. Seeing how easy it was to sway the rabble with hot words, men of every class began to practice public speaking; no young man\\u2019s education was complete without it; and oratory first became an art in Sicily. From the island of Ortygia the city spread up the hilly mainland in four new boroughs - Achradina, Tyche, Neapolis and Epipolai - making a mighty pentapolis; a community which was not only the foremost of all the Greek cities in the island, but much the greatest in physical extent of all the Greek cities in the world, and for a time the greatest city of Europe as well as of Greece. This naturally made Athens jealous, and in 415 B. C. the pent up force of Attic wrath loosed itself in a tremendous blast against Syracuse. But Athens\\u2019 traditional enemy, Sparta, sent the island city help, and the Athenian arms went down in one of the most appalling defeats of all history. After this vivid chapter, governments and tyrants rose and fell again as before, deliverers came and conquered in the name of the people, and passed, and at last the young giant Rome stepped in with brazen legionaries and put a period to the brilliant story. To-day, as in the beginning, the city is on Ortygia, the houses crowding together behind the old walls like birds on a roost, and you wonder why, when there was such ample space on the shore, the people huddled together so. The streets, moreover, are amazingly shifty. On foot you set out to explore the town and encircle it by keeping as close to the walls as possible - a matter of a mere hour and a half, with plenty of time to idle by the way. According to the maps this should be no great feat, but try as you may, it seems impossible to lay a true course, and becoming discouraged after slipping off one street four or five times, you abandon yourself to the vagaries of these astonishing high and byways - they fade into one another without sign or signal, they vanish on front doorsteps, end after half a block in blind alleys, terminate in bastions which lead one to suppose that the sea must be below on the other side, only to turn up somewhere else in most mysterious fashion, and not always running in the same direction as their beginning. There is little that is up-to-date about Syracuse. To a great extent it lives in medieval seclusion and its people are simple, genial folk so wholly out of touch with the world that whatever is essential for comfort or convenience is proper in public. On one street, for instance, I saw the economical wife of a small shopkeeper wash her baby\\u2019s only frock - a slim little red calico - and button it to dry over the bulgy part of a lamppost, which looked choked and uneasy as the tiny slip fluttered in the wind. Meantime the piccola signorita disported herself amiably in the street - and all her frolicking in the dust could not hurt what she wore. Near the center of the city stands the Cathedral, a queer combination of battlemented Moorish castle, ancient Greek temple and modern Christian structure. Nearly thirteen centuries ago Bishop Zosimus of Syracuse began the work of turning the ruined temple - built early in the sixth century B. C. - into a Christian church, filling in the peristyle with a solid wall in which some of the Doric columns are still visible. The Saracen invaders turned it into a mosque in the year 878, and for two centuries muezzins chanted the names of Allah and Muhammad from its walls. With the Norman conquest in the eleventh century the building again became a Christian house of worship, and though the earthquake of 1693 destroyed a part of it, the damage was soon repaired and it has ever since remained the diocesan church of Syracuse. Like many of the often restored cathedrals of Meridional Italy, its interior is barren and uninteresting, but its exterior, with Greek entablature and columns, Saracenic frieze and battlements, and hideous Renaissance fa\\u00e7ade and portico is unique among Christian churches. There seems some doubt among the arch\\u00e6ologists as to the deity worshiped here in pagan days. It was formerly ascribed to Diana, but the authorities now generally believe it was the shrine of Minerva, though Cicero\\u2019s glowing description of the Temple of Minerva (Athena) places that structure in a location apparently different from the site of the present Duomo. The orator says he saw a temple on whose apex was \\u201c...a great brazen shield overlaid with gold, which served as a landmark to sailors on entering the port. The folding doors of ivory and gold were also adorned with a marvelous golden head of Medusa.\\u201d Most of these magnificent treasures were stolen. The Roman pr\\u00e6tor Gaius Verres, a gentleman with a highly cultivated taste in works of art, stripped Syracuse - and all Sicily, in fact - absolutely bare of everything the Roman armies had overlooked. And when at last he was brought to book for his crimes, he fled into voluntary exile with his plunder rather than face the scathing invective of Cicero. The arch\\u00e6ologists\\u2019 dubiety regarding the name of the temple has no room in the minds of the street arabs, however, who vociferously proclaim it the \\u201cTempio di Diana,\\u201d and will not suffer you to leave until you have paid for this volunteered information. Diagonally across the Piazza Duomo is the externally unimposing Museum. Its collection, however, is both interesting and intelligently arranged. It covers the civilization of Sicily from the bone and flint implements of the extinct prehistoric Sikels, through the transitional Greek period of the metopes from Selinus, to the splendid coins and vases of the city\\u2019s supremacy as an Hellenic center of culture and art. In fact, the profile of Arethusa, on coins signed by Evanetus and Kimon, is considered the most exquisite Greek head known to us. In those days coin-makers were artists of the foremost rank, accustomed to signing their work, like painters and sculptors, and these two, Evanetus and Kimon, have left us a noble set of coins in which the Greek conception of divinity appears at its best. The most beautiful marble is a Venus Anadyomene, discovered in 1804, and preserved almost intact save for the head and one arm. Not very far away there are ruins of another and very remarkable Greek temple, formerly called for Diana, but now generally considered to have been dedicated to Apollo - the arch\\u00e6ologists seem to have a grudge against the virgin huntress! There is not much else that is Greek, but as you wander through the narrow streets, scattered bits of medi\\u00e6val architecture appear in the most unexpected places, like the splendid Sicilian-Gothic and Saracenic windows of the Montalto and Lanza palaces, all the richer and more wonderful because of the surroundings from which they look down upon the squalid streets and out-at-heel people. The later Palazzo Municipale, or City Hall, is a fine example of the architectural spirit of the seventeenth century, its type that of a private palace, a baronial mansion rather than a public building. During this period great attention was paid to ornamental ironwork for decorative purposes upon the fa\\u00e7ades of buildings; and all about us are delicate and satisfying window balconies, some of which plainly testify to their Spanish origin. The first of the Greek settlers brought their home legends with them to Sicily, where they found a friendly soil, attaining their fullest perfection in the sympathetic hands of the Latin poets. Some of the most beautiful weave through the story of Syracuse, and the most delightful walk in the city - one you will want to take often - leads you straight along the edge of the Great Harbor, on a wide, tamarind-bordered esplanade, with the town wall rising behind, to the picturesque, papyrus-fringed little pool accounted for by one especially gracious tale, and called the Fountain of Arethusa. Long centuries ago - so runs this immemorial fable - there bubbled up out of the beach of the Great Harbor a crystal spring. And close by, in the briny waters themselves, another little fount gushed forth, pure and sweet. The airy Greek fancy could not pass by so remarkable a coincidence, and the Syracusans quickly came to believe that the twin springs were the gentle nymph Arethusa, the well-beloved of Artemis (Diana), and her river-god lover Alpheus; that Arethusa, too impetuously wooed by Alpheus on the island of Ortygia in Old Greece, had been graciously changed by Artemis into a spring, and taking the long, dark journey under the Ionian Sea, had escaped to the sunlight again in the newer Ortygia in Sicily; that Alpheus, not faint-hearted, had changed himself to her own watery shape, and following hard and fast, had missed her by the merest trifle only, bubbling up in a second spring in the waters of the harbor close beside his beloved. But Poseidon of the sea was mightier than nymph or river-god. Shaking his mighty bed one day, he burst open the wall about fair Arethusa. - To-day her water is salt, not sweet, and no more does her lover Alpheus bubble up beside her in the Bay. \\n\\n\\nIX THE HARBOR AND THE ANAPO \\nAnother of the beautiful legends with which the history of Syracuse is deeply interwoven is the story of Kyana - Cyane - and Aidoneus or Pluto. To run it to earth take a stout green and blue rowboat across the Porto Grande, about two kilometers wide, to the river Anapo. The snapping breeze blows briskly, and the boat tumbles about in lively fashion upon the sparkling sapphire, past the big motionless yachts at anchor and the slow-curtseying sailing craft coming into the docks from the saline or saltworks in the marsh below the river. What a contrast between the harbor of to-day and that of twenty-three or four centuries ago, when not another city in the world could boast so great a port, so populous a harbor! Here swam the merchant fleets of all Sicily, of Greece, of Ph\\u0153nicia, the navy of haughty Syracuse, the innumerable small boats that darted about between ship and shore - and remember, too, that these were sailing craft, - every one sea spiders with oars for legs in windless weather. Around the curving line of the shore for three miles the ships docked, from island tip to rivermouth. Fringing the bay were sloping beaches where they careened and calked and tarred their galleys with slave labor. Shipyards, arsenals, and merchants\\u2019 warehouses lined its shores. All the activities of a great maritime people hummed about this bay with its margin of city. And all the city\\u2019s splendor, all her power, sprang from the harbor, and from her control of the waters, exactly as England, two thousand years later, began to rise to her present eminence by virtue of her position and her skill in deep waters. Only a little imagination is required to picture the salt-boats of the twentieth century as the short, clumsy triremes which on that memorable September 1, 413 B. C., brought about the dramatic climax of the war between Athens and Syracuse. The Athenians\\u2019 fleet bottled up in the Great Harbor by a line of chained-together galleys and merchant hulks anchored from the tip of Ortygia to the promontory of Plemmyrion a mile south, prepared to force its way out. All Syracuse and both armies lined the shores, stood up on the seats of the distant Theater, crowded the housetops to encourage the fighters with their cheering and shouts. The rival commanders made their usual orations, exhorting the crews to acquit themselves as men and patriots. Out into the Bay rowed the fleets - Grote tells the story vividly: \\u201cInside this narrow basin, rather more than five English miles in circuit, one hundred and eighty-six ships of war, each manned by more than two hundred men, were about to join battle - in the presence of countless masses around, near enough both to see and to hear; the most picturesque battle probably in history, without smoke or other impediments to vision, and in the clear atmosphere of Sicily.\\u201d At the first onset the impetuous Athenian attack, headed for the barrier, broke through the Syracusan defense, and the Athenians were shouting with triumph as they began to cut the hawsers fastening together the blockading hulks, when the Syracusan triremes closed in on them from all sides, and the action at once became general and desperate. Ship crashed against ship, and vessels once lashed together rarely separated. Though Syracuse could throw only seventy-six triremes of the line against the hundred and ten heavy Athenians, she reinforced her vessels with a perfect cloud of mosquito craft that hovered, stinging and galling, about the equal antagonists. In a measure the action demonstrated the efficiency and value of the small, swift cruiser or torpedoboat of later times, to which the light craft may be considered analogous, never daring to do more than shoot and run, and shoot and run again. Thucydides makes the peaceful harbor ring and echo again with the surging of the dramatic chorus of citizens and armies urging on the fight: \\u201cAnd the great noises of many triremes fallen foul of one another both amazed the seamen and prevented them from hearing what their leaders directed; for they directed thick and loud on both sides, not only as naval art required, but also from sheer eagerness, the Athenians crying out to their fleet to force the passage ... and the Syracusans to theirs how honorable a thing it would be to hinder their escape, and by this victory to improve every man the honor of his country.... While the conflict raged on the water, the land forces had a struggle and sided with them in their affections.... For the fight being near, and not all of them looking upon one and the same part, he that saw his own side prevail took heart and fell to calling upon the gods that they deprive them not of safety; and they that saw their friends have the worse, not only lamented but shrieked outright.... And one might hear in one and the same army, as long as the fight upon the water was doubtful, at one and the same time, lamentations, shouts that they won, that they lost, and whatever else a people in great danger is forced differently to utter.\\u201d Every one of the Athenian fleet and twenty-six Syracusans had gone ashore or foundered, only fifty vessels being left afloat, when the fight ended. Vainly did the Athenian generals plead with their men to fight again next day with those ships which could be hauled off the beach and made seaworthy; but so terrific had been the chaos, so utterly broken was the spirit of the Attic fleet, that the men refused to go aboard again, and the retreat was soon begun. Forty thousand men, \\u201clike the emigrant population of a city, wandered laden with their baggage away from the coast into a country hostile to them, without any definite goal for the journey, without sufficient supplies of food, without confidence in their ultimate preservation, tortured by fear, lost in speechless or stolid despair, or raging in savage fury against men and gods; ... but most terrible of all was it to leave on the desolate shore the many wounded and sick, who raised their voices in loud lamentation as their relatives and tent-fellows departed, History of Greece, iii, 402; Dr. Ernst Curtius. For days they struggled on, followed, harassed and headed off by the victorious Syracusans and their Laced\\u00e6monian allies, at last surrendering from sheer mental and physical exhaustion, though they knew full well the inevitable result - slavery for every soldier, an ignominious death for every general, the ruin of their country as a world power of the first rank. Something of all this runs through one\\u2019s mind as the rowboat approaches the low, glistening line of shore, with the wide, clean mouth of the Anapo in its center. For some distance before we actually enter the river, its pale green current cuts a furrow sharply through the heavier salt brine of the Bay. And it is fresh, not salt, long after it leaves the protection of its native banks. Into its brawling current pull the boatmen, expatiating volubly, not upon the scenery as one would naturally expect, but upon the virtues of their particular craft and the value of their time! No doubt these boatmen are fair types of the rugged island sailors who so nobly acquitted themselves twenty-three hundred years ago on the sparkling bay. Their deep, expressive eyes, and finely chiseled faces, full of Greek lines, amply confirm the historians\\u2019 story of their descent. Indeed, a majority of the Syracusans are of the classic Greek type, with little or nothing about them to suggest the later influence of alien races. Perhaps an hundred yards inside the mouth of the stream, beside a bridge, always stands a bevy of laundresses, stout-hearted, thick-thighed women with massive shoulders and muscular waists, their skirts carefully tucked up above their knees. Around their bare legs the icy water swirls in smart ripples, yet they toil there for hours together, seeming not to mind the cold in the slightest, though a few old crones on the bank testify mutely in their deformed hands and rheumatic feet to the power of the river gods who thus repay the profanation of their pellucid stream. Piled in baskets upon the shore and lying in bluish wet lumps upon black rocks are the clothes; and the linen is stout indeed that resists the battering those furious workers give it - a heavy club, a powerful right arm, a rough bare stone in running water which contains not a little sand and never a trace of soap. Indeed, the more pieces one\\u2019s linen comes home in, the more certain he may be that he has a good laundress! From the time a boat comes within hail until it disappears under the bridge beyond there is little washing done, the amiable amphibians evidently preferring to watch than to wash. Indeed, the only way to get a picture of them in action, is to threaten to pass by without paying toll unless they work. And then what washing it is! Not far beyond the laundresses is the open plain on the left of the stream, where two mutilated pillars, some ten minutes\\u2019 or so walk back from the bank, are all that is left of the temple of Zeus Olympus. The temple was built about the beginning of the sixth century, and King Gelon covered the statue of Zeus in it with a robe of pure gold which he made of the precious metal taken from the defeated Carthaginians at Himera; but about a century later Dionysius I took away the robe to convert it to his own purposes, telling the people, with grim humor, that it was \\u201ctoo cold in winter and too heavy for summer.\\u201d In the Cyane brook the men work slowly along, poling, pulling by the grasses, halting in little nooks in the banks to let down-coming boats slip by, rowing when they can. The limpid stream twists hither and yon through soft tinted fields alive with brilliant flowers. Here and there weeping willows, splendid old hairy trees, lean over the water and trail their long green tresses upon its quivering mirror. Exquisite papyrus plants, sylphlike shoots, top-heavy with the weight of their huge feather-dustery plumes, in places line both banks thickly for yards, or stand isolated in stately clumps ten, fifteen, eighteen feet high. Their presence is accounted for by two distinct traditions - one that they were brought in the ninth century by the invading Arabs. This is probably true, but there is no poetry about it. The other and prettier story tells of a gracious Pharaoh a thousand years earlier who, charmed by the reports of King Hieron\\u2019s lovely and gentle queen, Philistis, sent her as his choicest gift the loveliest thing dark Egypt could produce. Whichever story suits your fancy best - believe it! Whether they have lived in Sicily for ten centuries or twenty, the reeds still spring in slender, graceful stalks of tender green, without leaf or gnarl, from the moist earth, nodding their powder-puff heads lazily over the sparkling water and dreaming - if plants ever dream - of their sun-steeped home of eld beside placid Father Nile. Nowhere else in the world to-day does this paper-reed of the ancient Pharaohs grow wild; and here it strikes a strange exotic note among the harmonies of European flower and field. Clear as crystal and blue as the heavens is the circular pool from which the brook springs. Through its cold, pellucid azure splendid gray mullet and other fish - guardians of the sacred spring, perchance - dart or idle about among mimosa-like aquatic plants plainly visible twenty or thirty feet below. It is poetic water, full of shifting lights and nuances of color - now a silvery, glancing mirror, now soft gray and translucent, now pure azure and thin as rain-washed air; but always beautiful, always dimpling to the sun. And what more poetic than its story? When Pluto - again to give the Greek legend in the Latinized form preferred by the present day Sicilians - carried off Proserpina from the shores of Lake Pergusa, one of her attendant nymphs, Cyane, followed weeping after the black chariot until, in this mead of Syracuse, the King of Darkness turned, passed his scepter before her face, and the poor nymph dissolved into a pool of tears, the Pool of Cyane. But so potent was her grief that her tears, through all the centuries since, have continued to flow; and they still bubble up, a living spring beneath the limpid waters of the little blue mere, \\u201cTo witness if I lie.\\u201d Going back down-stream, the boatmen give an astonishing exhibition of how to \\u201cprotect\\u201d Government property. So jealously does the Italian Government guard its precious papyrus plants that each boat must stop at a station where customs guards keep watch to see that no visitor carries away more than one single stalk. The boatmen know this perfectly, yet when a fine clump of the reeds provokes the passengers to ecstasy they amiably stop and cut as many as they have passengers - and some for good measure - without a word about the regulations. When nearing the guard-float, however, they throw all the extra stalks overboard, explaining the rules to the bewilderment of the incensed or amused travelers. The absurdity of \\u201cprotecting\\u201d the papyrus from destruction by throwing it away strikes an American sense of humor very hard. Perhaps a little stiff fining of the boatmen for cutting too many pieces would have a more salutary effect! But the \\u201cheight of the ridiculous\\u201d is reached by the guards themselves. Looking us gravely over, they inquired if La Signora and I were sposati. I admitted it, and they shook their heads. \\u201cThrow away your stalk,\\u201d they said together to me. \\u201cA married couple is only one!\\u201d \\n\\n\\nX SYRACUSE, THE PENTAPOLIS \\nNever make the blunder of trying to study the Greater City when any of the big \\u201ctourist yachts\\u201d are in port. You will know soon enough when they are - cloop! cloop! cloop! go the hoofs under your windows long before you have thought of breakfast. An endless string of carriages plods out of the island full of gesticulating, noisy, Baedekering enthusiasts who make up in cheery adjectives what they lack in knowledge. When they are back at evening, white with dust and happily weary, and the launches have taken them all on board the white floating palaces, Syracuse sighs and sleeps again. Once more it is safe to venture out. Once more cabs can be had at decent rates. And once more the timid ghosts of Greek and Roman days come to the gentle call. Ortygia, the island, was once connected with the mainland by a mole of cut stone, and afterward separated and attached and separated again as the whims and dangers of the different periods dictated. Now it is both connected and detached. Between island and shore is the citadel, separated from both by little canals crossed by stout bridges, and capable of defense in time of necessity. All the dust of a whole rainless season seems to concentrate upon the dusty road leading from the island across the bridges, by the citadel, past the rows of shipping that fill the docks on either side of the mole, and so on through the deserted square which was once the Agora of Syracuse. Every Greek city had its agora, or marketplace, as every Roman city had its forum. Besides being the market, where food and commodities of every other sort were sold the agora was the assembling place of the city, the central exchange for news and views. You must use your imagination to-day to reconstruct the agora, to people it again with the dark faces and flowing robes of the Greeks of old, to hear the clank of weapons and armor as a Tyrant\\u2019s bodyguard passes through the unsmiling crowd: for the agora, now, is only a bare, open square, through the middle of which a naked red column thrusts upward. A kindlier fate has overtaken the Roman Pal\\u00e6stra near by - a gymnasium and auditorium where the youth of Latinized Syracuse used to polish their muscles and wits alike. One exquisite bit of it remains - the little semi-circular lecture hall, in which clear water covers the pit, and mirrors back the delicate maidenhair peeping from the cracks and joints between the marble seats in its gleaming horseshoe. What schoolboy debating societies met here, and who were the \\u201cexchange professors\\u201d who held forth in this choice hall where now waterbugs and tiny lizards alone give sign of life? Not far from town the road runs into pleasant farming country, followed by orchards of almonds, lemons, and citrons. Farther up the slopes of Neapolis and Epipolai straggle great rocky groves of uncanny, fantastically shaped old olives, the most disreputable-looking tenants of the soil imaginable. They are whorled like an oak, knobbed like an apple tree, split full of holes, leaning at all angles; and, most curious of all, some appear to be nothing but half-shells of bark, only half of each half-shell having any visible contact with the roots. How they live and bear fruit at all in such astonishingly rocky fields is a mystery, yet they are proverbially prolific. They seem ghosts of dead Syracuse, phantoms of the citizens who once, in the pride of their strength and glory, trod the streets of the great pentapolis of Epipolai, Neapolis, Tyche, Achradina and Ortygia - Syracuse all. Fewer than thirty-two thousand inhabitants exist now in the city, where more than half a million once looked down upon the great argosies afloat in their twin harbors. And the hills where Gelon and the Hierons, Agathocles and Timoleon flourished, where Theocritus and Archimedes were born and toiled, lie apart, dotted with scattered limestone ruins where hawk and bat, tourist and guide are the only living things to disturb this city of silence. About the Outer City, as the four mainland boroughs were called, Dionysius I - a brilliant soldier who by treachery and intrigue succeeded in raising himself to the tyranny early in the fifth century - spent seventeen years in constructing an enormous wall. Sixty thousand workmen with six thousand yoke of oxen constructed nearly three and a half miles in twenty days, a task whose herculean labor cannot be appreciated until the enormous blocks and the difficult formation of the country have been studied. Of the sixteen miles originally built, rather more than ten are still standing to testify to the solidity of the tyrant\\u2019s work. On the westernmost point of Epipolai, the highest part of the city, Dionysius built his great fort of Euryelus, now completely ruined. Words cannot make clear the fort\\u2019s size and strength. It is only at Syracuse, standing among the crumbling piles, that one can grasp the value and vastness of Dionysius\\u2019s greatest work. Its five massive towers and deep moats, carved out of the living rock, make it hard to understand how it was ever captured. Nevertheless, two hundred years later the Romans under Marcellus did it, though not so much by storm as by treason. This siege was the work of an army, the brilliant defense of the city the triumph of a single engineer - brave old Archimedes, who worked such marvels that not a man could be seen upon the walls. Away back in the good old King Hieron\\u2019s time, he had pierced them for both near and distant shooting, and brought to perfection every imaginable weapon and military engine. Plutarch says he had huge claws with which he picked up galleys bodily and smashed them like eggs against the walls; ballistas and catapults and crossbows for heavy and light artillery; hooks like cranes\\u2019 bills; and certain devices for picking up ships and whirling them around in the air like huge pinwheels till their crews were all spilled out or dead. So greatly did the Romans come to dread his uncanny machines that they finally refused to approach those silent, apparently unoccupied walls at all, and the city had to be taken some other way than by storm. At last, after a year\\u2019s siege, on the night of the Feast of Artemis, a party of Romans scaled the northern walls without resistance from the drunken guards, opened the gate, and the whole army marched in upon Epipolai. With the day, Marcellus stood there upon the heights and looked down over the fair city he had come so far to win. Stern man and able soldier though he was, this Roman had the soul of a poet, and as he looked, and mused upon all Syracuse had gone through before, all she would probably endure before he gained the inner city, he wept. However, he did not have to fight his way - Ortygia was betrayed by a Spanish mercenary officer. The most tragic of the events that followed was the death of the greatest genius ever given to immortality by Sicily. The accounts differ in details. But it seems certain that Marcellus sent a soldier to summon Archimedes. The legionary found the aged scholar at work upon a mathematical problem, and when he asked for time to finish his demonstration, the blunderer misunderstood and killed him. Whether this be the exact truth or not, we know that Marcellus sincerely mourned his dead adversary. In spite of the Roman commander\\u2019s tears over the sufferings of Syracuse, when first he saw it, he did not scruple to take away all he could of its pictures and statues and other works of art to adorn his triumphal procession at home, while the public funds he seized for Rome. This plundering of unfortunate Syracuse did not by any means stop with Marcellus, but went on through centuries, the worst offender being Verres of infamous fame. From the shattered walls of Fort Euryelus spreads a magnificent view, bounded only by the mists in the distance. North and south run the scalloped shores, fading into the dancing blue of the Mediterranean; south and eastward lies Ortygia, the sun sparkling upon its thousand facets of white walls and tiled roofs, while in the opposite direction, when the clouds lift, stands majestic \\u00c6tna, still wearing his winter nightcap of snow. Straight west tower the hills, peak on peak, and the littoral blossoms with every scented fruit of the field. Not far from the Fort is a little cottage marked Caff\\u00e8, where the improvident, or those who have perfect digestions, may buy luncheon. But for the average person it is a good deal better to take along the sightseer\\u2019s snack the hotel puts up without extra cost - if you are living en pension - and eat it on the back porch. The Caff\\u00e8 serves \\u201ctea,\\u201d if you foolishly ask for it; but ink made from dried willow leaves is even less refreshing than the thin red country wine. Tea making is a fine art Sicily has yet to learn. However, the view from the rear veranda down the steep slope to the Bay of Trogilus more than compensates for the trivial discomforts of poor tea and iron chairs. Evidently the host is determined that his furniture shall not be numbered among the spoils of Sicily by the souvenir-hunting visitor. How those ancient Greeks did build for futurity! Deep down under the rocky plateau, at the cost of no one knows how many lives or what money, they carved two enormous aqueducts that gave old Syracuse to drink from distant mountain streams. No dynamite helped them tear out the adamantine channel; no greasy rock-drills worked by steam chattered and thumped down there in the dark where now one hears without seeing it, the water which still gurgles contentedly on its way to the sea. It is all hand work, and one is filled with admiration akin to awe as the eye follows the low, square limestone copings that mark the course of one of them across hill and vale and field, over the heights of the Epipolai down toward the harbor. Though Rome has left us comparatively few monuments in Sicily, they show clearly the difference between Greek and Roman ideals, in life as well as in art. The Greeks reared matchless temples and theaters never equaled for their purity and simplicity; the Romans, baths and amphitheaters whose floridness suggested display and luxury. The amphitheater of Syracuse is like all Roman amphitheaters, a vast elliptical arena - it measures two hundred and thirty-one feet long by one hundred and thirty-two wide - with an enormous cistern in the middle, to provide for flooding the ellipse for naval spectacles. The arena wall forms the side of a vaulted corridor with eight gates to give entrance and exit for fighters and beasts. Above all rise the seats in tiers, and in the arena you can pick out, upon shattered blocks of marble, several names of patricians who were \\u201cbox-holders\\u201d in the grand tier. Its very size bears witness to the degradation of Syracuse under the Roman rule, when the citizens, no longer satisfied with \\u201cstage deaths\\u201d in the theater, or with the splendid comedies of Aristophanes, demanded actual death and real blood here in the larger arena, where to-day the peaceful grasses and wild flowers innumerable spread their cloth of green and gold and crimson in a winding sheet of eternal beauty about the sanguinary old ruin. Here we met a young countryman of ours who promptly announced that he was abroad studying languages, and that, since paterfamilias \\u201chad a pull,\\u201d he was going to be a consul-general as soon as he finished his linguistic labors and decided to which country he wished to go. A short distance beyond the amphitheater is the biggest altar in the world - six hundred and six feet long, seventy-five feet wide, and six feet high. King Hieron built it so that Syracuse might be able to celebrate its Independence Day properly - its Fourth of July, if you choose. When the last usurper had been gotten rid of, in what the historians call the First Age of Tyrants, the festival of the Eleutheria was instituted in honor of Zeus Eleutherios, the god of liberty; and it is rather remarkable that Syracuse kept right on celebrating after the democracy had ceased and the meaning of the festival had vanished. On Hieron\\u2019s altar was made a sacrifice every year as big as the altar itself. Think of butchering and partly burning up four hundred and fifty oxen at once to make a holiday! But then, in those old days they were open-handed devotees of their gods, and the whole city had a glorious spree on such a gala occasion as the Eleutherian Feasts. Across the road is the Latomia del Paradiso, one of the vast quarries from which the stone that built Syracuse was hewn. Carved out of the solid rock to a depth of perhaps an hundred and twenty-five feet, the dripping, barren stonepit has mellowed with time; and Sicilian Nature, with her usual prodigality, has transformed it into a riot of warm wild color. Tradition makes Dionysius a suspicious monarch who constructed cavern-prisons to find out what was going on among his political prisoners. In the western wall of the Latomia is an S-shaped grotto which has been capriciously chosen as one of these strange houses of detention, and called the Ear of Dionysius. Whether it was really part of the tyrant\\u2019s original plan or an accident in the quarrying, the fact remains that a person at the upper end can hear even whispers from below. Alongside the Paradiso is another quarry, the Latomia di Santa Vener\\u00e0, a cultivated garden filled with even more profuse and brilliantly colored vegetation than its beautiful neighbor. All through the quarries are great columns, ledges, pinnacles and turrets, evidently harder portions of the rock left by the quarrymen when they were taking out the stone. Immediately to the west of the quarries is the Greek Theater, a vast open playhouse, the largest in existence after those at Miletus and Megalopolis. Though the superstructure of fifteen tiers of seats and the stage have vanished, the auditorium is in very fair condition despite its age, about twenty-four hundred years. In the greatest days of Greece relatively little care was bestowed upon the design and decoration of private dwellings, and not a sign remains of most of them. But the theaters, the social centers of Greek-Sicilian life, remain; in part because they were hewn out of the everlasting rock of the hills, and partly because the Romans kept them in use and repair. Here in the Syracusan Theater it was that the illustrious Pindar, laureate of princes, sang his most fulsome odes to the glory of that cruel and suspicious tyrant, the first Hieron, who is supposed to have founded it. We wonder at the poet\\u2019s mood. Was it simply a question of so much flattery for so much patronage, or what - ? Two hundred years later the second Hieron, the good king, restored and embellished the theater; and upon fragments of the marble plating which covered the royal seats, we find his name with the names of his wife, the Queen Philistis, and Nereis, his daughter-in-law. Philistis, with whom Hieron fell in love when he was only a rising young army officer, has left us her portrait upon striking coins. And certainly, if she was as sweet-faced and gentle as the artists have pictured her in precious metal, we cannot wonder that her royal lover-husband wished to perpetuate her beauty forever. Like the tyrant Hieron, the King was a patron of the arts, and in his day Theocritus invented and developed his pastoral odes and bucolics, which marked the period in an artistic sense as clearly as Pindar\\u2019s poems marked the earlier r\\u00e9gime. The theater saw more than one drama not of the pure stage, for here eager multitudes watched the glorious combat in the Great Harbor, and here later the \\u201cpurest hero in the whole tale of Sicily\\u201d appeared before his adopted countrymen. Noble by birth and nobler by deed, Timoleon of Corinth, sent in 344 B. C. with an army in response to the plea of Syracuse for aid against tyrants at home and barbarians from abroad, re\\u00ebstablished the republic, sent for his wife and children, and retiring from public life, settled down to enjoy his later years near the people he had liberated. But though sudden blindness smote the grand old soldier-statesman, his faculties were unclouded to the last. Whenever Syracuse had need of the cunning of his brain, the citizens brought him in state, in a carriage, and led him to the stage of the theater, where out of the fullness of his experience he advised them for the welfare of Syracuse. Eight years only elapsed from his coming to his silent departure across the Styx; and \\u201cSo died and so was honored,\\u201d Freeman tells us, \\u201cthe man of the worthiest fame in the whole story of Sicily, the man who thought it enough to deliver others and who sought nothing for himself.\\u201d And Timoleon was not only great - he was fortunate! To deliver a whole people quickly and well, to be smitten with the black affliction of blindness while still in the very zenith of his popularity - and so to add the people\\u2019s pity and love to their admiration - and then soon to die a beloved hero before the fickle public mind could forget him and the fickle public tongue learn to slander and to curse his name, was the highest fortune man could wish - though in all probability Timoleon himself never realized how kind the gods were to him! From the upper level of the Theater the most desolate street of Syracuse climbs up the hill - the Street of Tombs, its burial vaults and niches yawning and yearning for the bodies they once sheltered. For centuries it has been the amiable custom, whenever the tomb of a great man is lost, to ascribe to him the finest mausoleum in the vicinity. We know positively that Timoleon was buried either in or very near the agora of Syracuse. We know also that when Cicero was the qu\\u00e6stor of Sicily he discovered the tomb of Archimedes outside the city, and identified it by the geometrical diagram carved upon it to illustrate the master\\u2019s favorite demonstration that the solid content of a sphere is equal to two-thirds that of its circumscribing cylinder. Both mausolea have disappeared, and two fine Roman-Doric tombs beside the road to Catania have been arbitrarily identified with Timoleon and Archimedes, regardless of the rights of their original occupants. Amusing incidents often transpire from the fact that the Sicilian is quite as eager to practice his halting English as we are to struggle with Italian. An ancient long-bearded monk in a very dirty robe opened the door of the church of San Giovanni Evangelista to us, and asked quickly: \\u201cTedesco?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cAh - Russky?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cHmph. Inglese?\\u201d \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cDiavolo! But you speak a little English, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d \\u201cA little,\\u201d I replied - in Italian. The monk stared at me in disgust. \\u201cIf you can, why don\\u2019t you? I speak it whenever I get the chance.\\u201d This exceedingly interesting church dates from the latter part of the twelfth century, and its rose-window is a splendid example of the glass-staining and composition of that time. According to a popular legend, the Apostle Paul preached in the crypt-like chapel when he was in town - \\u201cAnd landing in Syracuse, we tarried there three days\\u201d (Acts, XXVIII:12) - and the monk shows the altar where he \\u201ccelebrated the Mass.\\u201d Unfortunately for the illusion, the original San Giovanni was a fourth century structure, so St. Paul could not have seen it on his way to Rome or at any other time. The monk also points out a granite column at which he says St. Marcian was scourged to death, becoming the first martyr in Syracuse, and his seat and vaulted altar-tomb. St. Marcian\\u2019s column stands close to the entrance to the catacombs, which underlie much of the Achradina quarter, and are not only far larger than those at Rome, but are among the most imposing subterranean cemeteries in the world. The main gallery, ten feet wide and eight feet high, runs through the solid limestone for more than a hundred yards. People of distinction were usually buried in the rotundas, large circular chambers or chapels; and here, when the churches above ground were destroyed, or open services interdicted, the hunted faithful worshiped in secret. Here and there, now carved over a door, now rudely daubed in red upon the side of some grave-niche, is the likeness of a palm branch, dumb witness that here lay one who valued faith more than life, and died a martyr. Even in these dank and gloomy caverns brave souls made art of a crude sort possible. Upon the walls, in the lunettes and above the chapel altars are rough frescoes, poor things in color and design, but breathing the civilizing message of that Divine love which nothing can conquer. Walls and ceilings and doorways of this miniature city of perpetual night are sooty and black with the fumes of the lamps the Christians used. There is little doubt that large numbers of them took refuge in the catacombs during the early persecutions. We to-day cannot conceive of the horror of living in clammy darkness lighted only by the feeble, guttering flames of little bronze lamps. But we can admire the stern fortitude of men and women who could endure all things, and gladly weave into the handles of those poor lamps the words \\u201cDeo gratias - Thanks to God!\\u201d Unfortunately, not a tomb has been left undisturbed, and the only relics now visible are an occasional small pile of bones and smashed pottery; the few sarcophagi which were found having been removed to the Museum where, out of place, they possess little or no significance. In the same vicinity is the Latomia dei Cappuccini, the largest and by far the most impressive of the quarries, a huge, irregularly shaped gulf whose sides are precipices, honeycombed with small pits, all carved out of honey, or, it might be, from dull clouded amber, and whose uneven floor here and there springs into the air in enormous fantastic columns of golden-gray stone. Both walls and columns riot in luxuriant verdure and flowers - silver vermouth, yellow spurge, glorious crimson roses against green cataracts of glossy ivy and myrtle, honeysuckle and clematis. In the heart of this vast floral labyrinth lofty pines reach vainly upward toward the world from still depths where no breeze ever scatters the leaves, no gales lash denuded branches; and sun-warmed and dew-bathed, little groves of silvery-gray olives flourish beside prickly pear, sulphur colored lemons, yellow nespoli, golden oranges, almond blossoms all a mass of pallor or blushes in the tender warmth of early Spring. Throughout this smiling beauty, shadows dapple rock and foliage, like somber memories of the tragic Greek days, when the captured Athenians were thrust into the inhospitable quarry, then no such glowing garden as it is to-day. \\u201cAt first the sun by day was both scorching and suffocating,\\u201d says Thucydides, \\u201cfor they had no roof over their heads, while the Autumn nights were cold, and the extremes of temperature engendered violent disorders.... The corpses of those who died from their wounds, from exposure to the weather, and the like, lay heaped one upon another. The stench was intolerable, and they were at the same time afflicted by hunger and thirst.... Every kind of misery which could befall men in such a place befell them. This was the condition of the captives for about ten weeks.... The whole number of the prisoners is not accurately known, but they were not less than seven thousand.\\u201d At the end of the ten weeks many of them were sold. Thucydides does not explain the fate of those not disposed of in the great auction, but Grote says: \\u201cThe dramas of Euripides were so peculiarly popular throughout all Sicily, that those Athenian prisoners who knew by heart considerable portions of them, won the affections of their masters. Some even of the stragglers from the army are affirmed to have procured for themselves, by the same attraction, shelter and hospitality during their History of Greece. Others beside the Athenians have found their last beds here. In a gloomy little side cave, cut in the wall a foot or two above the floor, is a niche sealed with a marble slab -  Sacred to the memory of Richard Reynall, Esq., British Vice Consul To Syracuse He departed this life Sept. 16 A. D. 1838. He was killed in a duel by an expert with weapons he did not know. What a vista that opens up! Who was the braggart who forced the quarrel, what were the weapons, what the circumstances of the quarrel, the conditions under which the courageous Englishman went consciously to his fate? And how sad the legend inscribed to our own young countryman upon a lonely niche in the soft tufa a little farther along -  \\u201cWilliam Nicholson, Midshipman in the Navy of the United States of America, who was cut off from Society in the bloom of life and health on the 18th day of September, 104, A. D., et anno \\u00e6tatis 18.\\u201d Just above this latomia, among the olive groves and flowers, surrounded by fine gardens, is a charmingly situated hotel, whence one can look down into this sunken stone quarry-garden if he chooses, and dream of swart laborers hewing out the stones that reared Syracuse a city of cities, of the physical agonies and homesickness of the grave Athenian slaves, or simply of the graciousness of Demeter in clothing the ragged stones as not Solomon in all his glory was arrayed. But for me the hotel by the Bay, the outlook over sparkling, living water, the music of it ever in my ears. And to think of Syracuse is to think of the Promenade of Arethusa, with its musical speech, its Greek faces all about, its maidens and their lovers who need but the touch of sympathetic imagination to be transformed into the nymphs and fauns of Greek days! \\n\\n\\nXI CATANIA AND MOUNT \\u00c6TNA \\nCatania is the second city of the island in importance, and has a far reaching trade in oil and wine, sulphur and grain and almonds, and the other products of the rich and fertile plain at whose edge it stands guard. It is a city of humdrum, a town which, like Milan, reminds one strongly of some American manufacturing center with a large foreign population, and surely nothing could be further from presenting an historic visage at first sight. Yet its history is a picturesque and vivid tapestry of which the main threads have always been the heroic spirit and enterprise of its people. Settled in 729 B. C. - when the city by the Tiber was only a quarter of a century old - Kataneion or Katane in the sixth century became famous for a reformer and lawgiver named Charondas, some of whose enactments were decidedly original. Divorce he made simple.... Either husband or wife could put away the other for sufficient cause; but neither could remarry with anyone younger than the person divorced! And Charondas died by one of his own laws, which forbade men to come armed into the General Assembly. The story goes that he had been out in the hills hunting robbers: when he came back the Assembly was in an uproar, and he hurried in to quiet things. Instantly a member saw his sword, and cried: \\u201cCharondas, you break your own law!\\u201d \\u201cBy Zeus!\\u201d he replied, \\u201cI will not set aside my law - I will confirm it!\\u201d and he plunged the sword into his breast. Long afterward, in B. C., 476, the emulous Tyrant Hieron juggled with the city\\u2019s name and its people, depopulating it and then recolonizing it with new settlers and giving it another name. Are the sober Catanians who pass us to-day descended from the old citizens who came back into their own when the Tyrant died? Or are this trolley-car conductor, this gayly uniformed hall-porter, sons of the Hieronic colonists? And this very street on which we study the Catanians of to-day - was it the ancient way leading toward \\u00c6tna, for whom the city was renamed? The chief reason for Catania\\u2019s modern appearance is - it is modern! Destroyed so many times, now in part, again entirely, by \\u00c6tna, it is more or less new, a veritable ph\\u0153nix of Sicilian cities. Suspended from the ceiling of our room in the hotel was the very newest thing, a huge chandelier garnished with exceedingly new and shiny electric light fixtures. But alas! when we attempted to illuminate, we found the chandelier a hollow delusion. When the porter came, he smiled with the indulgence of superior knowledge. \\u201cThe chandelier is not intended for lighting. That would be extra - electricity is very expensive!\\u201d So we had to be content with the feeble gleam of one honest tallow dip in a room almost as big as a whole floor in a New York mansion. As to antiquities, Catania has its share - a Greek Theater, a Roman amphitheater, a forum, baths, a nymph\\u00e6um, and aqueduct, and so on. Most of them, thanks to \\u00c6tna\\u2019s past activity, are now subterranean and but partly excavated - indeed, almost forgotten. But Catania does better by her celebrities. Tisias of Himera, locally nicknamed Stesichorus because of his genius in perfecting the lyric chorus of the Greek drama presented in the Theater some fourteen hundred years ago, has had a large and handsome square named in his honor, as well as the street leading straight from the heart of the town toward the mountain. In the Piazza Stesicoro stands a monument to Catania\\u2019s favorite son, Bellini the composer, born here in 1802 and brought back in 1867 from Paris, where he died. A more effective monument is the Villa Bellini, the city\\u2019s handsome, hilly public park. Myriad steep paths of clean yellow and white pebbles carefully set on edge in mortar, picked out in black and white scrollwork, and edged with solid walls of variegated flowers, lead up to two fine knolls, on one of which is a trim little belvedere flanked by flowerbeds. On the other is a large bandstand. Between the two \\u00c6tna hangs motionless on the horizon, more like the mirrored reflection of a volcano than a real mountain, his feet clothed in the foliage of vineyard and forest, his head capped with snows that almost never melt, gleaming in the sunshine like a giant\\u2019s silvery hair. Another charming little park is the Flora della Marina, a narrow strip of garden and greensward along the Bay. As you come through an arch of the railway viaduct, it bursts upon you with the same effect that a strip of brilliant Persian embroidery would have upon a somber coat, and you exclaim with pleasure at the inviting lawns and starry beds of bright colored flowers. Here and there idles an immaculate and lynx-eyed customs guard in sailor\\u2019s uniform. From the ship\\u2019s mast in the center floats the gaudy Italian tricolor; and in the background is a sailors\\u2019 home from which tarry old shellbacks stump out to sit dreaming on the benches that give upon the Bay. King Roger\\u2019s eleventh century Cathedral has been so restored, because of the earthquakes that have wrecked it time after time, that it is simply a huge, composite modern structure. It contains the tombs of various members of the royal house of Arag\\u00f3n, who generally resided here while the powerful baronial families were really ruling in Palermo the capital. In 1445 King Alphonso the Generous founded the first Sicilian university here, and for a long time Catania was the literary center of the island. The handsome new university building, however, dates back only to 1818. Sicily has always been rather finicky about its saints, and Agatha of Catania, Lucy of Syracuse and Rosalie of Palermo are only three among many venerated virgin patronesses. Saint Agatha was executed by the Roman pr\\u00e6tor Quintianus, and has a chapel in the Cathedral containing relics and jewels and a gilded silver statue said to contain her head. In any event, the figure is highly revered, and every year, in February, is carried in procession from church to church throughout the city. Image and pedestal weigh several tons, and about three hundred men robed in white, sturdy fellows all, have to shoulder the fifty-foot beams to lift it. Even with so many bearers, the procession moves forward only a few feet at a time, and it takes two or three days to complete the ceremony. Holy day spells holiday to the Latin, and his religious ecstasy finds outlet in blazing fireworks, whoops of joyous enthusiasm, streets jammed to suffocation. Windows and housetops as well as the streets are packed with an eager, childish throng bubbling over with mercurial spirits. One of the queerest features of this celebration, which goes back to time immemorial, is a privilege allowed the usually demure and sedate women. A young Catanian told me with great relish that on festival nights the women veil heavily, completely hiding their faces with the exception of the left eye. With that they may work such havoc as they can. Even the bearers of the sacred image return the sly winks and coquettish glances of the flirts whose identity is so perfectly concealed. In the Piazza Duomo before the Cathedral, is a queer old lava elephant, mounted upon a florid pedestal, bearing upon his saddle an Egyptian obelisk. He looks down upon the noisy trolley cars circling about his feet with an amused expression, as if ridiculing such foolish modern means of conveyance. So old is he that no one knows when he was made, nor why, though legend says the artist was the necromancer Heliodorus - surely a man talented enough to fly through the air from Constantinople to Catania to escape his persecutors, was capable of executing even this weird beast! Amber of a most unusual quality is a feature of Catania. Nearly every store has some of it, in the rough, and made up into beautiful beads, brooches, smokers\\u2019 articles, combs and ornaments of various sorts, though it is not nearly so plentiful to-day as it was twenty years or so ago. The merchants shake their heads over the future of this now high priced commodity, for the best beds have been completely exhausted, and the divers have greater difficulty every year in finding enough. Deeper in color than the usual clear or clouded variety, this amber is a rich marmalade color, with hues ranging from black and dark brown in the cheaper grades through all the ochres and umbers to pure yellow of different tones. The choicest pieces look as if the clear amber had been dipped in oil or vaseline, giving it a distinct bluish tint, observable, the dealers claim, in no other amber in the world - the same tinge that is to be seen upon water when oil is spilled upon it; and the amount of blue, and its brilliancy, determine the value of the product. In some of the pieces are perfectly preserved mosquitoes, looking exactly like bottled specimens in the museums. \\u201cHow old are they?\\u201d I asked one dealer. The Catanian shrugged his despair of figures. \\u201cOh! They were old already when Homer sailed his ship in here on the way back to Troy. They must be five hundred years old at least, Signore!\\u201d After all, it is neither history, modern character, nor amber that makes Catania, but \\u00c6tna. The finest view of him to be had from the city is from the suppressed Benedictine monastery of San Niccol\\u00f2, or San Benedetto, on the western edge of the town. Its church, the largest in Sicily and interesting in itself, contains one of the finest pipe organs on the island, an immense instrument with five keyboards. When we asked how soon the next service would be held - I consulted my watch as I spoke - the custodian smiled. \\u201cGia! You will have a long time to wait for the next service. It is played once a year, Signore. No more. A very fine organist, the best in Italy, comes down from Naples and plays. He has just been here!\\u201d Since 1866 the monastery has been used as a barrack and school, museum and library. On the roof rises the large dome of the Observatory. Connected with it, and really of much greater practical importance, is an underground laboratory and experiment station full of seismographs and other instruments of the finest precision for the study and recording of earthquakes. To anyone interested in vulcanological phenomena, this deepset cavern and its curious apparatus make one of the most fascinating objects of interest in Sicily - yes, in the world. From the dome of the church of San Niccol\\u00f2 you see not only \\u00c6tna, but the whole horizon. On all sides stretch the reddish-brown tiles of the city, the flat evenness and monotony broken here and there as spire or dome thrusts up through the red crust. Off to one side a prosperous little street ends abruptly in a ragged edged wall of lava some thirty or forty feet high, testifying mutely to the terrific activity that has characterized \\u00c6tna at intervals for hundreds of years. A little farther along desolation begins, and nothing is visible in that direction but a long brown spoor leading up the giant\\u2019s side - a cold stone river to-day, rough and scaly as an armadillo\\u2019s back, but once a fiery serpent whose glowing jaws opened to engulf at least part of the metropolis. On either side beyond the confines of the rebuilt town are vineyards and silver-gray olive groves, vegetable gardens and glowing plantations, full of warmth and color and contrast, and above all the hard china blue of the hot Sicilian sky. Above everything towers the tremendous bulk of \\u00c6tna - Mongibello - standing superbly alone, lord of all this eastern section of Sicily, rising from the sea without foothills or approach. To-day the Titan sleeps, but in the eighty major awakenings recorded in historic times, he has wrought incalculable destruction. Lava has poured from those black lips in hissing floods, one of which covered forty square miles; earthquakes which have laid fifty cities in ruins at once have accompanied the fiery retchings of the monster; ashes and sulphur and stones by millions of tons have rained destruction upon the fertile countryside for miles around. Yet though he has wrought misery and death ruthlessly, \\u00c6tna is also a benefactor, for the soil he has made and fertilized bears crops of marvelous richness and abundance. Tradition from the beginning has made the crater the prison of a cyclops, whose struggles to free himself have caused the eruptions. Virgil sang of him; Empedocles; many another. Sicily to them was pre\\u00ebminently the home of the nether gods, and \\u00c6tna their most striking manifestation, a peak of mingled fire and snow. Indeed, it was not until Dante came that men were willing to believe anything less of \\u00c6tna than the supernatural. The area of Sicily is some ten thousand square miles, and this greatest of European volcanoes occupies almost one-twentieth of it. It is nearly 11,000 feet high - the ascent is practicable only in Summer - and covered with more than two hundred smaller volcanoes or cones, huge safety-valves for the big boiler, through which the continual ebullition of the slumbering hell within finds exit in steam and vapors. Having experienced the doubtful delights of climbing smaller Vesuvius - it is less than half \\u00c6tna\\u2019s height - we decided that \\u00c6tna was to be ours from a distance only, much as we regretted not to see the indescribably magnificent effect of sunrise from its peak. Many visitors are satisfied to make the shorter, easier trip up the Monti Rossi, \\u201cThe Brothers,\\u201d two of the minor craters thrown up in 1669 on the side of the main peak. They rise to the not inconsiderable height of three thousand feet themselves, and the views from them are very fine. It is possible, moreover, to encircle the mountain by railway, and so to enjoy very satisfactory vistas of both volcano and countryside - vast ragged plains of lava like petrified sponges of red and black and gray, the dark, fertile soil the lava makes, rich with vineyards and fruit plantations, small \\u201csafety-valve\\u201d craters, often hissing threats, and farm-houses among the trees in this, the most thickly populated agricultural district in creation. A brief stop over at one or more of the towns along the line affords still further opportunity to see the Titan and his works. All these towns are rich in history, and the most surprising and impossible echoes come ringing out of the past at the touch of a modern foot. For instance, Adern\\u00f2, a comfortable town with a big, dilapidated Norman castle in it, stands on the spot where Dionysius I founded his city of Hadranum twenty-three hundred years ago. Near it once stood the Sikel temple of Hadranos. Instead of human guardians, more than a thousand great dogs protected this shrine of the fire god, and their fame spread all over the world. Fragments of this structure are still to be found in a private garden near the town. The railroad - it is called Circumetn\\u00e9a - not only encircles the mountain, as its title indicates, but also climbs up along the slopes, reaching an altitude at one point 3,195 feet above the sea. This gives the traveler an opportunity to see two of the different zones or belts of vegetation on the volcano. Lowest of all is the cultivated zone, in which deciduous growths and the grapes of \\u00c6tna play a prominent part. Just above the tracks begins the second belt, known as the Regione Boscosa, or forest region, which reaches up nearly four thousand feet higher. This consists mainly of evergreen pines, of birches in its upper section, and of a few insignificant groves of oak. The third and topmost division, extending to the black lipped silent crater itself, is the sterile Deserta, where only the most stunted vegetation exists. In 1040 that Byzantine would-be deliverer of Sicily, Giorgios Maniakes, attacked the Saracens outside Maletto. The Norwegian Prince - afterward King - Harald Hardradr, and a considerable body of his berserkers formed part of the Byzantine army; and the allied forces scored a decisive victory. A century and a quarter later a monastery was founded there, and in 1799, during the Bourbon period, Ferdinand IV gave the whole estate to Lord Nelson, creating him Duke of Bronte, a nearby town whose name means thunder. The Villa, as it is now called, is still the property of an Englishman, the Viscount Bridport, who also retains his local title. The most picturesque of these \\u00c6tnean towns is Randazzo, an interesting place where the women throw voluminous white shawls over their heads when they go to mass. Although Randazzo is closer to the crater than any other town, it has always escaped destruction, and so is full of exceedingly interesting medieval remains - houses, a palace with an inscription in Latin so poor that a schoolboy might have written it, and a ducal castle now used as a prison. What an untoward fate for a noble structure from whose walls project the sharp iron spikes where the ancient Dukes impaled the heads of criminals they executed! During July and August \\u00c6tna may be ascended from Randazzo. The trip takes only about six hours, and the hotel proprietor will provide guides, mules and food for about seven dollars (American), for each climber. Another echo of ancient days is the little Byzantine church at Malvagna, the only one of its kind in the island, by the way, that survived the Saracen invasion and conquest. A delightful little excursion may be made from Catania by carriage and boat along the coast to the Scogli de\\u2019 Ciclopi. To the prosy geologists, who mess about with their little hammers, these tremendous boulders are no doubt merely evidences of titanic natural convulsions. But to the rest of mankind, with a love for blind old Homer, they are the stones poor clumsy Polyphemus hurled at escaping Ulysses and his intrepid companions. The stately hexameters of the Odyssey give the story a noble swing - the brawny Greek hero burning out the drunken giant\\u2019s eye with the blazing end of a pole; the escape in the chilly dawn clinging to the bellies of the cyclop\\u2019s sheep while he ran his huge hands over their backs; the launching of the little boat, and the daring mockery of the bewildered giant. Blind and raging, crossed for the second time in his blighted life by puny beings he could crush with one hand, Polyphemus tore off the top of a small hill and threw it, missing the Greeks by a hair, but raising such a wave that their boat was almost washed ashore. Again Ulysses cried out upon him, and again the giant threw. And to this day the rocks tower out of the sea, one of them over two hundred feet above water and a couple of thousand feet in girth. Out of this giant\\u2019s missile the Italian authorities have made them a geodetic survey and hydrographic station. What would Homer - or Ulysses! - think if he could see the rocks to-day? Curiously enough, though the Odyssey particularizes regarding these two of the Scogli, or Rocks, it says nothing whatever as to the other five of the group. Right here another picturesque legend dealing with Polyphemus develops. For miles along this shore, town after town has Aci prefixed to its name, as a reminder of the story of Galatea and Acis. Polyphemus - huge, gross, uncouth monster - had no attraction for the dainty nymph, but as so often happens in even the prosaic days of fact, his bulk did not keep him from loving Galatea passionately. So when - if one may be irreverently colloquial - the shepherd boy Acis \\u201ccut him out,\\u201d Polyphemus crushed him to death with stones in Galatea\\u2019s bower. Olympus heard her piteous mourning, and from the lifeblood of Acis sprang a crystal stream which imparted its life to the fields of Catania until jealous \\u00c6tna drank it up. But Acis lives in spite of the giant. Acireale, Acicastello, Aci San Antonio - how quaintly pagan and Christian myths mingle in the Latin countries! - and many another Aci perpetuate him. Acireale, about ten miles from Catania on the main line of the railroad to Taormina, is a pleasant place to make a stay. Its mineral springs, the delightful views by sea and shore, the walks and drives in every direction through surroundings of the keenest interest and beauty, and, for those who are fond of the water, the little boat trips in the vicinity, make it a most agreeable spot in which to idle during the soft Sicilian Spring. \\n\\n\\nXII TAORMINA \\nSicilian railroad trains have the very amiable - or would some people spell that word exasperating? - habit of never running according to schedule. One is tempted at times to wonder why they have a time-table at all! Express or local, the train is always either too late or too early. You may take your choice of reaching the station well ahead of the \\u201cdue\\u201d time, and vegetating until the little locomotive sniffles shamefacedly in, away late, or going on time and finding the carriage doors locked, the train ready to leave, and the guards very much disinclined to open for you. A jingling of one\\u2019s pocket usually unlocks the doors in such circumstances, however. Did I say, \\u201cexpress or local\\u201d? Which it is is a puzzle, since it is all one. The \\u201clocal\\u201d part of the train has to rush madly by stations whenever the \\u201cexpress\\u201d part does; and the \\u201cexpress\\u201d half is obliged to halt whenever the \\u201clocal\\u201d end comes to a station it especially likes. Which train you ride in depends entirely on the label that happens to be on your car! But even with these vagaries, the railways are good, the employ\\u00e9s courteous, usually amenable to jingling reason, and the service unusually safe. A railroad inspector I talked with explained this safety tersely. \\u201cItalians or Sicilians would not matter. But, per Baccho, to smash up foreigners - we can\\u2019t afford it!\\u201d As to that, their private reasons are none of our affair. That we can feel safe, and be safe, is the main thing. The day we came to Taormina we reached the station too early, and a miracle occurred. The train was early, too - fifteen minutes too early! - and we secured an excellent compartment and waited. That was decidedly too early to go ahead with safety, so engineer and conductor strolled about town making friendly calls, a trainman had an ap\\u00e9ritif at a nearby caff\\u00e9, and we started at last in leisurely fashion - five minutes behind time. The station is Giardini-Taormina, at the sea level; and Giardini, though theoretically Taormina\\u2019s \\u201charbor,\\u201d is only a little fishing village. Yet here twenty-five centuries ago the first of Sicily\\u2019s deliverers, the noble Timoleon of Corinth, landed to begin the work that built him such fame and gave Sicily such liberty. And in 1860 the second Deliverer, Giuseppe Garibaldi, after completing his work in Sicily, embarked here for Reggio di Calabria to continue his campaign of liberation on the Italian mainland. Nowadays nobody stops to look at Giardini twice, since far above, on the great cliffs against which it nestles, lies the favorite beauty spot of Sicily, the haunt of artist and traveler the year around. If you so much as look doubtfully at the rickety old landaus that meet the train, a driver will pile your luggage into one, almost push you in after it, and cracking his whip, start slowly up the road, a long, gentle ascent built in great sweeping curves. Splendid views unveil themselves at every foot of the way. Below lies the sea, ranging from transparent, broken-edged emerald at the beach, to fathomless azure in the depths, and a dull, dusty, almost colorless void at the horizon. It is streaked with wind-paths, flecked with tiny whitecaps, dotted with fishing boats flitting about like white bats, while far up the Strait where Italy seems to reach over and embrace its lovely sister, it is easy to imagine Scylla and Charybdis reaching out hungry, gleaming hands for the hapless voyagers rashly passing between. It is hard to think of anything else than the Argonauts, even amid the beauty of wild and cultivated flowers, vegetation clinging tenaciously to the face of the cliffs, or growing in luxuriance upon terraces in lovely banked and esplanaded gardens. Picturesque villas of every type range all the way from the usual bare, square, white hut-style to artists\\u2019 abominations in all manner of castellated, battlemented, machicolated forms. A turn in the road opens a matchless vista of \\u00c6tna; another, - and squarely in front glimmers the red and tan ruin of the Greek Theater, perched high upon the jutting crest of a mound from which the spectators of the play had magnificent views to amuse them in case they tired of the work of the chorus. Standing on tiptoe at the very edges of precipitous acclivities big, pleasant looking hotels peer down with staring window-eyes, very attractive, but a trifle suggestive of what might happen should the edge of some particular precipice crumble off. If you have been staying all along the way at the usual Swiss hotels with their familiar Franco-German cooking, why not try a genuinely Sicilian hostelry for once! Such quarters are to be found on the main street, in a hotel which wanders up and down the hillside in an ungainly series of overlapping stories and queer detached turrets and belvederes. From the street, the entrance looks very much like a black hole in the wall. It is exactly the same as the door of a little carpenter shop alongside, with the single exception of an inscription in faded paint: Ristorante. The greatest charm of the place is a garden, which rambles about partly on the level, partly down steep little banks, and then, in the rear, rolls up to a stone wall beyond which is one of the milky white roads of the country. It is crammed with the wildest sort of tangled climbing roses, tiny things the rich color of a Mar\\u00e9chal Niel but no bigger than a ten-cent piece; large red, yellow, pink and white roses; splendid geraniums, orange trees, lemons, medlars, almonds, stubby agaves, prickly pear, pink-flowered climbing cactus, and wonder of wonders, even a pair of apple trees! Ivy, numerous other vines and brilliant convolvulus riot about them all, while down the center runs a path under lemon-arches half smothered in rose bloom. Beside this walk is a trellis bower covered with thousands of the tiny yellow roses, and furnished with a marble-topped table and an iron chair - an ideal literary workshop. But alas! the village tinsmith evidently shared my prejudice in its favor. When I came out prepared to work he had already pre\\u00ebmpted it for his mechanical workshop, and was filling the air with clatter and the noxious fumes of smoldering charcoal as he knocked together watering-pots to keep the garden green. There are so many means of communication between the wings and the dining-room that it is very easy to lose one\\u2019s self. Beware the kitchen stair especially, where a large, plump, elderly, and exceedingly dignified goat often blocks the way. Try to push her gently aside, and you are astonished to find how heavy and strong a goat is. Take her firmly by her stump of a tail and one horn, to hoist her bodily, and the proverbial pig under the stile could make no more distressing noise. Among those who hear is the cook. Full of apologies, and unheeding terrific protests, she grabs at the animal\\u2019s beard and a horn or leg, and literally yanks her inside. But the moment she lets go, Signora Goat bounces out again as though on the end of a rubber band. Taormina is bound to the green hillside by one long, curving white ribbon of a street, with flying tag-ends of alleys and byways. This Corso Vittorio Emmanuele is the artery that carries the thin but pulsing tide of the town\\u2019s affairs, a narrow, wind-swept chasm, but far from being a dull one. Traffic is brisk, and the tiny shops, whose dark interiors are scarcely more than visible, do a lively trade with the townsfolk and contadini. Here and there a curio store - Taormina lives and fattens on the gullible foreigner, be he collector, artist, or traveler only - displays a great stringful of pottery hung beside the door to tempt the unwary browsing antiquary with tangible memories of \\u201cthe glory that was Greece.\\u201d All about artistic decay is embayed by square, ugly, utilitarian buildings which the natives consider more practical than the exquisite finery of their noble predecessors. The very unexpectedness with which delicate bits of ruin appear constitutes one of the town\\u2019s greatest charms. Yet happy in its isolation is the Badia Vecchia, a bit of fine old crumbling, machicolated stone tower once the nunnery of Taormina, surrounded by a brilliant patch of lavender-flowered cactus among the trees on the irregular hillside above the town. Roofless and abandoned, it stands outlined in soft brown against the cobalt sky, its delicate windows still bordered by snowy marble diapering, its walls partly checkered in black lava and white marble, a noble Gothic picture, saturated with the atmosphere of Norman days. A rugged, winding path leads up this hillside to the ancient castle, crowning a crag far above, though the usual route is by way of Mola. To-day the chief importance of the castle is as a platform for viewing the stirring panorama of shore and hills. Just beyond Giardini on a little promontory now covered by a luxuriant lemon plantation, those ardent pioneers under Theocles - it seems hardly fair to call them pirates, as some writers have done - established Naxos, the elder sister of all Greek colonies in Sicily, in 735 B.C. One thing of especial interest about Naxos is that outside its walls on what quickly became neutral ground, the colonists erected an altar and shrine to Apollo Archegetes, not merely the patron of Naxos, but the patron of all Hellenic Sicily. Hither all the Greeks could come in safety for a blessing ere departing on a journey, no matter what internecine strife might rage in the island. The athletes and patrons of the Olympic and Isthmian Games came here before sailing, to secure the favor of the god in their endeavors to wrest the laurel from their brethren of Greece. Naxos, however, was short-lived compared with the other cities. In 476 B. C., the Tyrant Hieron of Syracuse, who might well be called \\u201cthe juggler of colonies,\\u201d forcibly depopulated it and resettled its inhabitants in the city of Leontinoi. This seems to have been a favorite amusement of tyrants. To satisfy a passing whim, or as a means of punishment, the tyrant of the moment would calmly compel some unfortunate community to move in a hurry to a spot of his own choosing. However, there seem to have been people living in Naxos seventy-three years later, for we read that in 403 Dionysius destroyed it completely, and ever since it has existed only as a name, as the first milestone along the path of the superior incoming Greek civilization that made Sicily great. The Taormina castle, by the way, is an excellent vantage point from which to pick out the places to which excursions may be made, and there are many very attractive ones - by boat, on foot, or on donkeyback, to Capo di Taormina and Capo di Sant\\u2019Andrea, where the coast is pock-marked with curious grottoes, to Monte Venere, to Monte Zirreto, and to many another local beauty spot. In Sicily you must not believe everything you think you hear - and above all, you must not act rashly upon such an impression. When a Sicilian is feeling well, his \\u201cGood morning, sir!\\u201d sounds like \\u201cSpartacus to the gladiators.\\u201d When anyone addresses you as though murder were contemplated, with yourself as the victim, be easy. It is most likely to be a polite wish for a pleasant journey, delivered with characteristic Latin fervor and inflection. Our first morning in Taormina, a wild looking peasant beauty bearing upon her shapely head a huge dripping amphora, stopped us with uncouth gestures and a laugh so eldritch it startled us. Jerking her finger at La Signora, she poured forth a torrent of impassioned Sicilian dialect we failed to understand, though I thought she said we were folk unfit to be in Taormina and had better leave immediately. Unpleasant thoughts of the Maffiusi - the Mano Nera we loosely call them - swept through me. The girl\\u2019s utterance was so fierce, her expression so positively menacing, I wondered whether she might not be really an agent of the dreaded band. But before my combined annoyance and alarm led me into difficulties, two Taorminians came up and explained in Italian: \\u201cThe signorita is afraid your Signora will lose her handkerchief. It is falling out of her belt.\\u201d I was glad I had not shouted for the police! When I asked the girl, who could understand Italian perfectly, though she spoke none herself, if I might photograph her, she consented without a trace of her former ferocity and - with a self-respect unfortunately rare in Taormina - refused any gratuity, merely wishing us a torrential good day as she vanished up the black and smoky stairs of a stone hut on one of the side streets. It is a pity the town has not more like her. The Taorminians display comparatively little of the simple geniality and charm of the Palermitans, little of their bright-faced innocence and heartiness. At first it is hard to understand why, since they are no less Sicilian than their fellows of the capital. But a slight acquaintance with them will convince the most casual observer that they have learned their own value only too well as replicas of Greek and Roman and Saracenic beauty. Consequently many of them have turned from simple hill folk into insincere, lazy, professional poseurs, alert for camera or pencil, and lost forever to the childlike graces that distinguish their brothers. And not only are the people replicas of the past, but their native music is reminiscent also - pure Greek melodies that have floated down the river of time from the days when Bion and Theocritus rambled these same hills and wrote songs eternally young; Saracenic love-songs full of the wild spirit of desert and river, quavering and melancholic; passionate lyric romances suggestive of cavalier Norman days. But it is the Greek that, being the purest and simplest strain, has always prevailed. Every day little shepherd lads stir the terrific solitudes of wind-swept mountain steeps with wordless songs drawn as by magic from their reedy flutes, music shrilly sweet and unforgettable. And at dinner in the evening you may hear some little minstrel wandering up and down the Corso, fluting his heart out in the moonlight. In your eagerness you peradventure hale him into the mysterious labyrinthine \\u201cGarden of the Moon\\u201d behind the hotel, where the silvery blue orb of a great arc-lamp glows among the interlacing almonds and medlars, and bid him play. But he is a shy, embarrassed Pan, stiff of finger, timid of lip until he forgets the listening bystanders. Then the magic pipe takes up again the silver strain. There is no hotel upon the mountainside, but only the melody, the moon-mellowed primeval forest, the slumbering forms of the little shepherd\\u2019s weary flock. The music ceases - the elfin charm is broken. Rudely over the fairy ring of your vision burst the ungentle voices of moderns in tailor-fashioned clothes, stiff boots and Paris hats, wearing no chaplets of ivy or acanthus upon ambrosial locks - and worst of all, some of them smoking cigarettes! One such night I pleaded with the little minstrel, urged him by strange and magic names he never knew, to let me have his reed. Reluctantly, unsmiling, he gave it up, and as I write, it lies close by. But alas, no more it knows the Grecian strain - it will not sing for me! \\n\\n\\nXIII SOME MOUNTAIN VISTAS \\nThe ignorance and illiteracy to which reference has already been made are the chief misfortunes of the Sicilians. Since schools are few and far between, little girls are taught only to sew, knit and cook. The boys, more unfortunate, receive little or no instruction at all - there is work for them as soon as they are old enough, and they are useful in the fields and about the stables and goatpens at six or eight. The children of wealthy or noble families seem to be regarded as superior beings who have to learn practically nothing, and who accordingly go through life unworried by knowing anything. A few years ago an English lady undertook to make Taormina over single handed, and though the town still has a long and thorny road to travel, the results the Hill School has accomplished in helping the people to help themselves have surpassed all anticipations, and prove that even with both heredity and environment against them, the people are willing to learn and to work when shown how. Within one of the dark doorways along the Corso is a typically Taorminian institution, a knitting school where little tots sit demurely knitting, crocheting or embroidering with faces as expressionless as the visages of so many trained kittens. The \\u201clady principal\\u201d comes forward graciously to welcome visitors in her tiny domain, and readily grants permission to make photographs. But the room is lighted only from the front door, and the little heads and bodies are so difficult to keep in repose for even a few seconds that photography is speedily abandoned for an inspection of the work of the pupils, babies of from three upward, except that occasionally an older girl takes a \\u201cpost graduate course\\u201d in fine embroidering. They click away industriously as their visitors pass along the line, and some do not even glance up, so thoroughly have they been drilled by the schoolmistress. Each juvenile knitter uses two long needles and wears a belt with a little leather plastron, in which the butt-end of the stationary needle rests, to protect the thinly clad little body from the prick of the sharp steel instrument. When we visited the school, I asked the teacher how much she charged for tuition. \\u201cTen cents a month each,\\u201d was her grave reply. \\u201cIt is much for some to pay.\\u201d \\u201cDoes that pay you?\\u201d She waved her hand at the circle of twenty-five pupils. \\u201cIt does!\\u201d The food of the people is intended to support life rather than gratify the palate. And though the little ones, like normal children anywhere in the world, are gifted with a sweet tooth, their desire for dolci is very, very seldom gratified. So when you loiter about the door of the little school, be sure to have a bag of sweet cakes with you - the bakers along the Corso all sell them. The \\u201clady principal\\u201d will gladly permit you to distribute the glistening, white-iced treasures, and you will be amply repaid in watching the pupils - the daintiness with which they accept and hold the proffered delicacies, the timid \\u201cGraz\\u2019, Signora! Graz\\u2019!\\u201d of each, the perfect restraint of eager eyes and mouths. A very important personage in this little mountain town is Signor Atenasio Pancrazio, banker, steamship agent, postal messenger, and storekeeper; and curious indeed are his business methods. On four days which we noticed especially because of a desire to get at some of Signor Atenasio\\u2019s money, he opened his bank-store at the somewhat irregular and unusual hours of eleven-thirty, a quarter before nine, noon, and twenty minutes past three. And then, to make the hours appear still less like a matter of sordid business for gain, the gentleman threw wide his doors on a Sunday morning and kept open shop, bank and house until long after everybody but the ubiquitous tourist had gone to bed. Banker though he is, the good gentleman has ideas above mere money-making, and if you are content to sit at his feet in the big, dim counting-room - which smells of cheese and wine, of garlic and rubber-stamp ink - you can learn much about the Sicilian problem, which is as perplexing to the Italian Government as the Irish bogy is to Downing Street. When absentee landlordism is combined with ignorance and poverty, it makes a problem indeed. The agricultural system is very old. It had its inception as long ago as the days when Pope Gregory the Great was one of the most important proprietors in the island, in the name and person of the Church. He was a good and careful landlord, but others are the opposite, and the system, always unjust, has degenerated. At the present time an estate is nominally managed on behalf of the owner by a factor, who most often re-rents it to someone else. This third person in turn, not wishing to cultivate it personally, leases it in small patches to the farmer at exorbitant rates, or to a fourth factor, who repeats the operation. Thus when the peasant finally comes into possession of his acres, he is paying so heavy a rental that it is practically impossible to do more than make his actual expenses. Driven to desperation by such a condition and often in actual need, he has recourse to the money-lender, who loans readily - and collects with grim certainty, practically enslaving the wretched farmer. The usurers grow rich, but they hoard up their evil fortunes, keeping the money out of circulation, and the country is the poorer. Naturally the steamship office becomes the most important place in towns where discontent prevails. The companies have men ready to answer all questions, and more than willing to encourage the peasant to give up his hardly earned savings, providing he is physically sound. Indeed, they even send glib and persuasive agents about to drum up trade in likely districts by painting glowing pictures of the golden streets of America. \\u201cSignor Atenasio,\\u201d I said, \\u201cyou are a steamship agent yourself. Do you go about and make trade this way?\\u201d \\u201cThe holy Saint Pancratius forbid!\\u201d he exclaimed, piously calling upon his patron. But he spoiled the effect by adding instantly: \\u201cNo, I do not have to. I get all the trade there is in Mola anyway. It is very little,\\u201d he shrugged, and turned the subject. This Mola, the tiny town on the hilltop above Taormina, may be cited as a typical example of what taxes, lack of education, usury, and as a consequence, emigration, are doing for Sicily to-day. Though Mola lies only about a thousand feet higher up in the air than Taormina, it is ten times as far away by foot - and by foot you must go, \\u201ceither your own or another donkey\\u2019s!\\u201d as one weary but none the less enthusiastic visitor put it on returning. The road - a good part of it is low stone steps, the round, flat pebbles set on edge in mortar - winds along the uncertain sides of the little valleys, and since not a single tree of any size shades it from an almost tropical sun at full power, it is sufficiently trying. Here and there a female beggar pops up most unexpectedly to demand an alms \\u201cfor the love of the blessed Christ who walked thus to Calvary!\\u201d The town curves in a semi-circle around the top of the hill, behind the battered remains of stout old walls which even to-day are massive and in places almost perfect, and might be turned to excellent account in defense. Just where the road skirts the base of the cliff, one night in December of 1677, forty stout-hearted native soldiers scaled the wall - when you look up at it, it seems an impossible feat - with ropes, and surprised and captured the French garrison then in possession. The highly picturesque entrance by a carved archway under a bit of wall leading outward at right angles from the overhanging cliff is commanded by an equally picturesque evil-looking iron smooth-bore cannon. So still is Mola that the old lines fit it perfectly: \\u201cSunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all, And the long grass o\\u2019ertops the moldering wall; And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler\\u2019s hand, Far, far away, thy children leave the land.\\u201d It is literally the \\u201cDeserted Village.\\u201d Half an hour suffices to explore the Corso - even tiny Mola has its highway named for the King! - and all the silent high- and by-ways from end to end; mere gradini, crooked and steep, slits between out-of-plumb houses whose only occupants seem to be pigs. The biggest, blackest, dirtiest and leanest razorbacks imaginable march solemnly up and down the front steps of the best houses, or snore comfortably inside on the parlor floor. Occasionally a savage mother with her little shoats takes up a good share of the way, snapping viciously at anyone who ventures too close. Our \\u201cguide,\\u201d a mere baby, offered to go and stir up such a family when he saw me about to take its picture, and nearly lost a leg for his pains. But in all these streets not a man is visible of adult years and able to work. Only at the \\u201cCathedral\\u201d can vigorous men be seen, the verger and the priest. The whereabouts of the others are told in the single magic word that spells so much to all Europe - \\u201cAmerica!\\u201d It is literally true. Of all the male inhabitants only those too poor, too feeble to make the long trip, or too young to be acceptable as toilers, have remained at home. Even the exceptions, the verger and the priest, gaze seaward with longing eyes. The \\u201cCathedral\\u201d is a building to make the heart ache. Poor and ignorant though they are, the people strive with cheap, garish colors and hideous decorations to please the Deity as well as to give their lowly church the air of a rich-folks\\u2019 Cathedral. What grips one most is to be found in the sacristy. Tied tightly to the arm of a much betinseled Mary Magdalen is a beautiful and amazingly thick braid of human hair. What is the tragedy behind the oblation? What poor little girl from Mola came cowering and repentant to the feet of the saint and fastened the simple ex-voto in broken-hearted gratitude to the arm of her who wept over the sacred feet and wiped them with her hair? Is it a local tragedy or one from across the unfathomable seas? The verger pretends he does not know. Yet as you wander through the unkempt streets of the deserted village, you cannot help looking curiously about for any woman whose head shows the trace of the votive shears. Many a time throughout Italy we had been tormented by filthy beggars on the steps of the cathedrals; but it was reserved for Mola to show us a pig who owned to being a pig in such a place! As we came out a huge, lean razorback grunted in savage disapproval, lurched to his feet, and trotted heavily off down a side street. If the ascent to Mola is difficult, what can be said of the coming down? You stretch muscles you never knew you had, all the corns in the world seem to have concentrated upon your luckless feet, and you pitch and roll and toss like a mastless ship in a cross-sea. After that Mola trip the most energetic traveler is apt to go to bed very early, and so for the first time hears the night noises of Taormina. The town makes quite a clatter on its way to bed - the click! click! click! of hobnailed heels on the lava pavement, the light chatter and songs of the children, which for all their occasional gayety have an elusive element of the tragic in them, the fluting of some little shepherd, and the tired bray of a home-going donkey glad the day\\u2019s work is over. And every half-hour the bell-baiting! Would that Poe had heard these Sicilian bells before he wrote his tintinnabulating rhyme. Beaten, not rung, they clamor with the maddening insistence of fiends until the ear rebels and no longer notices their angry tumult. One tradition has it that there is not a bell-clapper in the island, for the returning French took the iron tongues away after the Massacre of the Vespers, to keep the people from ringing alarms. But the ingenious Sicilian found that he could make much more noise with a hammer, and though six hundred years and more have rolled by, he is still so tickled with the racket that he seems each time to be trying to break all previous records. A more plausible story is that the clappers were taken away by the Neapolitans as recently as the day of Garibaldi\\u2019s arrival with his thousand red-shirts in 1860. Save for the bell-baiting only, silence reigns from about ten until two. Then the first donkey\\u2019s tiny little overburdened feet come ticking down the Corso, the whack of his rider\\u2019s stick and an occasional gruff adjuration to the patient little mouse-colored beast recurring in a regular work-motif. Slowly the light begins to come. A sleepy ringer bangs out fifty irregular notes from his bell, hesitates a moment as though not quite certain of his count, and adds one last vigorous clang for good measure. Chanticleer first awakes the echoes, in strenuous rivalry with stentorian peacocks. Again silence reigns for half an hour or so. Then Taormina turns in bed, stirs luxuriously, yawns, and \\u201cgets busy.\\u201d Along the Corso donkeys bearing slim wine-casks and great tins of goats\\u2019 milk patter past at a smart pace; vegetable hawkers from the piana shout their wares into open doorways; cats and chickens side by side strike out into the daylight from the obscurity of their shelters, stretching and flapping comfortably. Children, standing like models of Justice, scales and weights in hand, call their merchandise, weigh and measure with preternatural gravity, or eye older hucksters sharply as the latter use their own scales to weight out a \\u201cpenorth\\u201d of this or a \\u201chaporth\\u201d of that. These street views are keenly interesting, but after all it is \\u00c6tna that makes Taormina an artist\\u2019s paradise. Travelers and artists alike come for a brief glimpse or a sketch of \\u00c6tna, return again and again, or perchance find the fascination of hoary crown and delicate lights and shades so irresistible they settle down in the volcano\\u2019s shadow and remain for years, proclaiming Taormina to be the rarest beauty spot in creation. One of the American artists who came twenty years ago and has never been able to tear himself away from the thrall of the great cold peak, shows his studies of its moods, a great stack of marvelous water colors made at dawn, at noon, at sunset, at every hour of day and night, with every whimsical effect cloud or sun or shadow could give as he sat at his easel in a white-walled garden with the perpetually beautiful before him as a model. Perhaps the most remarkable contrasts are from a perfectly moonlight night to a clear dawn the next morning. All night the moon, sailing in solemn round overhead, tints the peak\\u2019s snowy shoulders with a faint greenish tinge that makes it the wraith of a volcano. A little before four o\\u2019clock, slowly, tenderly, moon and pallid stars dwindle into spookish reflections of themselves as the sky lightens, the velvet blue of the night puckers into gelid gray, changes into pale turquoise through which majestically sail a vast fleet of enormous fluffy clouds, while \\u00c6tna rises dark and forbidding from the piana below. Graciously a faint flush in the eastern sky increases in volume, deepens in tone; the grim pile of the volcano on the west darkens at the top, and as the ineffable pink spreads around behind it, the cone turns dead and spectral, and the thin, cottony tuft of curling smoke above the main crater eddies upward with all the seeming of steam on a foggy winter\\u2019s morning. These first changes come with the measured caution of a master painter working carefully lest through some hasty stroke he spoil the effect of the tone picture to come. The light spreads. Neither camera nor pen can keep pace with the instantaneous transformations on every side. The vast crimson-coppery disc sails slowly up in majesty to eye the little world of Taormina from behind the inky green shoulder of the Greek Theater\\u2019s hill. The upper edges of the clouds turn pink and silver; the lower, soft salmon pink, saffron, orange, gold. It is day! There is something awe-inspiring, archaic, terrible about it all. It suggests the ancient Egyptian belief of Amen-ra riding through the horrible fastnesses of the Tuat in his sacred boat, and emerging in the glory of the resurrection. It is a chilly performance of a spring morning, and a hungry one. At a quarter before six, an eight o\\u2019clock breakfast seems at a starving distance; so the best thing to do is to come down into the street to see the milk being delivered. Right, left, and everywhere are nothing but goats! goats! goats! the whole length of the Corso; by twos, singly, in herds of twenty or more, with a pair of fractious kids roped together under their mother\\u2019s usually wide open, yellow old eye, or tied one to each hind leg, very much to mother\\u2019s discomfort. They burst out upon the Corso from narrow little gradini as if they had been kicked out of Mola on the crags above, and had not been able to check their speed on the long roll down. The tobacconist whose shop is directly opposite the hotel, opens at dawn to catch the early trade of the Mola goatherds in snuff and sigari. If you catch his eye he will throw wide both arms to include all the goats on the Corso, and exclaim: \\u201cLatte de\\u2019capri \\u00e8 molto bell\\u2019!\\u201d Take his gracefully conveyed hint, and ask for a glass. One of the ragazze - two-thirds at least of the goatherds in Taormina and Mola are young girls - milks a rich, warm, foaming pint. Whatever your misgivings, the tobacconist is quite right - \\u201cMilk of goats is very beautiful!\\u201d - very grateful to a cold and empty stomach. The hotel is quite civilized, the honest goatherd milking his animals into bottles which he carries in under the eye of a servant whose business it is to see that there is no adulteration or watering. In the private houses still more scrupulous care is observed. Many a protesting goat is compelled to scramble up as many as four or five flights of dark and difficult stairs to be milked in the \\u201cparlor\\u201d into the suspicious or indolent housewife\\u2019s own can or bottle. The Taorminians are worried by no inspectors or supervision of their milk supply, for the purchasers are their own supervisors, and milk is one thing in Sicily absolutely above reproach. \\n\\n\\nXIV LIGHTS AND SHADES \\nFountains in Sicily occupy much the same place in the life of the people that the forum occupied in a Roman community of old. That is, the fountain and its piazza are the center for exchanging news and gossip, for recreation, for all the varied diversions the people have in common. Taormina\\u2019s principal fountain lies just outside the old wall, not far from the Porta Catania, the gate facing toward Catania. About the cool and dripping basin gather the graceful young peasant girls, balancing incredibly large and heavy amphorai of water upon their well poised heads; pretty, kittenish children and grimgaunt old rheumatic gossips; loutish waterboys in from the piana with their great barrel-carts to take the ichor of the gods back home; and generally the background for all is a fringe of seedy, admiring youths, casting sheeps\\u2019 eyes at the girls and wondering how long it will be until they can get married - or sail for America! This particular fountain is crowned by the arms of Taormina, which consist of the twin castles of Mola and Taormina, and a mythological creature with the body of a bull, the tail of a fish and the head of a woman. Exactly what this beast is would tax the powers of the most ingenious of zoologists to explain - possibly a \\u201cnature-faker\\u201d could do it better. From the Porta Catania the old town wall, perhaps twenty feet in height, rambles up the hillside in weird curves and abrupt angles, following the contour of the ground. Now that it is useless as a defense the thrifty Taorminians have built up a row of tiny houses which cling limpet fashion to the outside of the sturdy old masonry, through which windows have been driven that add greatly to its picturesqueness. Wonderful climbing bougainsvilleas and other vines have sprung up from the fertile soil and spread their graceful tendrils higher and higher until almost every window is smothered in a mass of tender greenery and blossom. To see these picturesque cottages is to wish to end one\\u2019s days in one, or at least to bring some of its perfume and beauty back home. Near by a steep gradino is a floral waterfall. On the house-sides, festooning every post and projecting bit of masonry, brilliant flowers foam in pink spray, as from some perfumed fountain farther up the hill where roses distil their spicy fragrance from long, nodding branches. Facing its own little piazza inside the wall, and just below the Corso, is the Cathedral, which has a fine fourteenth century Gothic side portal. Perhaps the service is fourteenth century, too. It is conducted by the parish priest, a withered old man of grim and ascetic aspect, who drones in out-of-key nasals through the ritual, his voice drowned out a good deal of the time by the wheezy old organ, played by the village cobbler. The choir consists of the verger and another man who appears and disappears like a jack-in-the-box; at no time are more than two men visible in the organ loft, but in their vigor they quite make up for lack of numbers or inspiration. On the opposite side of the choir rises what seems to be a larger and more imposing organ. It is really nothing but a huge stretcher of canvas on which an instrument is painted, evidently to impress visitors with the dignity and grandeur of this mountain church. When we were at service the good padre was assisted in his ministrations by the verger - when he was not singing - who worked with a becoming sense of the dignity of his position, and by an impish little acolyte in flaming scarlet, who hopped about like a cricket. If ever there was a little rascal who deserved excommunication for his pranks, it was this juvenile mischief-maker, who swung his censer so as almost to choke the old priest, keeping a more watchful eye upon the strangers than upon his business, and scarcely stopping to crook an irreverent little knee as he passed about in front of the altar. Once, stooping to rearrange the priest\\u2019s robes, he did it with such a mischievous flirt, and such a droll gleam in the brown eyes fixed on us, that we half expected to be held up by a small highwayman after mass, and asked for a penny or two in token of the sacrilegious show we had been permitted to witness. The elders of the town sit upon the long bench or dais of red porphyry where the archbishop would be enthroned should he visit Taormina. They are curious old men, gnarled, withered apples full of sun and wind-wrinkles, who wear the typical brown-gray-black shawl as a muffler. Below them, on the throne\\u2019s lowest step, squat several of the oldest women in the town. Over this seat a large and imposing shield bearing the arms of Taormina is supported by a time-stained oaken eagle, who leers with side-cocked head and an expression of inebriate gravity in his partly closed eyes. He seems more a gargoyle, a grotesque, than a strictly appropriate bit of ecclesiastical decoration. Some of the peasant girls in the congregation are very lovely - perfect young Madonnas; sloe-eyed, raven-haired; with exquisite features and coloring, and distinctly Greek profiles. But they are not all dark; there is also the florid blonde type the Latin peoples so greatly admire, though it cannot bear comparison with the other. All of them dress with a taste and a restraint hardly to be expected among mountain folk only a few degrees removed from the primitive. Here and there a fawn-like maid has thrown a Roman scarf with broad orange bands lightly over her hair, its vivid colors in pleasing contrast with her simple dark blue dress, piped with white, and the usual black silk apron that distinguishes her as of a prosperous family. About through the throng in the nave the worshipers\\u2019 children run freely to and fro, laughing, crying, talking, calling to one another. Some gather in little colonies on a step of the door at the foot of the church and eye the scene with baby solemnity; and even when the Host is elevated, some dainty nymph of three or four may unconcernedly clatter higgledy-piggledy across the tiles in hobnailed shoon that wake the ancient echoes, crying at the top of her small voice: \\u201cPap\\u00e1! Pap\\u00e1!\\u201d to an old farmer entering the door. There is an indescribably moving something in the spectacle these poor folk present as they sit and stand and kneel and make the responses with the utter devotion of ignorance and superstition. Still, the outside can not be forgotten, even in the ecclesiastical atmosphere, and as the big bell up in the campanile booms the hour clear and mellow through the sound of voice and instrument, the world, the flesh and the devil stir the worshipers with a restless little movement of anxiety to get back into the sunshine again. The eagle over the bishop\\u2019s throne would appear to greater advantage in the funerals to be met on the Corso, conducted by the Fraternity of the Misericordia, which originated in Florence so many centuries ago. Weird indeed is one of these processions, as it ambles leisurely along through the heavy dust, often stirred by a light sirocco which flaps the robes and sends the incense smoke eddying upward in sacerdotal wreaths. Tragedy and farce clasp hands in the pitiful cort\\u00e9ge. The boy members of the Guild amuse themselves and shock the beholder by pulling their ghastly masks awry, contorting their faces into uncouth grimaces, and winking portentously through the large eyeholes. The men are scarcely better - even the pall-bearers laugh, joke, turn freely to pass a word with some acquaintance in the street or up in a window, and tilt the casket so recklessly that the cross and crown on top slip about and all but fall off. Their white frocks are too short, and from beneath the skirts protrude very baggy trouser-legs, dirty socks, or even a few inches of bare leg thrust hastily into shoes donned for the nonce, and left with strings dangling in the dust. Inquisitive goats and uncertain chickens get in the way and are either lifted to one side, carried along and petted for a few moments, or gently pushed out of the way with a kindly foot. Strange indeed was a double funeral we saw one sultry afternoon. At the head marched the ancient Guild, bearing a curious double cross, perhaps eight feet high and apparently very heavy. Nailed to its upper limb - askew, of course - was a small light cross. Behind the men walked eighteen little girls in ordinary street dress, and after them six older girls in black, marching in couples, each pair carrying a large floral wreath. The middle pair bore their wreath with an air that did not distinguish the others, since it surrounded a framed picture of the dead man. Directly behind the picture came a priest, his hands clasped over a missal which he held firmly against his well-fed stomach. After the living, the dead - the first of the coffins was a tiny one of flaming pink, stolidly handled by four sturdy lads of the Guild, who took as much interest in it and the proceedings as though they were bearing a crate of lemons to market. Immediately behind, four unusually tall Guildmen bore the man\\u2019s coffin, large and black, with a cross and a silver crown resting upon it. On either side trudged the womenfolk of the family, one in each file carrying a smoking plate of incense that nearly choked her, while two files of friends brought up the rear of the procession proper, followed by the usual rabble. Through the heavy African air the cathedral bells tolled with an inexpressibly sad intonation as the little cavalcade passed along the street. But even the relatives were compelled to laugh when from the rear, running at full speed, came a panting boy of about ten bearing the canonicals of the officiating priest. The robe flapped behind in most undignified fashion, one corner occasionally raising a little spurt of dust as it swept the stones; and every few steps the boy yelped an unintelligible sound, to bid the marchers slow down and let him catch up before the priest entered the cathedral. However, the touch of the ridiculous that turns tears to laughter is never far away in Sicily. Turning into a side street, one of those little gradini or flights of slippery stone steps which make up most of Taormina\\u2019s lesser byways, and thinking only of the funeral, we were suddenly halted by two of the juvenile troubadours who lie in wait for strangers, or patrol the streets, seeking whom they may charm. They sprang out at our approach, struck tragic attitudes, and began to shout out an old pirate song at the top of their thin little pipes. Lustily they sang, till the veins in their small foreheads bulged blue with the effort, screaming out the bloodthirsty words of the ancient ditty with gusto, and acting their parts like veterans. It was all so sudden, so utterly ludicrous, that we laughed until we cried. The moment we began to laugh, the larger boy frowned, stopped singing, and shaking his pudgy fist at us indignantly, announced: \\u201cI am a singer! A very good singer - you listen to me!\\u201d No cosmopolitan tenor could have put more outraged dignity and temperament into a protest. But sturdily they began all over. Here and there we caught a phrase about a wicked captain who stole a lovely maiden from her doting parents and took her away on his rakish barque to rove the smiling seas. Before I could reward them a large boy, who had kept away the crowd during the singing of the infant highwaymen, touched me on the arm. \\u201cSignore - you should pay me all. I....\\u201d \\u201cOh-ho! So you think you are their impresario, do you?\\u201d I demanded. \\u201cSissignore! Si! Si!\\u201d he exclaimed joyfully, not in the least understanding anything but that I seemed willing to play into his hands. \\u201cAre you a relative of the great Hammerstein?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cProbably, sir. I do not know. Does the gentleman live in Taormina?\\u201d Just then an ancient crone, toothless, and gifted, if anyone ever was, with the \\u201cevil eye,\\u201d pinched my arm with a vigor astonishing in so aged a creature, and shrilly demanded her gift. Annoyed, I asked her as gently as possible, while the crowd grinned in derision: \\u201cBut what have you done that I should pay you?\\u201d \\u201cDone!\\u201d she retorted. \\u201cDone! It is enough - am I not here?\\u201d Declining to pay for being pinched, we worked our way slowly through the tenacious rabble - which clamored for soldi - down into the courtyard of the hotel that was once a pious house of prayer and fasting, the gray and ancient Convento di San Domenico. Beyond the edge of the older town it poises its massive stone bulk, whitewashed and scrupulously neat, on the ragged edge of the cliff: where fragrant roses climb all about and potted plants fringe the balustrades on all sides with rich color. It is a joy to sit here and take tea, with the marvelous panorama of storied coast and slumbering sea directly beneath. San Domenico is as cold as it is lovely, and the guests are hardly to be envied their rooms, once the silent stone cells of the monks. They are, however, to be envied the charm of the great hall with its carven choir stalls and lecturn, and the beautiful flower-decked cloisters. But where the crumbling Byzantine arcades once echoed with the Vesper, the Matin and the Ave, now is heard only the laughter of the heedless tourist, the chatter of children, the swish of skirts, and the click of the camera-shutter. From the stone balustrades of the terrace, one gazes down upon slopes thorny with the spikes of the prickly pear, toothed and spurred with many an ugly rock that must have been there when the intrepid tyrant, Dionysius I, led his storming party up the slopes one winter night in 394 B. C., and forced his way into the very marketplace, only to be repulsed by the heroic citizens and come tumbling down - literally, it is said - six hundred feet among the rocks and thorns of the snowy ascent. No wonder Dionysius hated Taormina after that! He disliked it before, and his little impromptu toboggan filled him with a tyrant\\u2019s decision to even things with Taormina sooner or later. Four years afterward he kept his oath, in an outburst of savage fury that reduced the hamlet to ruins but failed to injure it permanently. The moldering palace of the once mighty Dukes of Santo Stefano is also at this western end of the town. But all there is to see is a garden, tangled and sweet, a deep well whose carven curb speaks eloquently of the love of its former masters for the beautiful, and a barren earthen room under the palace, where dingy mosaics upon the stucco walls peep through the grime of ages. In one corner is a mortared pit about thirty inches deep and two feet in diameter. The caretaker is contemptuous at any failure to understand so simple a thing as an ancient bath, and displays the superior air of one who, however economical she may herself be in the use of such a luxury, is thoroughly versed in the theory of its employment by others of less Spartan virtue. Beyond this - nothing! The key is in Palermo. With the characteristic fondness of Sicilians for separating buildings and their keys, the Duke leaves it in the capital, so the Greek and Roman marbles stripped ruthlessly from the Theater at the other end of town are usually invisible. But though they may not be visible, the Theater from which they were taken is very much so. The Corso on the way is always a human and animal kaleidoscope. Here a man holds his grateful horse by the bridle while his wife lifts a black iron soup kettle to give the weary beast a drink of warm and nourishing soup made of bread, vegetables and goats\\u2019 milk. Yonder a demoralized old cat licks her kittens into shape on a shady doorstep while a venerable hen looks on and seems to have a proprietary interest in seeing the work properly performed. Cats and kittens and dogs lie jumbled together, in genial disregard of the usual enmities, suggesting the lion and the lamb parable. Quaintly dressed peasants from the piana stare at the visitor, and vendors of antiquities call lazily from their black little holes in the wall, advertising their strings of \\u201cancient\\u201d pottery, that rattle ominously whenever a wisp of breeze playfully tugs at them. A carriage-full of tourists Baedekering through Sicily passes literally on the jump, with craned necks and vociferous consultation of the fat little red books so essential to comfort in this land where no one is willing to confess that he really knows anything positively. Water-carts creak by, a huckster whose wares are not yet all sold bellows most musical of \\u201cA-a-ar - ca - cio-o-o - fi-i-i-i!\\u201d and from behind comes the mellow boom of the cathedral chimes knelling away the brilliant hour. Artists with easels and sketching kits lumber heavily by on their way back from the Theater, the only great ruin of which Taormina can boast. There is little now in the shattered playhouse to make alive its glories of Greek days, for as it stands it is largely a Roman ruin. The conquerors built amphitheaters throughout the island, but their theaters were in almost every instance merely enlargements or adaptations of older structures. Here in Taormina the building shows perfectly what the Romans did with the stage, which is in an almost perfect state of preservation. The playhouse, hewn in great part from the living rock, measures three hundred fifty-seven feet in its greatest diameter, while the diameter of the pit or orchestra is no less than one hundred and fifteen feet. The stage itself is quite narrow, with a vaulted channel or passage underneath for the water, used in flooding the arena, for the naval combats that the degenerate Romans preferred to Greek drama. Behind the stage the wall they built - of plain red brick instead of the costlier marble of early days - is still two stories high, and four of its granite Corinthian columns, with parts of the architrave, have been re\\u00ebrected to show the decorative scheme. Directly behind are the entrances upon the stage, one at the right, another at the left; and in the center a great ruinous breach in the wall where was once the third or central entrance. On each side are niches which contained statues, and in the side wall at each end of the stage are the vestiaria, the dressing-rooms of the actors. What is left of the auditorium proper - the superstructure added by the Romans is all gone - shows that the seats were divided into nine cunei, sections shaped like wedges; and so perfect were the acoustics that even yet, ruined though the structure is, the slightest word spoken upon the stage is distinctly audible at the very farthest extremity of the upper tier of seats. The way up to the topmost seats is through grass and weeds starred with tiny flowerets, mantling over the scars of Time. Sitting there where Greek and Roman and Saracen in turn have mused before, he is cold indeed who does not thrill to memory and to the marvelous panorama spread below: on the right, tier on tier of the eternal hills in warm brown, their crowns of Saracenic-looking castles lending a militant air to their own stern beauty; below them, a confused medley of roofs and spires, roads and wandering walls, Taormina; through the scena one of the grandest vistas in all creation - \\u00c6tna the giant holding heaven and earth apart, his feet in the mists of the low rolling farmlands, his mighty crest lost amid the clouds of the spring afternoon; and reaching away into infinity, the passionless Ionian Sea of song and story, murmuring a susurrant requiem for the vanished glories of other days. \\n\\n\\nXV THE CITY THAT WAS \\nFrom Taormina to Messina the train hurries along at what seems breakneck speed - through vine and olive yards; past broad shallow, dry fiumi, dusty in summer but heavily walled on both sides against the coming of the winter and spring freshets. Now the hills rise bold and sheer, as we dash into and out of innumerable little smoky tunnels, like a firefly flashing through tangled brush. High on one hillside an old cemetery looks down - an enormous file of dusty old pigeon-holes tossed out from a Titan\\u2019s office and abandoned among the greenery. There comes a town; a queer, quaint, smelly little fishing village - Ali - whose distinct perfume wafts in through even closed windows. Every house in it possesses atmosphere, character, a certain uncouth distinction all its own. Farther on goats - a big herd of them - munch their way along the beach undisturbed by our noisy passing, walking in the cool water up to their fetlocks, eating seaweed and wagging their cronish old heads over the salty feast. What must be the flavor of their milk! But the goats are forgotten as up the Strait from Reggio steams the great car-ferry Scylla, since six miles away along the sweeping curve of the Italian shore to the north, the ugly gaunt rock of Scylla herself crouches against the dun background of iron shore. Scylla and Charybdis, those fabled monsters of early Hellenic legend, apparently had no terrors for the pirates of Kym\\u00e9 who, Thucydides tells us, planted the first nursling settlement of Zankle, later Messina, in one of the most splendid natural locations ever utilized by man - a long, narrow strip of flat shore along the Bay, where the mountains stand well back, and only the foothills come near the water. Before the town shimmers one of the finest harbors in the world, a big circular bay fenced in by a low and sandy strip curved like the sickle the Sicilian Greeks called Danklon or Zankle. The site was a natural emporium at the point where the East and the West meet and are one; an ideal location for a great strategic, commercial and social center. It has always been a notable city. Now we see it in the scarlet page of history as the home of the pirate, the prey of the Carthaginian, the bandit stronghold of the Mamertine, the first glorious conquest of the dashing Norman; then glorying in the wealth the Crusades poured into its lap as the kings of the earth passed by in their search after the impossible and unattainable. Now we hear of it as the prey of a despot, an absentee monarch; now as the favorite of a king who loaded it with privilege; now as the bulwark of all Sicily against incursion from the mainland when Charles of Anjou, after the Vespers, came down upon Messina like Byron\\u2019s Assyrian. Every man became a soldier, every woman in the city - ladies accustomed to ease and luxury as well as their less fortunate sisters - a worker. A song still popular in Sicily runs: Deh com\\u2019 egli \\u00e8 gran pietate delle donne di Messina, veggiendo iscapigliate, portando pietre e calcina! \\u201cOh, what a pity \\u2019tis to see the ladies of Messina carrying stones and chalk!\\u201d One of the things that brought disaster upon Messina was its location upon the line of contact between the primary and secondary formations of \\u00c6tna and Vesuvius, where the shock of earthquake is necessarily the most violent and frequent. And during the last two centuries or so every misfortune that could befall a city has befallen it - siege, bombardment, fire, inundation, cholera, plague, earthquake. Yet through it all, however severe the visitation, the city has been great and undaunted, rising heroically from every catastrophe to begin anew; great in commerce, too, as well as in the heroic spirit of its citizens. Notwithstanding its tragic story, of late years it was a dusty, commercial town, eminently set upon minding its own business and giving little heed during business hours to anything but business. In the evening, however, the whole town was out of doors, gathering in a dense throng to listen to the band concert in the Piazza di Municipio. Grave and reverend seigniors puffing at black Italian cheroots, fat wives on their arms or waddling behind under the weight of their wonderful jewelry; young sparks who wore their hats rakishly and eyed the daughters of families with roguish airs of expert judgment in petticoats; flashy corner loafers whose visages betrayed their character - or lack of it; solemn family parties to whom this open air concert was the diversion of the week; and scores of impish little ragamuffins whose specialty seemed to be vociferous appeals to smokers for cigarette stubs. But the crowd was very Italian, very good-natured, very indolently happy. Dolce far niente ruled, save for the industrious bandsmen, and everybody enjoyed himself in his own way. In the eighteenth century the wide and handsome promenade along the clear waters of the Strait was named La Palazzata, because the stately palazzi of the nobility lined its entire length, and each palace was equal in height, style and construction to all its neighbors. But slowly there crept into the city the sneaking spirit of commercialism. The haughty nobles fell upon evil days and died. Their palaces became shops, hotels, stores; the old glory was fading fast, and the new was a tawdry imitation. The splendor of the Palazzata waned before the vigor of expanding trade that filled the wharves with casks of spoiling lemons for the manufacture of acids and essential oils. The very air of Messina became impregnated, redolent of the pungent essence of fruit turning into gold. But that was not the end. The Palazzata - aye, all Messina - was doomed to fall in the crowning misfortune of the centuries. The terrible earthquake predicted almost to the minute by Mr. Perret of the Vesuvius Observatory, smote the city while it slept, on the morning of December 28, 1908. The earth became a shaken old carpet, ripping, tearing, rending apart hideously, crumpling upon itself. The sea receded and heaped itself in mountains of waters, the beach lay bare. The grim gods of the nether world smiled; they piled the sea and the waves higher into an Olympian bolt, hurled it resistless and foaming upon the helpless town, again to take toll of man\\u2019s rashness. Palace and hotel, shop and church trembled - vacillated - crashed down into agonizing ruin, burying half the city in their d\\u00e9bris. In the city alone 77,283 persons perished. Humanity stood aghast before a catastrophe so tremendous that the intelligence could not grasp its full significance of horror. And when the final relief work was completed, the last reports tabulated, the toll of \\u00c6tna on both sides of the Strait - in Calabria as well as in Sicily - mounted up to two hundred thousand - nearly a quarter of a million lives! Sleeping and praying, weeping and cursing, unconscious and paralyzed with terror, Messina died in the murdering cruelty of the most appalling of all the disasters the heroic city had ever known. The Cathedral, which was begun in 1098 and finished by King Roger, had shared the misfortunes of the city. Earthquake and fire and the still more vandal hand of the restorer had robbed it long before of almost all semblance to the plans of King Roger\\u2019s architects. And the gods of the earth, being no respecters of buildings, hurled it down into ruin like the commonest hut in the city. Not all its massiveness and splendor could save it from the common fate; not all its treasures of goldsmith\\u2019s work and sculpture and art. But though it fell, the people of the dauntless city did not blench. Crushed and dazed as they were, one of the first buildings they put up was a new house of prayer. Hastily knocked together of rough boards, the triumphant symbol of hope and faith nailed firmly above it, that pitiful church spoke dramatically of the spirit that defies defeat and honors victory. The city has arisen anew in a metropolis of more than 65,000 souls, with suitable churches now. Moreover, the commercial spirit of the people asserted itself almost immediately, and exports began with scarcely any delay. In the new Messina that has sprung up - a little to the south and a trifle farther inland - away from the chaos of wrecked buildings and blasted hopes, there is at least a measure of safety. It is largely a wooden city; the buildings are restricted in height, and no fires are permitted expect in the kitchens, which are built of brick. The American relief work is especially interesting to us. No less than 1336 two-room-and-kitchen houses were put up by American hands and with American materials and money in the new Messina, and five hundred more across the Strait in Reggio di Calabria, a total of 1836, capable of housing more than 12,000 people. Each family is bound under pain of expulsion to observe stringent rules for public safety and sanitation, approved by Queen Elena herself. In places these low, white clapboarded cottages, shaded by mulberry trees, have a decidedly New England town appearance. Beside these, American funds built an hotel with seventy-five rooms and thirteen or fourteen baths; a church where some 350 people can worship; two schools that care for eighty children each, and the Elizabeth Griscom Hospital, in which every available resource of modern sanitary engineering in design and construction was employed. White-walled and red-roofed, it stands high on the hillside, a very attractive sight from the Bay, its windows commanding a sweeping view which is a tonic in itself. During the reign of horror that followed the fall of the city, fire and snow, rain and pestilence added their agonies to the already overflowing tragedy. But British and American, Russian and French bluejackets toiled heroically, regardless of personal danger from falling ruins or infection from the stench of thousands of unburied corpses, to help their Italian brethren succor the wounded and rescue the dying. King Victor Emmanuele himself, disregarding comfort and personal safety, hurried to the scene and risked his life in superintending the work of rescue, endearing himself to the Nation by his cool bravery and resourceful tenderness to the sufferers. And not only the King, but Queen Elena, who accompanied him, struggled through the ruins day after day, braving hardships and danger, aiding the wounded and dying with her own hands. All Italy arose and called her blessed. They gave her a new name. She was no longer merely Regina d\\u2019Italia - Queen of Italy - but Regina di Piet\\u00e0 - Queen of Pity. \\n\\n\\nXVI THE NORTHERN SHORE \\nAlong the northern coast from Messina westward to Palermo, almost every foot of the way has some historic interest. High among the precipitous cliffs above the present station of Rometta, the Christians held out against the invading Saracens - who had entered the island in 827 - until 965. Rometta was the last place to fall. A little farther along the rocky shore Sextus Pompey was annihilated by Agrippa in the battle of Naulochus in B. C. 36. Milazzo, sixteen miles from Messina, is the site of ancient Myl\\u00e6, Messina\\u2019s first colony, which had a stirring time of it through all the centuries. The last big event in her history was Garibaldi\\u2019s victory over the Neapolitans, freeing the city from the hated Bourbon rule. The train runs over fiumare after fiumare - riverbeds dry in Summer, rushing torrents in Winter - and vineyards stretch beside the track in vast expanses of low, bushy vines, ripe with promise. Then, with a shriek, the engine drags us in a cindery cloud of smoke through the promontory on which stood Tyndaris, the Greek colony founded by Dionysius I. The town stood nine hundred feet above the black hole into which we plunge. What would be the sensations of this swash-buckling Greek could he see the rock to-day, with the trains, black worms darting through the solid rock he never dreamed of penetrating! More tunnels follow fast, then another cape, and a stretch of glad, open, smiling country that makes one think of the orchards at home. Picturesque towns, groves of oleanders, battered old Roman bridges and medieval castles in which life is still of the Dark Ages, flit by rapidly until Caronia is reached. Here, nearly 2,600 years ago, a Sikel settlement called Kal\\u00e9 Akt\\u00e9 - Beautiful Shore - was made under an ambitious leader named Ducetius, who hoped to save the remnant of his people who were still free in the interior, from absorption by the Greeks. A single defeat, however, crushed this native rising, and all hope of Sikel independence vanished in 444 with the death of Ducetius. \\u201cBeautiful Shore\\u201d withered away until to-day Calacte is a commonplace Sicilian town with even a commonplace name, and only its memories to save it from utter insignificance. And then we come to Cefal\\u00f9, a town whose reputation depends on its dirt, its beggars, and its Cathedral. And there is no excuse for either dirt or mendicants, since it is a thriving commercial and manufacturing city with ample resources to keep itself clean, and purged of begging pests. The name tells its location - Kephal\\u00e9, in Greek, meant head; that is, promontory in this case, and the old Sikel city occupied the crest of the big jutting headland thrusting straight out into the sea and rising over 1,200 feet in height. On this elevation - seventy minutes now of stiff climbing it takes to reach it, over boulders and the detritus of centuries - the Sikels built them a safe city, and swept it about with massive battlemented walls, carried clear down to the sea. Parts of them are still in very good condition; no doubt through the centuries they have been restored again and again. The \\u201cHead\\u201d is bald now - a snowy pate with only a sprinkling of grass - and but one building of uncertain age remains to testify to the different races that have ruled upon this lofty spot. After its acquisition by the Greeks it was important as their western outpost on the northern shore of the island. The one small ruin still standing seems to be that of a Sikel building, of unique structure and great interest. The huge irregular stones in part of it indicate its original appearance, while all about them the decently cut and shaped blocks show an Hellenic restoration. From this height the view is all-embracing - Pellegrino towering above Palermo forty miles to the west; the gaunt black fire peaks of most of the Lipari Islands - once the windy isles of \\u00c6olus - straight out to sea in the northeast; and behind us fertile stretches of rolling country checkered with farms and vineyards; town after town set upon impossible rugged peaks, mountains whose tops tear ragged holes in the mist clouds. In the near distance is the Punto della Caldara, where the shrewd and wily sons of Tyre and Sidon, full of the instinct of commerce, not combat, beached their frail craft and sat down at the feet of the Sikel natives for barter, within easy eyeshot of this eyrie. No doubt from the battlements the natives peered down with less of an eye for the splendid view than for the marketplace of the swarthy, black-bearded Canaanites; and thither they were lured by tempting displays of the royal purple of Tyre, the gold of distant Tarshish far to the west, and the glass and ornaments and statuettes that the Ph\\u0153nician tempters knew how to make and to market so much better than their uncouth selves. As we came down from the desolate heights, it began to rain. Within a few hundred yards of the town we passed the house of an old contadino who sat calmly inside his jute-walled goatpen meditating. In the kitchen door stood his brawny wife, feeding the unkempt, shrewish looking old goat with soup full of green onions from her husband\\u2019s bowl, and diverting herself betimes by lashing the gentle philosopher vigorously, after the fashion of Mrs. Caudle. In 1129 King Roger was returning from the Italian mainland - whither he had gone to whip into docility sundry recalcitrants among his unruly barons - when his vessel was overtaken by a violent storm of the sort that so often lashes the Mediterranean into fury. The King, greatly alarmed, vowed a fine church in honor of the Christ and the Twelve Apostles if he and all his company were permitted to land unharmed. The ship made Cefal\\u00f9 head, and everyone came ashore safely. Two years later King Roger fulfilled his vow, by establishing a town at the foot of the cliff, and beginning to rear the most magnificent sanctuary that had been built in Sicily since the Greeks constructed their massive Doric temples. Tremendous and massive are the only words that fit this building, and the enormous hewn stones upon which the fa\\u00e7ade rests seem to indicate that here must once have stood some ancient fortification which offered the Norman architects a permanent base upon which to build their shrine. The twin spires, the play of the interlacing arches, the round-headed portal - it is especially worthy of notice, by the way - all spell the cool and coherent genius of the northern French architect. Indeed, it is, like King Roger himself, of the Norman brood, but thoroughly adapted to its Sicilian environment. Within, one realizes how royally Roger fulfilled his vow. What miracles were wrought by these hard-living, hard-fighting, hard-worshiping souls who took their religion with such mighty seriousness that it became an integral part of themselves and their daily lives! The main body of the Cathedral is plain white and generally barren. But no pen can describe in detail the blazing mosaics in the tribune without heaping color upon color, design upon design. The colors of the pictures were executed by artists who were almost tone impressionists, so delicate are the soft shades they used to set off the more primitive hues of the borders. From the floor of the chancel the flying ribs of the roof seem sections of delicate enameled work. The farther away one stands the more perfect the illusion becomes, to the point where the designs lose their identity. Indeed, no master jeweler could produce a more harmonious effect with his intricate interweaving of colors and blending of tones. But the crowning wonder of the Cathedral - as in the Cathedral of Monreale and the Cappella Palatina - is the enormous mosaic bust of the Christ which fills the vault of the tribune. Built up like its fellows of the brilliant bits of colored glass that adorn the rest of the apse, it seems a portrait of encrusted gems, a human conception of the Godhead that flashes inspiration from myriad delicate facets. Nevertheless, Cefal\\u00f9 Cathedral fails to impress the beholder as do the other two in which there is not a jarring or inconsistent note from pave to rooftree. Here in Cefal\\u00f9 the bare and dingy plaster walls of the main body - adorned with dubious figures of saints of both sexes, covered with dirt and cobwebs and minus certain of their limbs - make a contrast so glaring as to strike dismay to the most appreciative spirit. Old as the Cathedral is, the beach at Cefal\\u00f9 is strewn with curious craft that seem even more ancient: queer old feluccas, cask-like smacks with barrel bows and truncated sterns swept by huge tillers, bottle-nosed xebecs with staring painted eyes for hawse-holes and central sideboards in lieu of keels. And nowhere else in the island are the different types of the forefathers more numerous and distinct: here a distinctly Semitic type, with the swart face, black beard and piercing eyes of the Ph\\u0153nicians; here a pure Greek face worthy of the sculptor; there a burnt-up son of the desert, and yonder a Roman beside a Gaul. Busy and prosperous they seem, for all their dirt and indifference to squalor and evil smells; and moreover, contented. Their fishing smacks bring in tons of herring which by euphemy go out of Cefal\\u00f9 in cans of oil as the best sardines. The chief industries of the town, after the selling of clothes and notions, seemed to be the manufacture and sale of cheap perfumes and footgear, so far as I could see. From Cefal\\u00f9 westward the railway runs beside acres upon acres of artichokes and whole fields of crimson sumac, while the \\u201cdonkey ears\\u201d of the prickly pear form spiky hedges and great pin cushions everywhere. For these are the Campi Felici, the Happy Fields of Fertility, whose fruitful farms give back rich returns for the labor spent upon them, and which murmur always with the creaking music of huge wooden wheels over which run the endless strings of irrigating buckets introduced ages ago by the Arabs. Another of their importations is manna. On the slopes of Angels\\u2019 Peak - otherwise Gibilmanna, or Manna Mountain - these trees still grow, as they did in Africa and Araby, and the people gather considerable quantities of their exudations of gum. Ten miles down the line we come to the site of Himera. Here two of the greatest events in Greek history transpired, battles both, one a glorious victory, the other a frightful defeat and disaster. The good tyrant Theron of Akragas secured his vast number of able-bodied slaves here after the first battle, when in 480 B. C., with his son-in-law, the tyrant Gelon of Syracuse, he defeated the Carthaginians. It is said that Hamilcar himself took no part in the battle, but that all day he stood alone on a hilltop overlooking the fight, watching the Greeks driving back his picked troops. All day he prayed and sacrificed in vain, and at evening, his own army little more than a disorganized rabble streaming pellmell across the field, he threw himself into the altar fire as a supreme sacrifice to the bloody gods of Carthage. When Hamilcar\\u2019s grandson, Hannibal Gisgon, was sent over in another campaign against the Sicilian Greeks - this warfare was practically continuous - he wasted no time - though he destroyed Selinus by the way - but hurried to Himera, urged on by the spirit of filial vengeance. Baal and Ashtaroth were more gracious to him than they had been to his grandfather, and he wiped Himera from the map, literally leaving not one stone upon another in the fated city. At the end of the day he made his sacrifice to the gods - three thousand of the men of Himera, all who were left alive after the battle, on the very spot where the Shophet Hamilcar seventy-one years before had offered up himself. What is the relation between street cries and criers? Do certain words or names necessarily draw to themselves vendors whose characters can be influenced by the sounds they utter in selling their wares; or do natures of a given sort instinctively select only those things whose names have a corresponding spirit to their own? Some Max Mueller can perhaps answer the question; but anyone can observe the facts. They apply especially to newsboys in the Latin countries. Passing Termini again - the hot springs of Himera - the papers were just out, and the voice of the little fellow at the window of the compartment with copies of The Hour was a long, musical drawl - \\u201cL\\u2019 Oh-oh-oh-oh - raaaa! L\\u2019 Oh-oh-oh-oh - raaa...!\\u201d Very different from this cry was that of the lad selling Life. He cried in a sharp staccato recitative, repeating very rapidly: \\u201cLa Vita-Vita-Vita-Vit\\u2019-Vit\\u2019-Vit\\u2019!\\u201d Most lackadaisical of all was the older boy who had Sicilia. From scarcely opened lips and with dreamy eyes, he slowly intoned each syllable of the name, extending and amplifying and sweetening it, as a tender morsel of which he could not get enough, softening his c\\u2019s and making his l\\u2019s most liquid and mellifluous - \\u201cSeee-sheeeeee-lll-ly-aaaaah!\\u201d About the time that the Ph\\u0153nicians founded Panormos, their greatest city, in the bosom of the rich plain at the water\\u2019s edge, they also founded another city upon the crest of a lofty rock at the other side of the bay, and called it Solous, probably from the Hebrew or Ph\\u0153nician word sela, meaning rock. It was a border fortress, a watch tower from which the Semitic traders could keep an eye on the ever encroaching Greeks. But when the heyday of Ph\\u0153nician power was fading, the Soluntines invited the conquering Romans in, so the meager ruins to be seen are not the wreck of Ph\\u0153nician Solous, but of the Roman Soluntum in which its identity was swallowed up. No greater contrast can be imagined than that which exists between these two cities - Palermo living, Solunto dead beyond any power to infuse life into its stony veins. There are three ways to reach Solunto - that is its modern Italian name - by express train to the station for Bagheria; by accommodation to Santa Flavia, which is within five minutes\\u2019 walk of the Antichit\\u00e0 di Solunto; or by carriage from Palermo, a ten- or twelve-mile drive each way. Luncheon should be taken. If you enjoy a lively time, by all means go by express to Bagheria on a festa or feast-day. As you step from the station platform you are immediately the center of a howling mob of peasants and hackmen, all behaving like enraged lunatics and grabbing at you from every side. When this happened to me, I called into play all the football tactics I had ever learned, charged through the thickest of the mass, and pelted down the road in exceedingly undignified fashion, the whole pack yelling derisively at my heels. As I trudged ahead, I heard the squeak of ungreased wheels, and was hailed by the driver of a skeleton stage capable of holding four uncomfortably - five were already in it. \\u201cHai - get in and ride!\\u201d he called cheerily. \\u201cWhere are you going?\\u201d \\u201cTo Bagheria. I like walking!\\u201d The driver laughed; so did his inconsiderate fares. \\u201cIt is a very long walk by this road to Bagheria - all the way around Sicily!\\u201d I stopped walking. He went on: \\u201cBut if you want to go to Solunto, I\\u2019ll take you there for three lire. You can walk to Bagheria from there.\\u201d \\u201cBut your stage is too full now,\\u201d I objected. \\u201cNever! Plenty of room. Come - I\\u2019ll take you for two lire, if you can\\u2019t afford to pay me three.\\u201d Crowding uncomfortably together, the other occupants, decent young peasants, made room for me, and we creaked slowly on behind the half-starved horse whose best pace was a walk. Here a huge brown villa of the soap-box type deflected the road to one side; there fresh young vegetables sprouted thickly from clay pits which had all the seeming of prehistoric stone ruins; yonder a meadow full of drying brick and loose straw proclaimed the brickmaker at work. Turning and twisting, the road wandered on leisurely until we neared the Antichit\\u00e0 di Solunto, the rest house where visitors may stop to eat luncheon and buy the sour red wine the custodian has for sale. A sudden ominous sagging of the rear of the stage made everyone seize something. But a cheery voice reassured us, and Gualterio\\u2019s beaming face peered in over the tailboard. \\u201cI am here, signore!\\u201d he cried delightedly. \\u201cBehold, if you need me.\\u201d I crawled out with some difficulty while everybody laughed but the driver, who was demanding four lire instead of two. Promptly Gualterio took command of the situation. \\u201cYou go on - I will pay him!\\u201d and he turned on the fellow with a fervid exposition of his complete ancestry of thieves and jailbirds, threw him two lire, and started him off again. The road up the hill to Solunto is magnificently paved even yet with the great irregular smooth blocks the Romans put to such excellent purpose on their military highways, curving to take advantage of every angle in the abrupt hillside, winding among thickets of prickly pear, and past little irrigation ducts among lemon groves which murmur with a susurrant echo of the little channels that flow down Granada\\u2019s long slope. Neatly piled beside the upper reaches of the road on either hand are dismembered columns, statues, fragments of pilasters, cornices, and blocks of marble. The ruins of the city itself are unsatisfying and meager - a single wide street lined with the foundations of some buildings of undiscernible age, half a dozen streets, similarly desolated, crossing it at almost right angles, a single three-cornered structure set up by an arch\\u00e6ologist and called, for want of a better title, the Gymnasium, and here and there some bit of mosaic pavement or wall decoration. Indeed, no one knew the exact site of Soluntum, which vanished ages ago, until in 1825 a peasant scratching about on the hillside unearthed splendid marble candelabra whose richness indicated their Roman origin, and small statues of Jupiter and Isis. Soluntum was found, and the arch\\u00e6ologists proceeded to uncover it. It reminds one strongly of Pompeii, though much less of interest has been discovered in it. But Solunto has a view, a transcendent panorama before which even a fountain pen falters. At the foot of the hill, Gualterio - he had come out from Palermo for the festa - put me into a passing jaunting car and sent me on my way to the villas of Bagheria, the most interesting of which is the property of Prince Palagonia. On either side of the gate are two queer old gnomes mounted upon marble pedestals and dressed in fantastic adaptations of Saracenic costume; the head gardener\\u2019s wife assured me that these trolls are so terrible they frighten away not only trespassers, but \\u201cany other evil spirit\\u201d who dares to come that way. She crossed herself devoutly when she mentioned the names of certain malicious spirits who, she said, would be only too glad to molest Bagheria but for the forethought of the Prince. The hollow wall about the rather ragged garden is wide enough in places to be used as dwellings for the servants. Courageous indeed must they be to rest under the shapes that decorate the wall, as weird a collection of zoological nightmares as ever were carved in stone by an insane sculptor at the hest of an insane patron. Black with age and the weather, grotesque pipers, trolls, knights, gentlemen, ladies, elves, monkeys, dragons, hunchbacks, cats, roosters, things intended to be representations of evil spirits, a miscellaneous scattering of angels and cherubs, a virgin or two, and the Prince\\u2019s patron saint, stand, jump, walk, fly, or poise on one foot. A heavy wind had played havoc with some of the figures a few days before my visit. \\u201cEcc\\u2019!\\u201d exclaimed the gardener\\u2019s wife, pointing ahead. On the wall a most pious madonna, her hands crossed over her faded blue breast, gazed sadly down upon a dancer standing upon her head and buried almost to her shoulders in the mucky earth. How horrified the staid Virgin must have been when the worldling flew down the wind and poised upside down! \\u201cFrightful, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d asked my guide. \\u201cOh, spaventosa! When are you going to put her back on the wall?\\u201d I inquired. She shook her head sadly. \\u201cI do not know. Maybe never. The Prince is not rich enough now to bother about raising fallen ladies!\\u201d There are other unoccupied villas in Bagheria of the same kind, with the same sort of \\u201cdevil-scarers,\\u201d but I preferred the live performers to the dead ones - the festa waited. \\u2018Festa di San Giu,\\u2019 the natives called it; but the railroad announcements in the stations stated that it was a town fair in honor of San Giuseppe. Bagheria itself is not a particularly attractive town, though clean and well-kept, and its nineteen or twenty thousand inhabitants do their best to decorate themselves and their buildings in honor of the saint, while thousands of merrymakers flock in from Palermo and all the country round. At one side of the Corso two workmen were nailing pinwheels, serpents, set pieces and other explosives to a set of frames for a castello di fuoco (fire-castle), at the same time puffing on long, thin Italian cigars. As I came along, one of the men knocked the ashes of cigar upon a pile of small saucissions, and nodded a cheerful greeting. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d he called, as I sprang back. \\u201cDid something bite you?\\u201d \\u201cNo,\\u201d I replied, steadily walking backward. \\u201cBut aren\\u2019t those fireworks?\\u201d \\u201cCertainly!\\u201d Stalls with cakes, sweet bread-sticks, candies, preserved watermelon seeds, nuts, fruit of various sorts, and indigestion-breeding pastry filled the streets. Around them the people flocked in their wonderful Sunday clothes. Others, gray-headed and sedate, sat in couples on the curbs, the men, generally fat, tinkling on ridiculously tiny mandolins, while their wives sang, and the crowds in the caf\\u00e9s and on the sidewalks clapped time or danced with feet, hands and heads, though all the while sitting still. One wineshop, little more than a cellar, had twelve heaps of not overly clean straw spread upon the damp stones. \\u201cDoes the illustrious foreign Signore require a bed?\\u201d asked the proprietor with a grinning bow. \\u201cMost cheap, sir, and excellent, only two soldi - for all night. Eleven are already taken. Behold the property!\\u201d and he pointed to various lumpy bundles of clothes, and large bandanna handkerchiefs tied at the corners, undoubtedly containing food. The owners of these bundles had made sure of their beds by stuffing their property into the straw. Thanking the genial Boniface, I declined his invitation and passed on. At San Giuseppe the people, with cheery indifference, had turned the yard of the house of prayer into a den of thieves. Gambling of every sort known to the Sicilian peasantry was going on, and two games were running full blast, one on each side of the main entrance. There were the familiar p\\u2019tits ch\\u2019vaux; lotto on a black rubber sheet bearing numbers; the old familiar shell game, and a sort of crude roulette. Surrounding these stalls, of which there were nineteen on the sloping piazza between the church and the street, were hundreds of boys and young men, mostly lads of ten to twelve years. Their average play was one soldo or penny, the minimum bet half a soldo, and the high four soldi. The fa\\u00e7ade of the church was covered with hundreds of oil-cups in rows. Inside, the whitewashed walls were hung, for the nonce, with a bewildering jumble of strips of gaudy colored cloth, pendant from the gallery, fringed and criss-crossed with gold lines like cheap wall paper. The image of San Giu\\u2019 (Saint Joseph), mounted upon a large float, waited at one side of the nave ready to go out on the men\\u2019s shoulders just at dusk for the procession, and around it stood eighteen candles, some of them six inches in diameter and no less than six feet in height. On the front of the float hung votive offerings, paintings in smudgy oils on cardboard, one showing the death of Benedetto Giuseppe, at the hand of an assassin. Children with carts and poles and rubber balls played about while old men and women knelt praying on the stone floor, and young girls strolled about in giggling pairs. Four hundred or more guttering candles filled the church with smoke and falling flakes of soot, and \\u201call the world\\u201d eddied in and out comfortably and contentedly, unawed by their church or their saint, making a comrade of holy Giuseppe and at peace with the whole of Creation, including even the foreign interloper with the camera, who sat to one side and watched as they made merry. \\n\\n\\nXVII THE WESTERN SHORE \\nGoing westward from Palermo, the railroad cuts inland behind Monte Pellegrino, crossing the Conca d\\u2019Oro past many villas, and does not again touch the coast until, ten miles away, it reaches Sferracavallo, whose main street is so atrociously paved as to give the town its merited name - Unshoe-a-Horse. The line then skirts the shore for some distance, and the early morning scenes on the water to the right are more than lovely. Fishermen flit about in their white-winged boats or toil at launching the heavy craft. The waterfront of every village is a hive of industry. One picturesque and striking scene after another flits by until, at the end of an hour or so, we come out at Cinisi-Terrasini on the shores of the Gulf of Castellammare, a tremendous, sparkling expanse belted in by a fillet of gleaming white sand. From the bay, orchards and grain fields roll upward to the hills that pyramid, one upon another, into mountains dim and blue in the misty distance. At Partinico we desert the shore and sweep in a ragged loop inland to pause a moment at the town - it has a far reaching trade in oil and wine - before darting back shoreward again, unable to resist the fascination of Father Neptune. Close to the water\\u2019s edge another town, Balestrate, sprawls along shore among the dunes, over which grows a savage luxuriance of reeds and grasses, among which, on an occasional acre, wrested from barrenness, is a hut of thatch and a hardy family of hard working peasants. Can these be the descendants of the Sikans and Sikels who so long ago vanished from the earth; and are these huts anything like the primitive dwellings in which those still more primitive folk loved and bred and died? Certainly except for using iron tools and smoking tobacco, they seem to have little advantage over their progenitors. Paying back-breaking taxes and furnishing conscripts to-day is almost as bad as being at the mercy of a Greek tyrant with his demands for money and men. At the head of the bay, three miles before the railroad reaches the town of Castellammare, once the seaport of Elymian Segesta, it turns southward, and ascends the valley of the Fiume San Bartolommeo. Its principal tributary is the Fiume Freddo (Cold Stream), once the Krimisos, near which a wonderful battle was fought between the Carthaginians, and the Greeks under Timoleon the Deliverer. So alarmed was Carthage by his prowess and activity that for the first time the Sacred Band, the picked Home Guard, was sent over to Sicily. Near the Krimisos, Timoleon, undaunted by the desperate odds, hurled his eleven thousand Greeks against the 70,000 barbarians. Just before the conflict the Greeks met a mule train laden with selinon, or wild celery, the plant used at funerals. What omen could have been worse? Panic hovered in the air. But Timoleon\\u2019s wit was quick and sure. Gayly he made a wreath of the plant and crowned himself, with the remark that it was the crown used at the Isthmian Games. With a shout of relief officers and men followed his example, and confidence mounted high as the host marched on. In the battle that followed, the very gods of Hellas fought for the Deliverer, Zeus the Thunderer darkening the heavens and hurling his fiery bolts. Rain and hail quenched the ardor of the Carthaginians; the thunder deafened and the lightning blinded them - the whole storm drove straight in their faces. And the Greeks, marching forward steadily under the divine \\u00e6gis, cut the Punic host to pieces, annihilated the Sacred Band. History repeated itself May 15, 1860, when, on the hills of Calatafimi, again a deliverer of the people, this time Giuseppe Garibaldi, crushed a foreign enemy and oppressor. Many an army had marched and camped and fought among these hills and vales, and the powdery dust of the milk-white roads had puffed up from the feet of Elymian and Ph\\u0153nician, Greek and Roman legions. But never before had a victory meant so much to civilization as the success of the badly armed but desperately determined and immortal Thousand who followed the gray-haired sailor-hero. And history repeated itself yet again when Garibaldi, like Timoleon, refused everything for himself, counting it honor enough to serve Sicily so well. While it is possible to drive from Castellammare to all the points of interest in the vicinity, and they are many, it is better to go on by the train to the station Alcamo-Calatafimi. Neither town is near the railway station, but either diligenzia or carriage is to be had for the ride - four miles to Alcamo, an old Saracenic town which still keeps a certain oriental tang, or about six miles in the other direction to Calatafimi. Almost straight north, along the high-road to Castellammare, are the ruins of Segesta, a spot full of tragic memories. Segesta - Egesta it was then - one of the two great Elymian cities, trafficked with Carthage, with Sicilian Greeks, with Athens, with anyone, in a word, as suited her purpose at the moment; but somehow she usually came to grief through these very alliances. Indeed, it was her continual bickering with Greek Selinus, her distant neighbor on the southern shore, that first brought the meddling Athenians to Sicily, and so indirectly caused the great war between Athens and Syracuse. To-day there is not an Elymian ruin left in the city; all that remains of the ill-starred metropolis is Greek and Roman. The superb temple, alike a monument to Greek genius and the devotion of the people, rises from a lofty plateau - a glowing golden shrine upon an altar all of green, embayed by watchful, hoary mountains. Only the massiveness of a Doric structure could so perfectly chime in with the grandeur of Nature, so fittingly command the immense and silent though turbulent landscape that rolls away from its feet. Revelation inspired its location, and genius erected it - to stand lovelier and more marvelous still after the lapse of ages than when there was a city near by to detract from its majestic solitude. The Greeks, with their unerring artistic sense, always built their theaters in positions commanding magnificent views, and the little theater here at Segesta, though only about half the size of the one at Syracuse, looks out upon the sea, many miles away, and a magnificent panorama of hills and forests on either side. Of the town only a few very scanty bits of ruined houses have been uncovered. One of the most lurid episodes in the city\\u2019s history occurred when the tyrant Agathocles - he feigned to be a merry soul, though really a butcher at heart, with massacre as his chief diversion! - tortured and slaughtered ten thousand of the inhabitants, sold all the likely looking boys and girls as slaves, repeopled the city with colonists of his own, and called it Dikaiopolis, the City of Righteousness! Indeed, Agathocles was in many respects the most picturesque despot Sicily ever produced, and his career reads like a modern romantic novel. Born a potter, he entered the army, was banished, recalled to Syracuse, married a wealthy widow there, frustrated plot after plot against his life, engaged in wholesale murders, established himself as a full fledged tyrant, and made war against Carthage in her own territory - the first time the arrogant daughter of Ph\\u0153nicia had ever been tracked to her lair by an enemy. Raising himself by treachery and massacre upon a throne of his enemies\\u2019 skulls, Agathocles made himself master of all Sicily, and for seventeen years more held his power intact, butcher and trickster to the end, yet somehow managing always to retain the good will of the masses. From Calatafimi the train goes on southward past ancient Halicy\\u00e6, a big town arrogantly perched upon a height, gemmed with a castle, to Castelvetrano, where we leave it for the ruins of Selinus on the shore, seven miles away. The trip is made either by carriage or on horseback, as you may prefer. The acropolis, the pulsing heart of Selinus, is an empty shell. Beneath our feet the historic pave over which rumbled the springless chariots of Ph\\u0153nician and Greek, lies buried in crumbling d\\u00e9bris; the fallen temples, the vast hillocks of ruin beyond, tell mutely how great and how glorious must the city have been before Hannibal the destroyer poured forth his savage wrath upon it; and in street and plain the selinon, or wild celery, which named the city, still thrusts upward to the same sun that warmed the early settlers. On the hill east of the acropolis rise the ruins of the three largest temples, colossal structures, but not a fragment of any other kind. These stupendous edifices, even in their desolation, are among the most inspiring of Sicilian monuments; especially when we remember that at no time was the city first or even second among the Greek communities. And from these temples of Selinus were taken the wonderful metopes - now in the Palermo Museum - that so graphically illustrate the progress of Greek-Sicilian temple sculpture. Here on the eastern hill the Selinutines were busy raising to Ph\\u0153bus Apollo his greatest fane when the invader came, and, dropping their tools, the workmen hastened to their doom. The structure was 371 feet long, 177 wide - so tremendous that upon its base were erected forty-six giant columns, almost fifty-eight feet high and twelve feet thick! It seems almost impossible that so vast, so tremendously solid a structure should collapse like an eggshell; and yet the seismic shock that evidently destroyed it tossed those huge walls and columns lightly aside, voiding at a single stroke the work of the builders who planned like genii and executed like Titans. How was it, we wonder, that Selinus offended the mighty earth gods as well as the god of war? And how long was it before they shook the earth to its very vitals and completed the work of destruction the barbarian had begun? That the Carthaginians cut off the temple builders at their work is proven by a visit to the quarries, some distance inland. From the necropolis, west of the river, the road winds in, and before the quarries are reached we pass block after block of the shaped stones abandoned in transport to the temples. In the great pits themselves one may look on, almost as if time had been annihilated, at the various stages of the work - there are some huge blocks from eight to ten feet long and eight feet thick, corresponding exactly with the column drums of the temple marked G on the plans for the use of visitors, and without doubt intended for that edifice. It is an object lesson one cannot soon forget, of the blighting breath of war, a tragedy without words that is inexpressibly moving. To the southwest of Selinus is the Punta di Granitola, where the Arabs landed in 827 A. D., Koran in one hand, sword in the other - the last African invaders to conquer the island, let us hope. Farther along, on both shore and railroad, is Mazzara, with a Norman cathedral and ruined castle; and straight northwest on a little promontory of its own is Marsala, better known for its sweet, rich wine than as the modern successor of Carthaginian Lilybaion. Though Marsala - the name is Arabic: Marsa Ali, Ali\\u2019s Harbor - was never possessed by the Greeks, its story is nevertheless vivid and varied. As the chief stronghold of Carthage, it played a vital part in the struggle for supremacy in this \\u201cbarbarian corner\\u201d of the island. Pyrrhus besieged it in vain, and thirty years later Rome besieged it unsuccessfully for eight years in one of the most stubborn and remarkable campaigns in history. Afterward, during the Roman period, the city was known as \\u201cthe most splendid,\\u201d and was made the capital of the western half of Sicily, Syracuse being the eastern capital. It became an important dockyard and naval station, whence the Roman campaigns against Africa were dispatched. Don John of Austria, too, sailed hence on his expeditions against the Turks. It was into the harbor of Marsala on that memorable 11th of May, 1860, that the two little steamers Lombardo and Piemonte, which the revolutionists had shanghaied from the Rubattino Company up at Genoa the week before, sneaked to land Garibaldi and his red-shirt brigade. They got ashore safely, in spite of the Bourbons\\u2019 cruisers, and before they left for Calatafimi Garibaldi posted his now famous proclamation claiming Sicily for King Victor Emmanuele. Of course there are a cathedral, Punic and Christian tombs, the remains of ancient walls and harbor works, latomie and so on, but to-day Marsala really spells only - Wine! The largest and most important establishments are those of the Englishmen Ingham and Woodhouse, and the Sicilian Florio of Palermo. But there are numerous others not so well known nor doing so large a business. The long, low, white bodegas are open to the inspection of visitors, and to those who have never seen them, the processes of blending and converting with the use of the \\u201cmother\\u201d wines, the mechanical bottling and corking, the labeling and packing departments, the endless rows of hogsheads and the strongly vinous atmosphere, all possess an attraction peculiarly their own. There is something of interest in every foot of each establishment. But - verbum sap! Beware the atmosphere, and the testing to which you are invited. In all the great wine-making countries it is considered a legitimate joke to befuddle the careless American whose enthusiasm outruns his prudence. One or two sips of the wine may be taken with dignity, but Marsala, like its Spanish cousin, Sherry, is a heady wine, and the rich, heavy air of the winery and wareroom alike bespeak caution on the part of the investigator, if a delightful memory is not to be spoiled by a pricking conscience. Around the old harbor to the north of Marsala are extensive salt works, and between it and Trapani are about forty-five more, all worked by private capital, since Italy\\u2019s royal monopoly has not been extended to Sicily. Salt is one of the island\\u2019s most valuable exports, and the salt-pans down by the sea, at Trapani - the ancient Drepana of Carthaginian days - have made the city the most prosperous place, for its size, in the island. From a distance the heaps look as if an army of invading Saracens had pitched their tents upon the flats, and quaint windmills add a distinctly Dutch note to the scene. The heavy brine is pumped up into shallow excavations or \\u201cpans,\\u201d as the tanks are called. The hot Sicilian sunshine and the warm African breezes do the rest. When the water has evaporated, the pans are thickly coated with the crystals, which workmen shovel into glittering heaps and cover with tiles to protect them. There the salt waits, for either the refinery or for shipment in bulk as a crude product. Trapani itself is one of the cleanest towns in the island, as well as one of the most prosperous, and of course has its Via Garibaldi, which proves its fraternity with all other Sicilian cities. While there is nothing really great in it, in either architecture or art, the city is nevertheless full of minor interest, and various objects of art ranging all the way from pieces of the Middle Ages down to the present day statues of King Victor Emmanuele II and Garibaldi, neither of which is yet forty years old. One could while away many a pleasant day loitering among these things - the Cathedral, with its Crucifixion by Van Dyck, and splendid old carven seats in the choir; the quaint decorations of Sant\\u2019 Agostino, where the Knights Templars worshiped centuries ago; Lucca della Robbia\\u2019s marble-framed Madonna in the other church of Santa Maria di Ges\\u00f9; the seventeenth century polychrome wooden statues by Trapani\\u2019s own sons in the Oratory of San Michele; the queer tower of the Spedadello down in the Ghetto, and so on. Equally pleasant it is to wander along the tree-shaded promenade at the water\\u2019s edge, or as far out as the Torre di Ligny, on the very tip of the \\u201csickle\\u201d (drepana) that Trapani thrusts out into the sea. Off shore, the picturesque \\u00c6gadian Isles rise like jewels from the sea. From the middle of the eighteenth to the last quarter of the nineteenth century they were owned by the noble Pallavicini family of Genoa. They are still private property, since in 1874 Signor Florio of Palermo, the steamship man and wine grower, added them to his multifarious interests and made them the headquarters of the most important tunny fishery in Sicily. Trapani possesses the usual historical interest of intermittent conflict between the races that struggled for the possession of the island, but its legendary story is even more gripping. Virgil pictures the founding of the city by the hero \\u00c6neas and his Trojans after Troy had fallen, the death of the venerable Anchises, and the festival \\u00c6neas instituted in honor of his father\\u2019s uneasy spirit. The poet\\u2019s soaring imagination carried the hero on up the mist-shrouded mountain behind, to worship at the fane of his mother Venus. This cloudy peak was named after Eryx - son of Butes, the mighty wrestler - who challenged Hercules to a test of strength, and was vanquished by that worthy robber, who stopped while driving off Geryon\\u2019s stolen herds long enough to win the match and take the mountain as his prize. With the beginning of history it appears in the possession of the Elymians, who claimed to be descendants of the Trojans. Twenty-five hundred feet in the air rises Eryx, to-day Monte San Giuliano, reached from Trapani by an interminably winding but easy road that twists and turns half a hundred times in its ascent. Up through the purple shadows of gulches, along the sharp edges of startling acclivities winds the trail, with halcyone fields of every brilliant flower and plant below, and great expanses waving with grain, green and gold with lemons and oranges, red with the fresh wounds of the plow. Hide-sandaled and heavily caped and hooded peasants, shepherds who seem to have stepped right out of Odyssey or \\u00c6neid, carrying classic water or wine flasks, greet us cheerily along the way. As we near the top the reason for these heavy garments becomes apparent in the lower temperature, for Eryx is a peak and a city of fog, often a little world by itself far above the earth, unseen by and unseeing city and plain below, looking down only on the tufted white of rolling mists. Cyclopean fragments of ancient walls and natural precipices blend into one another and into the present town walls, above steep approaches to the Gates of Trapani, of the Heralds, and of the Sword, the three entrances to all that exists of Eryx to-day, where less than three thousand souls live in that part of the town nearest the ruins of the temple, whose very altars long since crumbled into the dust of oblivion. In the days when the Elymians were its masters, the mountain was sacred to a goddess who evidently had the same functions as the Roman Venus. What her Elymian name was we do not know; but since the Ph\\u0153nicians called her Astarte, the Greeks Aphrodite and the Romans Venus, one after the other, we may feel sure that whatever her original name, she stood, as did those later goddesses identified with her, for love and beauty and sustenance. And though centuries have passed, and the altar before her whereon no blood was permitted to be spilt no longer bears the fire of sacrifice, the priestly ideal of woman still presides over this sacred rock so high among the mists. For here where the pagans worshiped their unknown goddess, to-day the Virgin gazes down upon the unchanging sacrifice of years, the hearts of men. The town is rugged and irregular and personal to a degree that captivates the most hardened sightseer - crooked, narrow streets, full of quaint buildings rich in Eastern touches: here a latticed casement suggesting veiled women and mystery, yonder ajimez windows divided by delicate little columns, farther along an harmonious blending of the Norman and Moorish on sculptured pillar capital and gallery. The people are as captivating as the town - caped men stalking to and fro like comic opera brigands, women whose loveliness has made Eryx noted. Foliage so rich and varied that only a catalogue can describe it riots in the garden once part of the temple precincts, and sprouts between the stones of the ancient, partly ruined castle that legend would have us believe was erected by no less a personage than D\\u00e6dalus himself. To-day the castle is partly used as a prison, and it is a warden who admits to the quiet precincts. Crumbling bastion and curtain, roofless hall and moldy dungeon keep, silent corridor and deserted rampart, where no Elymian spears now glisten in the occasional sunshine or drip gloomily with the characteristic golden fog, weave a powerful spell, so powerful, so enchanting none would be surprised in the slightest did the castle suddenly galvanize into life, and the figure of the lovely goddess of eld once more smile in the little temple whose foundations only now exist. It is a city, a castle, a location only to be sketched. No colors, no details can at all conjure forth the charm at once so definite and so elusive. See Eryx! - even if you have no \\u00e6roplane and must either \\u201cride or walk\\u201d - a guidebook solemnly advises this as the best way to reach the summit - up that splendid road into the very skies. \\n\\n\\nXVIII ADDIO, SICILIA! \\nIn Sicily all roads lead to Palermo. And if they do not, you manage to make them. And no matter how many times you return to that city of splendid light, you always find that there is some pleasant or interesting or profitable trip out from the city that you have missed before: perhaps to the picturesque Albanian colony of Piana dei Greci; or up in the hills to the suppressed Benedictine monastery of San Martino, founded by Gregory the Great in the sixth century; or to the village of Acquasanta near by for the sea-bathing; or even to the convict island of Ustica, about five hours away, whose population was killed or carried off by pirates as recently as the middle of the eighteenth century; and always - unless you have spent a year straight through in the city, - you will find some new festival to gladden your eyes and deafen your ears. It may be that after a tiresome day your matutinal slumbers are rudely disturbed by a weird clamor in the street long before getting-up time. Growlfully you turn over and try to sleep again. The racket goes right on, with darting insistence, and by and by you grow interested enough to ring for a maid and ask why in the name of Morfeo the concierge doesn\\u2019t go out and put on the soft pedal if he can\\u2019t entirely stop the bedlam! \\u201cWhy, signori!\\u201d cries the girl, astonished at ignorance of so important an event. \\u201cIt is the Festa della Madonna dei Capri - the Feast of Our Lady of the Goats. We have it every single year. Everybody is out!\\u201d It sounds that way! There is no use in trying to sleep, so you get up wrathfully and open the shutters. Along the dusty way in solemn processions march conscious-looking cows, wreathed and garlanded with flowers. Now and then a stately bossy ambles by, wearing a three-foot horseshoe of red and white roses, rising above her horns like a halo, and exhaling, if not the odor of sanctity, at least right sweet odors withal. Other cows have about their necks painted wooden poke-collars surmounted by floral horseshoes, or wear simply strings of flowers; and behind nearly every cow tags her mournful looking baby. The goats, fairly strutting with pride, however, are the most ludicrous members of these amazing cavalcades, for they have bouquets attached with wire and toothpicks to twisted horns and even to their sub-tails, which wig-wag signals as they bob along with arched necks. Occasionally a lone lamb, waddling toilsomely behind everything else, bleats its disgust and weariness, its immaculate wool tied full of flaring crimson or blue ribbon crosses, its tail banded with ribbons in a network until it looks like the foot and ankle of a dancing girl. Before them all march the \\u201cbands,\\u201d scratch organizations of amateur players who discourse painfully upon all manner of instruments, wind, string and brass. The fortunate morning we saw this unique festa pasturale, I really wanted to make pictures, but mindful of my chilly sunrise experience in Taormina, neither blare of bands nor tinkle of bells could move me until after breakfast. Then, alas! the decorated animals had all passed by, and I had to be content with a plain, motherly cow, whose baby - tied to mother\\u2019s tail! - managed to get a few pints of breakfast as the crowd posed. I made the picture-taking as slow as possible, to give the poor little calf five minutes for refreshments. No one who has ever seen the pastures in and near Palermo wonders at the poor beasts\\u2019 melancholy air of appetite. You find some of these grazing fields on the slopes of Monte Pellegrino when you go toilsomely up to visit the shrine of the city\\u2019s virgin saint, Rosalia. The little Mount of the Pilgrim has not always borne that name; only since the great plague of 1624, in fact. Before that, for ages, it was Herkte, or Heircte. Square-faced and rugged, it rises in a sheer precipice from the waves on one side, an isolated limestone crag, and slopes less abruptly down to the Conca d\\u2019Oro on the other. In 248 B. C., Hamilcar the Carthaginian, who camped up on Herkte to keep in check the Romans in Palermo, cleared and planted fields with grain to feed his hungry troops. There are still scanty cultivated fields on the mountain, and though now, from a little distance, Pellegrino seems even balder than it is, large herds of cattle manage by hard work to crop a meager living from its insignificant grass and herbage. Visiting Pellegrino\\u2019s upper slopes and the little chapel in the grotto of Sta. Rosalia is as much a part of seeing Palermo as the visit to the Colosseum is a part of seeing Rome. But it is not quite so easy as some of the other little journeys about Palermo, since the steep ascent cannot be negotiated by carriage. Either on four feet or on two the trip must be made - most people make it on four. Tumultuous donkeyboys lie in wait in the Piazza, Falde at the foot of the mountain, and \\u201cbark\\u201d the merits of their beasts with a vigor that is sometimes confusing, while the donkeys themselves - mere burros they are, tiny but powerful - gaze at their burdens-to-be with a droll air of resignation. Most of the saddles are medieval housings built of boards, over which odds and ends of coarse carpet have been nailed until they look like Joseph\\u2019s famous coat. Lucky visitors, or those who start early enough after either breakfast or luncheon to have room for choice, pick the more commonplace and comfortable leather saddles that decorate two or three of the newer donkeys. Otherwise, eating from the mantelpiece for a day or so afterward is almost a necessity! The road up the hill is a splendid piece of engineering as well as a picturesque and romantic highway. Who but Latins would construct at vast expense a road like this simply for the ease and comfort of pilgrims to a shrine no more illustrious than scores of others, and call it the Via al Santuario, the Way to the Sanctuary? Partly on the solid rock of the mountain, partly on graceful arched bridges or viaducts, it leaps upward in short, acute angles, now spanning the dry bed of a torrente, now edging its way along the precarious parapet of a crag. Large, smooth pebbles set on edge in mortar, divided and bordered by three lengthwise parallel strips of lava or some other equally durable stone and crossed by other strips every fifty feet or so, make it apparently as enduring as Pellegrino itself. On either side rises a low, thick stone wall, and every few hundred yards are white signposts with the name in black letters. From the Piazza Falde - falde, in Italian, means flank, skirt - it leads upward in an easy ascent that continues for two or three hundred yards. But after the third turn, it takes a sudden inclination of twenty degrees or more out of the horizontal. That begins the real climb, - and the view. Palermo, the Conca d\\u2019Oro, the sea below, the mountains behind, appear and disappear with each turn, like the ever-changing film of a motion-picture. The Japanese say there are \\u201ctwo kinds of fools: those who have never ascended Fuji-yama, and those who have ascended him twice.\\u201d The proverb applies here on Pellegrino perfectly. It is as great a mistake not to make the journey once as it would be needless to make it a second time, for no one can ever forget the picturesque climb up that zig-zag road on donkey-back. When the writer went up, everybody who saw the miniature procession laughed. We three, beast, boy and man, made a sight Cervantes would have smiled to see. Equipped with a stout club, the plump boy answered very well for Sancho Panza. With my camera case over my shoulder in lieu of a target, and my tripod-legs projecting at impossible angles, I did very well as Don Quijote. And the faithful burro was surely a replica in miniature of Rosinante, long ears flopping disconsolately back over her neck. Instead of beating his beast as almost every other boy does when the animal balks at the steeper part of the ascent, \\u201cSancho\\u201d ran lightly forward and began picking up wisps of the straw gleaners had dropped on their way down the mountain. When he had a handful, he held the bunch of fodder out temptingly, and yelled \\u201cAaaaaa-ah-ah!\\u201d \\u201cRosinante\\u201d snorted, sniffed suspiciously, and with a suddenness that almost slid \\u201cDon Quijote\\u201d over her haunches into the road, bolted forward for the tidbit. A mouthful at a time it was given to her, and thus the hardest part of the way was quickly passed over without a blow being struck. \\u201cDo all the donkey-boys do this?\\u201d I asked, surprised at the humanity of the proceeding. \\u201cSancho\\u2019s\\u201d reply was disconcertingly frank. \\u201cOh, no, Signore. I am the only one. I can\\u2019t afford to buy a new donkey, and if I wear this one out, how can I bring forestieri at Pellegrino? The other boys beat their donkeys - yes! But then, they can get new ones every little while!\\u201d Once above the long series of viaducts that keep the road on an even plane of ascent over gullies and chasms, the way ceases to be so steep. On the rocky slopes, hardy Swiss cows graze among stones that seem incapable of yielding even thistles. When all the sparse grass is gone, with muzzle and hoofs the hard-working cows turn over boulders of considerable size and eagerly lick up the meager, pale blade or two of grass they conceal, finishing the attack by calmly devouring the fat little snails that cling to the moist earth and the under side of the big stones - I saw this myself. The cows have a hard time of it indeed, trudging out from the city every morning, grazing and rooting all day among the rocks, and then going down at night to be milked from door to door. But the goats have an even harder time. Some are seen every day on the very apex of the mountain, mere black specks against the sky. They clamber up there opposite the telegraph and semaphore stations without a thought of the journeys they must make in the evening. On coming back into town with heavy bags, their owners drive them ruthlessly up four or five flights of stairs to give some lazy customer as little as half a pint of their strong, rich milk. Near the top of this Via del Santuario is the roofless chapel of Croce, the Cross, which projects bastion-like from the jutting brow of the hill. Here every year a priest from the monastery on the heights, standing where he can see the whole splendid sweep of the Golden Shell below, a rippling sea of green and gold, returns thanks for its fertility during the past season, and beseeches heaven for a continuance of it for another year. The chapel of Santa Rosalia is in the gloomy cavern to which the lovely maiden fled to escape the temptations of her uncle\\u2019s court in Palermo; a court full of the factitious splendor and richness of the East, with Saracens all about and an atmosphere which, to say the least, was probably not conducive to saintly meditation. She is a mysterious and interesting figure, this daughter of the mighty Duke Sinibaldo and niece of King William the Good. How could she ever have cast aside the ease and luxury of the elaborate civilization in which she had been reared, and come to this stalactite grotto, dripping and cold, where her companions were no lords and ladies in waiting, but only the bats and small mountain animals seeking shelter from inclement weather? Exactly how long Rosalia maintained herself here in holy seclusion no one knows, but the date of her death seems to have been about 1170. In any event, she lay peacefully in oblivion until in 1624 some bones were discovered in the cavern. At that time a plague was raging, the city panic stricken, and when the bones were brought in to the Cathedral, the plague stopped. Such a coincidence was too striking to be ignored by the simple-minded, so Rosalia was canonized and appointed the patron of the city, because of her gracious intervention on behalf of the people against whose ancestors she had shaken off the dust of her feet. Filled with that dramatic religious fervor which has found its expression in so many wonderful pilgrimages, from the Crusades to the present, all Palermo toiled up the trackless hill to worship before the niche in the grotto where she died. Miracle after miracle was performed; and to-day the whole city, whether religiously inclined or not, is devoted to its female saint, whose relics are believed to be preserved in a huge funerary urn surmounted by her statue, and kept in the treasury of the Cathedral. The monument, which is solid silver, weighs more than fourteen hundred pounds. Every year her festival is celebrated with great pomp, a huge car, fifty feet high and as big as a house, being dragged through the streets amid the acclamations of the faithful. The float is also brought out in solemn procession whenever her intercession is especially desired for the city. No attention has been paid to the gratuitous information of a scientist that the saint\\u2019s relics are really only animal bones. The late Andrew D. White, in his \\u201cHistory of the Warfare of Science with Theology,\\u201d says: \\u201cWhen Professor Buckland, the eminent osteologist and geologist, discovered the relics of Rosalia at Palermo, which had for ages cured diseases and warded off epidemics, were the bones of a goat, this fact caused not the slightest diminution of their miraculous power.\\u201d Certainly no Palermitan to-day would listen to any Goth who attempted to tell him such a story as this; and even to heretic Americans, the \\u201cscientific\\u201d attitude which delights in iconoclasm is hard to comprehend. Why should the scientist who claims that his only wish is to benefit humanity, take from the poor and miserable any belief that heals them, however idle or superstitious that faith may seem to him? Eventually up on the mountain a chapel was constructed whose artificial wall meets the edges of the grotto, enclosing it completely. There is no roof to this outer section except over the front door; and the sunshine, falling upon the floor between entrance and choir, gives this open court the air of a pleasant vestibule roofed only by the azure, and throws into strong, shadowy relief the cavern beyond, with its candles twinkling in the dusk before the altars. A handsome black iron screen divides outer court from inner grotto; and both are paved with big, uneven stones worn to glassy slipperiness by the knees of the devout. The natural rock roof is weird and fantastic, covered with stalactic pendants, colored in all the shades of brown and green by the highly alkaline water that whispers perpetual requiem into myriad leaden gutters which carry it to the sides, and so preserve the decorations from destruction. Bent and twisted and angled, the gutters seem the branches of so many dead trees sprawling high among the jumbled rocks. At the rear of the chapel is a handsome white marble and mosaic altar, and nearer the front, enclosed in a glass case under an elaborate and massive shrine of highly colored marbles, is the figure of the saint over which Goethe rhapsodized. By the light of a flickering taper thrust between the marble bars, little by little the image within takes shape in the gloom. The head and hands are marble, the robes gilt. She seems to sleep naturally, a young girl of eighteen or twenty, her head easily disposed upon the pillow, her lips just apart; exactly, as the great German expressed it, as if she might breathe and move at any moment. Upon her breast blaze the crimson jewels of the Cross of Savoy, presented by Queen Margharita herself, and innumerable other tokens, among them a huge golden heart, the gift of a Palermitan cardinal. Gold and silver watches, jeweled rings, loose precious stones, bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments by the dozen lie about the glass casket or upon the gilded robes, which are exquisitely worked with lacelike tracery. And to one side is a gilt scepter fully five feet long. Opposite, on the wall, a white marble slab marking the niche where the bones lay, bears the words: VT QVO LOCO, ET SITV D. ROSALIAE SACRVM CORPVS ADMIRABILI OPERE LAPIDEIS THESIS INSERTVM ANNOS FERME CCCC DELITVERIT, QVOD MAIORES NOSTROS LATVIT, NOBIS DIVINITVS INNOTVIT POSTERI NON IGNORARENT: IPSIVS EXPIRANTIO IMAGO VBI IACVERAT SITA EST: ARA SUPERIMPOSTA ANNO IVBILAEI M DC XXV From the grotto-chapel, past a group of goatherds\\u2019 houses and through their attendant flocks, it is only about a quarter-mile stumble to a jutting spur which forms the highest crag of the mountain. Perched there between the halves of a dismantled arcade of plaster columns, stands a colossal figure of Santa Rosalia, hundreds of feet above the sea. Lightning has beheaded the statue twice, and the two marble heads lie in a little hollow at the saint\\u2019s feet. After the second bolt from the heavens the Sicilians, who are not by any means a wealthy people, put on a third head - a cheap plaster one; and though many a fierce storm has raged about Pellegrino since then, not once has the lightning struck the statue - perhaps the plaster head is not worth destroying. That all forestieri have money, so why shouldn\\u2019t they pay? is the logic of the Italian, and everywhere except in Sicily he carries it to the absurdities; and even in this blissful isle an individual sometimes forgets his geniality by turning highwayman for the nonce. A tatterdemalion goatherd, for instance, charged me sixteen cents for a milked-to-order pint of goat\\u2019s milk. \\u201cSancho\\u201d regarded the transaction with undisguised scorn. \\u201cBy Bacchus, but all forestieri are fools!\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you tell me to get it for you? I could get all you wanted for four cents!\\u201d Yet notwithstanding his philosophizing \\u201cSancho\\u201d generously let me off with only the usual gratuities. A day or so later - with so much yet undone - grieving that we must leave the island which had taken so mighty a grip on our hearts, we rolled down, for the last time, through the Place of the Four Winds, and went aboard the beautiful little Marco Polo. Half a dozen Nations decorated the Bay with their colors from a score of mastheads. Here lay a filthy little Greek tramp whose faded blue and white stripes fluttered limply from her steam-spitting stern; there a smutty white trading barque with gaping red seams and burnished copper, hairy a foot below the water line with grass and moss; yonder trim white steamers of the N. G. I. Disconsolate we sat on the promenade deck watching the lively scene along the Scala Florio. A tiny breeze was stirring, and the slip of new moon came staggering up the blue vault with the rotund body of her deceased mother in her thin little wide-stretched arms, followed at a respectful distance by a winking, blinking satellite. Pellegrino and distant Grifone showed soft and dim in blue and pink and gray, like the too closely cropped hide of a young donkey. On the wharf were tears and laughter. An eager crowd drove up in ever increasing numbers and thronged the space about the gangplank to give their friends a hearty send-off. Farther out a young girl sang atrociously to a wheezy handorgan, while a small boy, cap in his teeth, clambered over the Marco Polo\\u2019s rail and begged for pennies. A gold-laced official, with an important beard and furious mustachios, marched aboard with as dignified a stride as his five-feet-two permitted, and instantly the quiet ship became alive. Boatswains bellowed gruff orders, a steam-donkey somewhere forward chattered right merrily, and down in the hold the ingegniero \\u201cturned over\\u201d his engines to make sure everything was working properly. A serpentine hawser slipped from its bitt on the wharf and splashed writhing into the water at our feet - we were sailing. But no - at this very last instant a shout from the empty Place of the Four Winds a block away, stopped us. The heartiest send-off of all was yet to come. Roaring and spitting fire and smoke, a huge automobile in gray warpaint tore through the square, skidded to the edge, stopped as though it had rushed into a stone wall, and fairly shot a young man out upon the gangplank just as it quivered on the rise, while women shrieked and men laughed. His two companions were on the dock in a second, seized his shiny little black box-trunk, swung it to and fro once or twice, and hurled it after him with such precision that it caught the unlucky passenger in the small of his back and bowled him over squarely. As he was rising to his feet, white with astonishment and rage, his heavy handbag, thrown with the same forceful kindliness, knocked him down a second time, and ship and dock chorused happily together. Meantime the automobile panted contentedly as the fasts were cast off bow and stern, the screw began to revolve, and the white Marco Polo slipped out into the gathering night. Silently we fled the harbor, dotted now with myriad dancing lights; curtseyed gracefully out past Santa Rosalia\\u2019s statue, nine hundred feet aloft on the crag; dashed by small clusters of lights in a shadowy pocket of the outer hills, and were at sea again. Once more the long, slow roll of Mediterranean was under our feet, its grateful salt breath in our nostrils. A boy with the dinner-gong came yam-yam-yamming down the decks. We did not heed him. The whirling screw was throbbing a different refrain in our ears -  \\u201cThou art the garden of the world, the home Of all Art yields or Nature can decree; E\\u2019en in thy desert what is like to thee? Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste More rich than other climes\\u2019 fertility, Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.\\u201d THE END \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"result\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["As we can see, we have now added the results of our NER to our dataframe.
