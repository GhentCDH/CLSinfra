        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing (NLP), offering powerful capabilities in tasks like information extraction (IE) from historical texts. Chat-based generative models completely change the way we can interact with and analyse our corpora. These models enable users to engage with training data using natural language, revolutionizing communication paradigms and propagating a wide adoption of AI-tools across text-based tasks. However, concerns about **data privacy**, and **access** have arisen due to the dominance of closed-source models from industry giants like OpenAI and Google. To address these issues, there's a growing interest in open-source alternatives, which provide transparency and control over models and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook explores the potential of open-source LLMs for NER and aspect recognition in historical texts. We'll showcase zero- and few-shot learning to overcome **data scarcity**, a pivotal problem in applying IE in literary-historical contexts. We aim to showcase how open-source LLMs can illuminate the past and shape the future of historical scholarship!\n",

Side by side with the great churches that\\ngive them their crowning splendour are the public buildings,\\nuniversities, palaces, and fountains that tell the story of the glorious\\npast, and form the best monument of their great creators. These\\narchitectural jewels are often set amidst scenes of great natural\\nbeauty, which relieve and enhance the perfection of their art. Every\\ntraveller in Italy will recall the emotion with which he first saw Rome\\nrising from the green stretches of the Campagna, recognised the domes\\nand campaniles of Florence, or lifted up his eyes to one of those\\ntowered \\\"cities set upon an hill, which cannot be hid\\\" -- Siena, Perugia,\\nor Orvieto. Among the many appeals which Italy makes to \\u00e6sthetic\\nappreciation is that of infinite variety. In no country are the\\ndifferent styles and periods so wonderfully exemplified. Here we may\\nrange from Rome and Verona, with their relics of the antique\\nworld -- amphitheatres, temples, and therm\\u00e6 -- to the Byzantine glories of\\nRavenna and Venice, the Romanesque grandeur that finds typical\\nexpression in the cathedral of Pisa, and thence to the manifestations of\\nthat Gothic art which, though it was alien to the climate and character\\nof Italy and so struck no deep roots into the soil, intervened between\\nRomanesque architecture and that of the Renaissance as a brilliant\\nepisode, and finds stupendous expression in the thousand pinnacles of\\nMilan.\\n\\nIt is with Christian Italy that we have to deal, the Italy of\\ncathedrals, and it is at Ravenna and at Venice that we may trace the\\ndecline of Roman architectural methods and the gradual merging of these\\ninto Byzantine forms. Though the great Basilica Ursiana of the fourth\\ncentury has disappeared, Ravenna has preserved many famous monuments of\\nthe fifth century: the votive church of Galla Placidia, sister of the\\nEmperor Honorius, the Baptistery, the aulic church of the Gothic\\nconqueror Theodoric, Sant' Apollinare Nuovo, and the churches of San\\nVitale and Sant' Apollinare in Classe. Venice, rising to power and\\nsplendour when Ravenna fell on evil days, secured the heritage of her\\nglory, and carried on the Byzantine tradition in the cathedral of\\nTorcello, the church of San Zaccaria, and above all in the incomparable\\nSan Marco. At Pisa the Romanesque evolution culminated in a unique group\\nof buildings, famous throughout the world, while at Milan and in the\\nsurrounding district the local type of Romanesque became sufficiently\\nindividual to figure as an independent style under the title of Lombard\\narchitecture. Of this subdivision of Romanesque the prototype seems to\\nhave been the great church of Sant' Ambrogio at Milan, while San Michele\\nat Pavia is another early and important example. Italy's essays in\\nGothic are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the peninsula,\\nfrom Como to Naples. The Broletto at Como and the monastic buildings at\\nVercelli are said to have inaugurated them. Good examples are the\\ncathedral at Como, the church of San Francesco at Assisi, the cathedral\\nof Orvieto, San Petronio and San Francesco at Bologna, and San Lorenzo\\nat Genoa.\\n\\nBut it is to the Renaissance architecture of Italy that many of us will\\nturn as the most intimate expression of the Italian spirit, to the works\\nof Brunellesco, Michelozzo, and Cronaca at Florence, of Palladio at\\nVenice and Vicenza, of Bramante, and, above all, of Michelangelo at\\nRome, notably in his great life-work, the church of St. Peter. The\\nexuberant later style that resulted from a too ardent application of the\\nprinciples of Michelangelo and is known as Baroque, though generally\\nreprobated at present, must not be too sweepingly condemned. It had an\\nexponent of great talent in Bernini, and it will hardly be denied that\\nit gave grandiose expression to the tendency of a splendour-loving age,\\nand that Rome owes to its exponents much of the scenic effectiveness of\\nher streets and the impressive magnificence of her interiors.\\n\\n\\nCOMO\\n\\n\\nOn a flat piece of land at the southern extremity of Italy's most\\nbeautiful lake, the ancient Lacus Larius, stands a city whose history\\ndates back to the days when a Grecian colony nestled at the foot of the\\nmountains which lie east and west of the modern Como. Numerous relics of\\nRoman days found at different times, testify to the truth of the younger\\nPliny's letters that the Comum Novum of Julius C\\u00e6sar was in a\\nflourishing condition during the writer's life, and enjoyed all the\\nprivileges attached to a municipium .\\n\\nAt the present day Como is best known as a starting-point for tourists\\nwho board the steamers at the quay and leave their decks at one of the\\nmany delightful spots which fringe the shores of a lake whose\\nattractions cannot be overwritten. The sun shines on an endless panorama\\nwhich changes every minute as the steamer pants over the blue waters,\\nbreaking up and dispelling the reflections of verdure-clad slopes and\\nstern crags which lie mirrored on the surface. Hamlets like Nesso cling\\nto the rocks and bridge the orriao or torrent, as it enters the lake\\nin a foaming cascade. Monster hotel settlements like Bellagio and\\nCadenabbia lie further up the water, opposite to Varenna with its golf\\ncourse and English caravanserai. Little is left to remind one of those\\nbloody sixteenth-century days when Il Medeghino from his stronghold of\\nMusso ruled the lake, and with his fleet of seven big ships and\\ncountless smaller craft blockaded the City of Como, held for Charles V.\\nby the Marquis of Pescara, and compelled the Spaniards to come to terms.\\nNothing more warlike nowadays ruffles the serenity of the waters than\\nthe evil-looking little dogana craft which flash their light along the\\nshores, sweeping every tiny bay in search of contrabbandieri . Though\\nmuch could be written about the internecine wars the mountains have\\nseen, it is not with Gian Giacomo de' Medici this chapter is concerned,\\nbut with the city itself, which lies away out of sight of the great\\ncorsair's Castle of Musso.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Cathedral of Como, built entirely of marble, was commenced in 1396\\nfrom the plans of Lorenzi de' Spazi. The west fa\\u00e7ade, begun in 1460, was\\nfinished by Tomaso Rodario in the last few years of that century. It is\\nItalian Gothic, with the exception of the three doorways, which are rich\\nLombard work; and, like all fa\\u00e7ades of the same style in Italy, has the\\nappearance of simply facing or being stuck on to the building\\nitself. Despite the adornment of statues and bas-reliefs, scrolls and\\narabesques, it has a very severe and flat look, which is unrelieved by\\nthe recesses containing busts of the two Plinys on either side of the\\ncentral doorway, or the deep-set windows and canopied niches above. A\\nfine wheel window occupies a position above the principal door and\\nbetween these is a good Gothic screen with figures in five niches\\nflanked by a couple of windows on either side.\\n\\nThe north side of the fa\\u00e7ade adjoins the Brotello, through the arches of\\nwhich one reaches the north doorway. This is decidedly good. The porch\\nis supported by elegant pillars and adorned by arabesques with birds,\\nanimals, and other figures. It was executed from designs by Rodario, and\\nwith the south portal possesses all the merit that good Renaissance work\\ngives to both. The windows of the aisles are beautifully ornamented with\\ndecoration of the same character, and the slender pinnacles with their\\npierced galleries, albeit they remind one in their whiteness of the\\nsuperior pieces of an ivory chess set, break the line of the roof in a\\nmost agreeable manner. The dome lacks proportion and is of the over-done\\nstyle of French eighteenth-century work.\\n\\nThe interior of the cathedral is Gothic and Renaissance. The nave and\\naisles belong to the earlier date. The groining is good, but spoilt, as\\nis generally found to be the case throughout Italy, by gilded and\\ncoloured bosses which mar the otherwise simple effect of the vaulting.\\nThe transepts and choir are Renaissance, and though the sympathies of\\nthe northman are more with the sterner style, it must be owned that in\\nComo's cathedral the scheme of decoration found in these is more fitting\\nand better of its sort than in the Gothic half of the building. At the\\nwest end of the nave stands the circular Baptistery attributed to\\nBramante, close by which are a lion and lioness, the former grasping a\\ndeer and the latter suckling her young. They support the two holy water\\nbasins. Among the pictures of interest which the cathedral contains is a\\ngood Bernardino Luini of the Virgin, and two glazed and framed frescoes\\nof the Nativity and Adoration by the same hand.\\n\\nThe illustration shows the Brotello or old town hall, and the pinnacles\\nand north walls of the Cathedral. The Brotello is faced with banded\\nblack and white marble, the common device for exterior walls in most\\nItalian Gothic churches, and in this case justified by the beautiful\\ncolour it has taken on with age. The building stands mellowed by the\\nhand of Time, a memorial of the days of the old Italian Republics; and\\nits counterpart existed in every Lombard city. Above the arches, under\\nwhich the good citizens were wont to discuss the affairs of their town\\nwhile sauntering to and fro in the cool shade, is the great hall wherein\\nthe chief of the municipality assembled. From the window in the centre\\naccess was obtained to the bar, or ringhi\\u00e9ra outside, from which\\naddresses were delivered to the crowd below, who in constitutional\\nlanguage formed the parliamento and from whom the powers of government\\nemanated.\\n\\nTwo of the old city gateways still exist, the latter of which, the Porta\\ndel Torre, leading out on the high road to Milan is to-day but an empty\\nfive-storied shell. The old walls may be traced even now on the three\\nsides of the city away from the water-front. But for these there is very\\nlittle left to show the extent of a place which was once a serious rival\\nto Milan. The staple industry is stone-working, for which the Comaschi\\nhave for centuries been widely known. In former times Como was justly\\ncelebrated for the products of its looms, excelling in number those at\\nLyons. Nowadays it exports the raw silk; the looms have sadly fallen off\\nand diminished, and small industries have taken the place of those that\\nbrought considerable wealth to the pockets of its merchants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMILAN\\n\\n\\nWhen the great wave of conquest which swept mid-Europe in the fifth\\ncentury broke against the walls of Ch\\u00e2lons-sur-Marne and the westward\\nmarch of Attila and his Huns was checked, the defeated hordes of the\\nEast followed their chief across the Alps and invaded the plain that\\nstretches away now, just as it did in those far-off days, to the sunny\\nseas that beat against the southern slopes of the Apennines. In the\\ncentre of this plain stood Mediolanum, a city ranking second only to\\nRome, and her greatest colony in the Peninsula. So rich and prosperous a\\nplace became of necessity the object of attack, and the hosts that\\nlooked to \\\"the Scourge of God\\\" as leader, swept into and through the\\nfair city, sacking it completely. Rebuilt, but once again undergoing the\\nsame fate at the hands of Frederick I. in 1162, there remain but a\\ncolonnade of sixteen Corinthian columns near the Porta Ticinese, a few\\ntablets and fragments let into the walls of other gateways, and some\\nrelics in the museum, to tell of the past glories of Rome's great\\ncolony.\\n\\nMilan, as we know it now, is the centre of commercial Italy. Intersected\\nby an excellent system of tramways, with beautiful public gardens and\\nmagnificent buildings, it is up to date in every way and stands quite\\napart from all the other cities with which this book is concerned. The\\none thing that, perhaps, above all others places it in this position is,\\nhowever, no product of this commercial age, but its world-famous work of\\nart, the great cathedral, through the lofty aisles of which still\\nreverberates the grand music of the Ambrosian Ritual. The exterior of\\nthis immense church, next in Italy to St. Peter's in size, is adorned by\\na forest of spires, pinnacles, turrets and lace-like tracery. In the\\nmidst of all this rises the central tower with its airy spire, from the\\nbase of which on a clear day the snow-clad peaks of the Alps may be seen\\nstretching miles on miles away, and bounding the whole of the northern\\nhorizon by a lovely dreamland of colour.\\n\\nVery few buildings compel one's admiration as this does, an admiration\\nwrung in my case from a mind out of sympathy with everything that lacks\\nthe dignity of repose; but such is the effect obtained by hundreds of\\npinnacles and statues, by the turreted flying buttresses, by the filling\\nof every available foot of space with ornament, that one cannot but\\nappreciate the result of the skill and patience so truly Italian, which\\nhas carried out these infinite details and produced the great work that\\nstands in the Piazza del Duomo. The present fabric, dedicated \\\"Mari\\u00e6\\nNascenti,\\\" is the third cathedral built on the site: the first was\\ndestroyed by Attila in 452, and the second by Barbarossa in 1162. The\\nfoundation-stone was laid in 1387 by Gian' Galeazzo Visconti, who from a\\nnorthern clime sought his architect, Heinrich Ahrler, of Gm\\u00fcnden. From\\nthat time down to the present day many have had a hand in its making,\\namong them Bramante, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giulio Romano, and the\\nwonder is that the great structure is not far more full of incongruities\\nthan it is. The whole exterior is built of white marble from the\\nquarries of la Gandoglia on the Simplon Road, given by the founder for\\nthis purpose.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade rises with a course of open Gothic work to the gable above,\\nand is divided into five sections which terminate in clusters of Gothic\\nturrets surmounted by pinnacles and statues. The central doorway is\\nsurrounded by excellent Renaissance sculpture, the door itself being a\\nmagnificent piece of seventeenth-century bronze work. On each side are\\ntwo more portals. The bases of the intervening buttresses contain\\nsplendid panels, and the Caryatides, which support the slender Gothic\\nshafts right and left, by Rusca and Carabelli, are extremely good in\\npose and execution. The great fa\\u00e7ade designed by Pellegrini for S. Carlo\\nBorromeo in 1560 was never carried out owing to the saint's death while\\nPellegrini was away in Spain working on the Escorial for Philip II. The\\neast end is the oldest part of the building, and is almost entirely\\ntaken up by three grand Gothic windows. The east window, which is of\\nmost beautiful tracery, was executed from the designs of a Frenchman,\\nNicholas Bonaventure. Both the other windows are fine, but the upper\\nportion or rose pattern, although in itself very delicate, appears\\n\\\"stuck in,\\\" and not part of the design; some of the glass in these is\\nvery rich in colour. The archivolts of the arches are filled with\\nfigures which follow the curve in a rather uncomfortable style, not only\\nhere but in every other window save the fine classical of the fa\\u00e7ade.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe interior is grand, and of immense height, albeit the vaulting with\\nits admirably painted tracery is evidence of the great skill of the\\nItalian at \\\"faking.\\\" The mellow light from the amber coloured glass of\\nthe octagon and the twilight filtering through the gorgeous hues of the\\nother windows is remarkably and impressively pleasing. The columns of\\nthe nave, in clusters of eight shafts, are eighty feet high, and carry\\nnarrow capitals of foliage which form the base to eight canopied niches\\noccupied by figures of saints -- a fine feature. The aisles are double,\\nthe outside being lower than that next the nave. The four columns at the\\ncrossing which support the octagon are of larger dimensions than those\\nin the nave. Two semicircular pulpits covered with bas-reliefs of gilded\\nbronze stand on either side of the steps leading into the choir, to the\\nsolemn darkness of which the shadows thrown from the sounding-boards\\nabove make pictorially a good foreground introduction. These pulpits are\\nsupported by caryatides representing the Evangelists and four doctors of\\nthe Church.\\n\\nThe choir was designed by Pellegrini, and contains a fine\\nsixteenth-century tabernacle of gilded bronze. Beneath is the\\nsubterranean church, through which one enters the tiny chapel, under the\\ncentral spire, wherein is deposited, in a magnificent silver shrine the\\ngift of Philip IV. of Spain, the body of S. Carlo Borromeo dressed in\\nfull pontificals. Born in 1538 he was created cardinal by his uncle,\\nPius IV., in 1561. After the close of the Council of Trent he assisted\\nother prelates to draw up the epitome of Catholic doctrine, the\\n\\\"Catechismus Tridentinus\\\"; but it is more for his good works and great\\ncharity, especially during the plague of 1576, that he lives in the\\nhearts of the Milanese.\\n\\nIn the north transept is a very good example of the metal work of the\\nthirteenth century, in the shape of a fine bejewelled bronze\\ncandelabrum. It forms a tree and has many quaint figures in its\\nintricate design. In a chapel in this aisle is the old wooden crucifix\\nwhich S. Carlo carried when barefooted he tramped the streets during the\\nplague, tending the sick. In the south transept close to the corner near\\nthe staircase leading on to the roof is a monument to Giacomo and\\nGabriele de' Medici, brothers of Pius IV., and a bronze statue of S.\\nBartolommeo which represents him flayed. The south sacristy door is a\\nfine specimen of Gothic work. Unlike the exterior effect, nothing\\nobtrudes inside this great cathedral. The eye on entering looks straight\\nup to the east, conscious as it travels there, of great pillars rising\\ninto the gloom of the vault above, of fine glass and restful solemnity,\\nin which even the chapels in the aisles are lost, to be discovered later\\non only when searched for.\\n\\nNext to \\\"Mari\\u00e6 Nascenti,\\\" but taking precedence in arch\\u00e6ological\\ninterest, is the church of S. Ambrogio, a basilica dedicated by the\\nSaint when bishop of Milan in 387 to SS. Gervasius and Protasius. It was\\nenlarged and rebuilt in 881 and restored by Ricchini in 1631, all the\\noriginal features being faithfully preserved. A closed courtyard stands\\nbelow the level of the piazza outside and forms the Atrium beyond which\\nno catechumens were allowed to pass. The capitals of the columns here\\nhave the tendency of early Christian Art and adaptations of Runic and\\nByzantine carving. The church is Lombardo Romanesque. Beneath the\\ngallery over the peristyle is the celebrated door, well guarded by an\\niron grille, some of the cypress-wood panels of which formed portions of\\nthe gate of the Basilica Portiana closed by S. Ambrose against the\\nEmperor Theodosius after his cruel slaughter in Thessalonica. The nave\\nis entered by two side doors and is composed of eight bays, the columns\\nof which are slender in proportion for the deep shadows of the dark\\naisles. Pilasters run up to the low round vaulting, the large galleries\\nover the aisles being divided by these. Up a few steps which cross the\\nnave at the last bay, and behind a low marble balustrade, is the High\\nAltar, enclosed by one of the finest extant relics of the goldsmith's\\nart. This magnificent casing bears the name of its German maker,\\nWolvinius. Some of the panels, notably that of the Transfiguration, are\\nvery Greek in treatment. The back is almost of better workmanship than\\nthe front and is more interesting, as Wolvinius has here illustrated the\\nprincipal events in the life of the founder. The enamelled borders of\\nthese silver-gilt panels are of exquisite design. One of the saint as a\\nchild asleep in his cradle with a swarm of bees hovering around,\\nconsidered a presage of future eloquence, is very na\\u00efve. The\\n baldachino above this altar is borne by four grand columns of black\\nporphyry.\\n\\nUp twelve steps are the choir and tribune, and at the end of these is\\nthe primitive throne of the Archbishop of Milan, known as the chair of\\nS. Ambrose. The eighteen seats occupied by the suffragans of the\\nprovince no longer exist, having been replaced in the sixteenth century\\nby carved wooden stalls, and thus has perished a feature identical with\\nthe Cathedral at Torcello. The semi-domed roof of the Tribune is covered\\nwith a fine ninth-century mosaic which represents the seated figure of\\nthe Almighty, beneath whom are SS. Candida, Gervasius, Protasius,\\nMarcellina and Satirus, and a representation of the cities of Milan and\\nTours -- Tours because there, when S. Martin was undergoing martyrdom, the\\nspirit of S. Ambrose went to give him strength. Beneath the choir is the\\ncrypt, and at its termination, exactly under the high altar in the\\nchurch above, in a splendid casket of silver and crystal, repose the\\nremains of three Saints, Ambrose, Gervasius and Protasius. There is a\\ncurious pulpit in the church of very early Lombard work, with an \\\"Agape\\\"\\nor love feast carved upon its panels. Close by upon a granite pillar\\nrests a bronze serpent, said to be the brazen serpent of the desert and\\npresented to Archbishop Arnulphus by the Emperor of Constantinople. S.\\nAmbrogio was the church in which the Lombard rulers were crowned with\\nthe Iron Crown that is the chief attraction in the neighbouring city of\\nMonza.\\n\\nSo well known are the art treasures of Milan that it is hardly necessary\\nto do more than allude to the many works of great interest in the Brera,\\nformerly a Jesuit college, and in the celebrated Biblioteca Ambrosiana;\\nor that greatest wonder of all which has drawn so many pilgrims to the\\nCenacolo, the refectory near the church of Santa Maria della Grazie -- the\\nmuch restored Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. The Castello of Milan\\nwas at one time the residence of the great Visconti family, and at the\\ndeath of the last male representative passed by marriage into the hands\\nof the first duke of the Sforza line. It was during their reign that\\nMilan took the lead in the fashion of Europe (whence we have the word\\n\\\"milliner\\\") and it was then that Leonardo wrought his masterpieces,\\nincluding that great equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza which was the\\nwonder of Milan, and of which posterity was so unhappily robbed by the\\nFrench invasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPAVIA\\n\\n\\nFrom its position close to the confluence of the rivers Po and Ticino,\\nPavia, the \\\"City of a hundred Towers,\\\" was for centuries a point of\\nstrategic importance. It is at present a great artillery station. Of its\\nhundred towers that stood at intervals around the eleventh-century\\nwalls, hardly one remains, and the old fortifications which had been\\nreconstructed at a later date, are rapidly being converted into a\\nspacious and shady boulevard. The celebrated bridge is however still\\nintact, despite many violent floods, a delight to the eye and a pleasant\\npromenade on a hot day. This notable structure, which spans the Ticino,\\nwas built by one of the great Visconti family -- Gian' Galeozzo -- and is\\nroofed in.\\n\\nPavia at one time was rich in noble churches. Many have been demolished,\\nothers have fallen into decay. The cathedral, dedicated to S. Stefano,\\nstands on the site of one erected in the seventh century. The present\\nedifice was designed by Bramante and constructed under the direction of\\none of his pupils, Cristoforo Rocci. In the original plan the nave,\\ntransepts, and choir were all of one size, but the nave is the only part\\nin which the great architect's measurements were followed. The fa\\u00e7ade,\\napproached by a good flight of steps, is unfinished. On the north, and\\nadjoining a fine example of a late Romanesque gateway, stands the\\n campanile .\\n\\nThe interior of the main building is grey stone which has not been\\nspoilt by the application of the whitewash brush. A fine pulpit,\\nsomewhat similar to those at Milan, stands out from one of the massive\\npiers that support the octagon. It is of singularly large dimensions and\\nis supported by well-carved wooden figures of the Fathers of the Church.\\nThe octagon, which carries a good dome and tower and is best seen from\\nthe market square, rises well above the roofs of the nave and choir. A\\ngallery running round the entire cathedral forms a triforium, broken\\nonly by trasparente lights in the apse and side chapels of the choir.\\nThese windows accentuate the bad points of the barroque altars\\nbeneath. The clerestory lights are circular. If it were not for the\\nmagnificent tomb in which repose the remains of S. Augustine, the\\ngreatest of the Fathers of the Latin Church, the cathedral would be,\\nnotwithstanding the fame of its designer, the least interesting\\necclesiastical building in Pavia.\\n\\n \\n\\nExperts disagree as to who was responsible for the fine monument which\\ncovers S. Augustine's remains. The body of the saint had been removed\\nfrom Hippo, a suffragan see of Carthage, to Sardinia during the Arian\\npersecutions. It rested there until Liutprand, the Lombard king, having\\npurchased it, placed it in the church of S. Pietro in Cielo d'Oro; and\\nwhen this church was destroyed it was conveyed to the cathedral. On\\ncertain festivals the silver casket, portions of which are the original,\\nthat contains the bones of the saint robed in full pontificals is\\nremoved from its usual position and hoisted up behind the tomb, so that\\nthe devout can mount a temporary wooden stair and look on all that is\\nleft of the great father.\\n\\nA figure of the saint lies stretched on the sepulchral urn that usually\\nholds the silver casket. This rests on the basement, or lowest, of the\\nfour tiers that compose the monument. Around it are figures of the\\nlesser saints of his Order. Above are bas-reliefs of the chief events in\\nhis life and the miracles which after his death were performed in\\ndifferent places through his intercessions. The liberal arts, the\\ncardinal virtues, and many symbols adorn the tomb, which is also\\ndecorated with statues of saints and angels, two hundred and ninety in\\nall. They are extremely well executed and enhance the beauty of the\\ndesign.\\n\\nThe church of S. Michele is a primitive structure and bears traces of\\nbeing the precursor of all ecclesiastical edifices of the Lombard style\\nof architecture. It was originally a basilica, but short transepts have\\nbeen added and the roof, which is groined, is vaulted with stone. The\\noldest part of the church is the crypt, which is under the choir. This\\nis probably the building, or part of it, in which Unulfus sought\\nsanctuary in 661 when fleeing from King Grimoladus. Four compound piers\\nin the nave are adorned with an extraordinary series of sphinxes,\\nsymbols, animals and other figures. The fa\\u00e7ade is decorated with reliefs\\nin a richly coloured sandstone, and has a gabled gallery that is\\ncontinued round the exterior as far as the apse.\\n\\nThe portals are covered with a profusion of very archaic imagery in\\nwhich Pagan as well as Christian subjects form most of the decoration.\\nSculptured bands of sandstone are placed in courses along the whole\\nfront and medallions let into the walls. These are very massively built\\nof stone, and though restoration is evident throughout the church it\\nstill bears the impress of great age.\\n\\nSta. Maria del Carmine is a fourteenth-century building of Gothic\\ndesign, and is one of the very best examples of brickwork in all Italy.\\nThe beautiful rose window of the west front and the three pointed doors\\nwith their well-moulded terra-cotta ornament could hardly be finer.\\nSeven elegant pinnacles stand on the rather heavy cornice, forming a\\ngood set off to the campanile , which, surmounted by a brick spire, is\\na landmark in the district. The brick piers of the interior are\\nexceptionally good; four squares constitute the nave, the arches of each\\ncarry simple groining. Two small lancet-shaped arches, out of all\\nproportion with the massive brick piers that support them, open into the\\naisles. They have double capitals, the upper being of stone, the lower\\nof carved brick.\\n\\nIn the ruined church of S. Pietro in Cielo d'Oro stood the tomb of\\nBoethius, who under Theodoric held high office in the state. Boethius\\nwas executed in Pavia after a long and rigorous confinement in the Casa\\nMalsap ina, during which he wrote his incomparable \\\"Consolations of\\nPhilosophy.\\\" This work was translated into many languages and was one of\\nthe most widely known treatises in the Middle Ages. Alfred the Great\\ntranslated it into Saxon. Another connection with England exists through\\nArchbishop Lanfranc who accompanied William the Conqueror across the sea\\nand was made prelate of Canterbury. The district round Pavia is not\\nhealthy, a condition due probably to the intricate system of irrigation\\nby which the pastures are kept green with a rank-growing grass. Between\\nPavia, Piacenza and Lodi -- a triangle with the last-named at the\\nnorthern point -- lies the country which yields the best Parmesan cheese.\\nThe fields are of three kinds, those nearly always under water, those\\nirrigated, and those used for rotation crops. The cattle that are\\nutilised for cheese-making are mostly Swiss bred, and being valuable are\\nwell looked after. They are stalled at sundown in the buildings attached\\nto the great farms, where farmhouse, cottages, barns and stables are all\\nenclosed within a high wall. The little rectangular patches of meadow on\\nwhich they feed are enclosed by rows of poplars or willows which make\\nthe landscape very monotonous. In winter a dense fog often shrouds the\\ncountryside and a deadly chill pervades the atmosphere, while the\\nhumidity of summer, when the sun draws the moisture from the soaking\\nearth, is very enervating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBERGAMO\\n\\n\\nWhen October comes in its yearly round and the autumn afternoons close\\nin, it is sometimes good to sit idly outside a caff\\u00e8 with the pernicious\\ncigarette and ruminate on the glories of a past summer -- better this than\\nto hustle up the street a sight-seeing. A hot day was ending and the\\nBergamo of medi\\u00e6val times towered above the haze of a sun-baked land and\\nthe smoke that curled upwards in thin wreaths from the city below. \\\"La\\nCitt\\u00e0 Alta\\\" thus raised its head proudly against the copper-coloured\\nsky, thrusting its bulwarks to the edge of one of the last spurs of the\\nAlps that here creep down on to the plain. What a grand prospect from\\nthe shady boulevard on those ramparts which encircle the old fortress!\\nThe sun has not yet set; beneath lies the Borgo S. Leonardo, the lower\\ncity, a busy place with factory chimneys on its outskirts; beyond, a sea\\nof verdure, cut by lines of tall poplars and here and there a slender\\n campanile , stretches away over Lombardy until lost in the haze past\\nthe towers and domes of Monza, Cremona, and distant Milan.\\n\\nThere is something very fascinating in the quiet and exclusive old city.\\nIts streets are steep and narrow, its houses seem to rake the sky, the\\nrattle of wheels does not often disturb the aristocratic silence, a\\nsilence accentuated tenfold when one has left behind its busy plebeian\\npartner on the plain below, and whisked upwards by the funicular, found\\noneself suddenly amidst high walls. Great spaces of faced stone are\\nthese walls, pierced by tiny windows, almost forbidding in their\\nausterity; and though glimpses of foliage and flowering creepers break\\nthrough, the pervading air is one of mystery and intrigue.\\n\\nIn the wars with Austria, Bergamo was a great rallying-point for\\npatriots and a continual thorn in the side of that polyglot empire. The\\nnames of heroic Bergamasque who died for their country are inscribed on\\nsundry tablets on the walls under the old Brotello. This interesting\\nbuilding stands at one end of the little Piazza Garibaldi, and is\\nsomewhat similar to the one which forms the illustration to Como, with\\nthe difference that here a fine open stairway leads up to the first\\nfloor. The great hall is now occupied as a library. In a corner at the\\nhead of the stairs rises a massive quadrangular belfry, one of the\\nprominent features in the outline of \\\"La Citt\\u00e0 Alta.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nBeyond the Brotello lies the Cathedral, a well-proportioned Renaissance\\nbuilding, which, by its juxtaposition to the much more ancient church of\\nSta Maria Maggiore, looks comparatively of recent date. It is\\nconstructed entirely of white marble and has a good dome. A Madonna by\\nG. Bellini behind the high altar is its great treasure, and the only\\nthing in it worthy of notice.\\n\\nSta Maria is an early Lombard pile of buildings, with a very lofty tower\\nand an octagon over the crossing, which rises in four galleried storeys\\nsurmounted by a low spire. Good galleries extend round the exterior of\\nthe apse, and side chapels are thrust out at odd places with no\\nparticular plan. The east porch is by far the most interesting feature,\\nand is an elaborate piece of work in breccia and white marble. The\\nsupporting pillars rest on the backs of two lions, the old\\necclesiastical symbol of strength, the columns of the portal are\\nbeautifully sculptured, and one of them, encircled with admirable\\nfigures, is very fine. Above is a canopy under which, on his horse, sits\\nKing Lupus with two attendants, while beneath a second canopy on top are\\nstatuettes of the Virgin and Child, and the two Marys. The west porch is\\nalmost similar to this, but of not so intricate a design. It has also no\\ncanopies, but is surmounted by a turret niche, let into the wall of the\\nmain building, in which is the figure of the patroness. The doors of\\nthese two portals are of superbly grained rosewood. They open into the\\ntransepts, which are the finest portions of the interior, the carved\\nchoir stalls and screen by Stefano da Bergamo are considered the best in\\nItaly.\\n\\nAdjoining the east porch is the Capella Colleoni, the mausoleum of\\nBartolommeo Colleoni the celebrated condottiere of the fifteenth\\ncentury, whose equestrian statue in front of the church of SS. Giovanni\\ne Paolo in Venice is remarkable, not only as a work of art, but as\\nexemplifying the power and rugged strength of a great man.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade is terribly ornate, with chequer work in white and black\\nmarble, red and yellow busts and medallions, twisted pillars and strange\\narabesques. The interior contains the tomb of Bartolommeo who sits\\nastride his horse. It is rather too elaborate to be entirely pleasing.\\nAt the south end is one of the finest examples of intarsia , or inlaid\\nwood-work, in Italy. The subjects of the three panels represent the\\nentry into Jerusalem, and scenes from the stirring times in which the\\ngreat condottiere played so prominent a part. The backgrounds are\\nevidently of landscape in the neighbourhood. Not only is the spirit and\\nexecution of this fine work extremely good, but the colour surpasses\\nanything of the sort I have seen. It is kept under lock and key,\\nenclosed in three rosewood panels of well-selected grain. Not far from\\nthe chapel is the house in which Donizetti died. The Borgo S. Leonardo\\nis of older date than \\\"La Citt\\u00e0 Alta,\\\" although it is the more modern of\\nthe two. On the base of a damaged Corinthian column standing in the\\nsmall piazza of Sta Maria d'Oleono is an old Latin inscription which\\ntells that the column was erected where once stood a heathen temple, and\\nthat S. Alessandro, standard-bearer to the Theban Legion, overthrew the\\nheathen pillar by a miracle, the column being erected by members of the\\nmunicipality with the alms of the faithful. It is doubtful whether the\\nPergamus of ancient writers is the city on the hill or its sister on the\\nplain; this relic rather points to the latter as the site. In the Borgo\\na fair, held for a month from the middle of August, and known as the\\nFiera di Sant' Alessandro, has taken place without intermission since\\nthe tenth century -- surely a record; and there is no doubt that in the\\nancient Italian drama, harlequin, personifying the manners and jargon of\\nthe neighbouring Val Brembana, was a Bergamasque, and originated at this\\nancient festival.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBRESCIA\\n\\n\\nBrescia, like Bergamo, is situated on the fringe of the mountains and\\nthe plains, and like Bergamo played an important part in the wars\\nagainst Austria. Its castello stands high above the rest of the city,\\nbut in the face of the power possessed of modern arms it would not be\\nworth a garrison. So its ramparts and entrenchments have been wisely\\nconverted into a pleasant garden from which wide views of rolling\\ncountry and level plain extend.\\n\\nMany traces of the Roman colony of Brescia remain, but it was due to a\\nsmall boy of the virile race that populate the city that the most\\ninteresting was unearthed. When a child, Girolamo Ioli was much\\nexercised in mind about a Corinthian column that stuck out of the ground\\nand around which he was wont to play. In maturer years the curiosity of\\nyouth was still the ruling passion, and he made it his business to\\nagitate. Like many another agitator his demands were in time gratified,\\nand excavations were commenced which resulted in the unearthing of a\\nbuilding erected by Vespasian it is supposed in the year 72 -- the\\nsupposition resting on fragmentary inscriptions. Palace of Justice or\\ntemple, this building is now the museum, and contains one of the finest\\nbronzes Italy can boast of. Found in 1826, this beautiful winged figure\\nof Victory, which is six feet high, still bears a trace of the silver\\nfillet interwoven with a wreath of laurel-leaves that bound her hair.\\nThe last-century additions of a shield, which she was thought to have\\nheld, and a helmet under one of her feet, have been removed, and Victory\\nstands in the state in which she was discovered. The head and limbs are\\nfinely modelled, and the arrangement of the drapery could not be\\nexcelled.\\n\\nDown the wide street in front of the Museum a Corinthian column and\\nheavy frieze, supported by massive brick pillars, have been excavated.\\nOpposite these relics is the huge Martinengo Palace. In a line due south\\nis the church of Sta Afra built on the site of a temple to Saturn. Most\\nof the houses in the vicinity have Roman masonry in their basements and\\nRoman inscriptions let into their walls. From this one gathers that\\nancient Brixia occupied this part of the later city. Write it down to\\nthe credit of Brescia that her citizens passed a law as early as 1480\\nthat all antiquities found should be preserved and given up to the town.\\n\\nThere are two cathedrals in Brescia, La Rotunda and the Duomo Nuovo.\\nThe former is one of the most interesting ecclesiastical buildings in\\nItaly. Constructed of stone, with a red brick dog-tooth cornice and\\ntwenty-four brick arches, supported by white marble pilasters forming an\\narcade into which the exterior is divided, a most pleasing effect is\\nobtained. In the interior a circular colonnade, composed of eight\\nextremely massive four-sided piers bearing round arches, supports the\\nstone dome. It is supposed to be of seventh-century construction, and is\\nevidently on the site of an earlier Roman building, as fragments of a\\nmosaic floor exist beneath the present one. This, which is partly\\ntesselated, is much below the level of the ground outside. Lower still,\\nbeneath the presbytery and choir, down twenty steps, is a very ancient\\ncrypt, in which forty marble columns support the round arches that carry\\nthe weight of the fabric above. None of these columns is more than five\\nfeet high. Half a dozen blocked up lights, with bases not more than\\nthree feet from the floor, are evidence that outside, the level of the\\nground was at one time far below where it is at present.\\n\\nThe Duomo Nuovo is a finely proportioned edifice and one of the best\\nseventeenth-century churches in the country. The fa\\u00e7ade is immense and\\ngains by its simplicity. The fine dome is said to be the third in size\\nin Italy; and the lofty interior of white marble, unspoilt by any colour\\nor decoration, gains in space from the fact that there is but one bay to\\nthe nave, producing the effect on the senses that one is everywhere\\nstanding under the spacious height of Brescia's greatest landmark. The\\nhouses of the piazza outside are chiefly occupied by metal-workers, and\\nthose who know the incessant din produced by the tapping of their\\nhammers, will quite understand that it was impossible to make a sketch\\nof these two churches as they stand together.\\n\\n \\n\\nAdjoining the Duomo Nuovo is the Brotello with its fine Torre del\\nPopolo, an embattled tower. The inner courtyard is partly of red brick\\nwith a good corridor of the thirteenth century, formed of pointed and\\nround arches and brick groining. Another fine tower stands in the Piazza\\nVecchia, the Torre del' Orologio. Its enormous dial marks the hours from\\nI to XXIV, the course of the sun and moon, and has the signs of the\\nZodiac displayed on its face. Two figures that stand on top of the tower\\nstrike the hours in a similar way to those on the Clock Tower of Venice.\\nAt the west end of the piazza is La Loggia, the town hall, a good\\nexample of an early sixteenth-century building. It was commenced, to be\\naccurate, by Tornasso Formentone in 1492 and continued from his\\ndesigns as far as the first floor. Sansovino was responsible for\\nthe second, and Palladio completed what the other two had begun. The\\nbuilding, however, as a whole, is superb. Magnificent arches support the\\nfirst floor, to which a grand open staircase leads. The medallions and\\nfigures which adorn the exterior are extremely good, and the frieze and\\ncornice are equally so. The rich colour of the marble employed lends a\\nbeautiful tone to a beautiful building. Unfortunately the interior was\\nburnt out in January 1575. The fire which consumed it is supposed to\\nhave originated at the instigation of those who wished to destroy\\ncertain ancient charters granting liberties to the inhabitants.\\n\\nThe Torre della Pallata is in a corner of the square -- a good specimen of\\ncastellated architecture, which rises from a sloping base of immense\\nstones and terminates with a projecting turret.\\n\\nBrescia contains many fine palaces, and from the streets into which they\\nopen one often gets a glimpse, through the iron grille of their portals,\\nof a charming arcaded court. The splash of a flower embowered fountain\\nis music to ear and the cool shade under the arches a rest for eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVERONA\\n\\n\\nThose who enter the Brenner Pass, and with faces set towards Italy,\\nleave Innsbruck behind, may have noticed how, after toilsome puffing and\\nstraining uphill, the train suddenly seems to draw breath and glide\\nsmoothly onwards with increased pace. At the side of the iron road a\\nlittle thread of water dances merrily over a pebble bed in its haste to\\nreach the sunny plains that lie to the south of the great mountain\\nbarrier. Further on the rail and its sparkling attendant part company to\\njoin later, when, from their slender origin, the waters have become a\\nrushing river -- the river Adige. The mountains are behind, to the north;\\nthe character of the landscape has changed, and within a horseshoe bend\\nof the swift stream, well-nigh enclosed by it, lies Verona.\\n\\nVerona \\\"La Degna,\\\" Verona the Worthy, a city crammed with the history of\\npast wars, a city of colour, in its bricks, in its stones, in its marble\\nwalls and fresco adorned palaces. Wherever one turns, be it the pale\\ngreen of the river on which the wheels of those watermills, so like the\\nNoah's Ark of childhood's days, for ever turn, or the brilliant and\\nkeen blue of the sky, there is always colour for the eye in Verona.\\nColour for the mind too lies concealed in its streets and buildings.\\nGreek, Roman, Ostrogoth and Frank, Italians and Austrians, have all\\nruled here. Ruled and gone and left their trace on this beautiful\\ncity -- the key to Alt' Italia -- which Italy once more holds and guards\\nwith jealous eye. Long may she keep it.\\n\\nVerona is connected with two great names in the history of Italian\\narchitecture, Fr\\u00e0 Giaconda, the monk who in the early days of\\nRenaissance was supreme in the north, and Sanmicheli. Many of the fine\\npalaces the former designed bear evidence of his talent and justify the\\nsummons to Rome, where he went at an advanced age to superintend the\\nbuilding of St. Peter's. The latter, who evolved the triangular and\\npentangular bastion, is more widely known in the science of\\nfortification than as a builder. Fr\\u00e0 Giacondo's finest work in Verona is\\nundoubtedly the Palazzo del Consiglio, the old town hall called \\\"La\\nLoggia,\\\" which stands on the north side of the Piazza dei Signori, one\\nof the most architecturally beautiful squares in Italy. The Palazzo\\ndella Ragione, with a courtyard and grand open stairway of the\\nfourteenth century, is on the south of the square next door to the\\nTribunale, and the Prefettura is opposite. The fine portal of the\\nlatter is one of Sanmicheli's works. These magnificent buildings, with\\nthe exception of the first-named, were all at one time or another\\npalaces of the great family of Scaligeri or Della Scala, and in one of\\nthem Dante, whose statue is in the centre of the Piazza, found refuge\\nwhen driven from Florence.\\n\\nThe family of Scaligeri, although settled in Verona as early as 1085,\\ncomes first before the historian at the death of the bloody tyrant\\nEzzelino in 1261. Verona, freed from his terrible rule, became at that\\ndate a free town, and Mastino della Scala accepted the office of\\nCapitano del Popolo. Onwards for over a hundred years the Scaligeri\\ngoverned Verona; and during the reign of the most famous of the race,\\nFrancesco, or \\\"Can Grande,\\\" Great Dog, it became the gathering-place for\\nmen of note of all sorts, and his palace the home of the great poet. The\\nfamily crest, a ladder, is to be seen all over the city, while the\\nunique group of the Scala tombs is without a parallel.\\n\\nThis wonderful group stands outside the little church of Sta Maria\\nAntica at the end of a passage leading out of the Piazza dei Signori.\\n\\nOf these tombs, that of Mastino I. is a simple sarcophagus ornamented\\nwith nothing but a cross. It was at one time covered with a canopy, but\\nthe stones of this, being handy, were used for the restoration of Sta\\nMaria Antica close by. The tomb of Can Grande forms the canopy over the\\nportal of this church. Columns support its three storeys. Upon a\\nsarcophagus lies an effigy of the Great Dog with his good sword at his\\nside; above is his equestrian statue in full armour. Mastino II, who\\nsucceeded his uncle Can Grande, is likewise represented by a recumbent\\nfigure on the sarcophagus of his tomb, which is also crowned by an\\nequestrian statue in armour. The visor of his helmet is drawn down, and\\nthereby hangs the tale that Mastino was ashamed to show his face, even\\nto his wife, after he had treacherously slain with his own sword his\\nrelative, Bishop Bartolommeo della Scala. Can Signorio's monument,\\nthough not the most elaborate, is decidedly the finest. At the four\\ncorners under beautiful pointed canopies, are the figures of Sigismundo,\\nAlexius, St. George, and Signorio himself. A great deal of the bronze\\nwork and detail about this tomb is very good, and the equestrian figure\\non the top is excellent. There, gathered together, these warrior princes\\nof the great family repose in their last long sleep. Those who deem the\\npen mightier than the sword, may care to reflect that a fame more\\nuniversal and lasting than that of all the Delia Scalas has been\\nattained by a French scholar of the sixteenth century who also bore the\\nname of Scaliger. Yet even this prince of learning was prouder of his\\ntraditional descent from the noble Veronese house than of all his\\nachievements in the world of letters.\\n\\n \\n\\nAnd Verona's churches? Tradition says that Charlemagne erected the first\\nbuilding on the site of the Cathedral. The present edifice, though\\nalmost entirely reconstructed in the fifteenth century, was commenced in\\nthe tenth. The most ancient part that remains, probably a portion of the\\nfirst church, is the apse, which on its exterior bears traces of Roman\\ninfluence. It is very simply built of a small cut grey freestone, faced\\nwith flat pilasters terminating in Roman capitals, above which is a\\nfrieze of floral pattern. In the remainder of the building Verona marble\\nand the rich yellow stone of the district are used.\\n\\nThe double-arched west porch of the twelfth century is exceptionally\\ngood. Two colossal gryphons support elegant columns, and still command a\\ncertain amount of awe amongst the smaller children who play about the\\nPiazza del Duomo. Both arches are round; the lower is supported by four\\ncolumns, the upper by eight. Representations on the inner shafts of the\\nlower arch of the two Paladins, Roland and Oliver, give a semblance to\\nthe tradition that Charlemagne had something to do with the first church\\nerected here. Oliver holds his celebrated sword, on which is inscribed\\n Du-rin-dar-da . Roland is cross-legged and bears his shield. They are\\nboth seen in the illustration. The colour of this porch and fa\\u00e7ade is\\nvery beautiful. Great blocks of red marble intermingle with yellow\\nstone, white and pink marble courses continue the construction above,\\nand arabesques of a weathered grey stone complete the harmony. The fine\\nsouth portal is an earlier erection. Some ancient frescoes decorate the\\nlunette, and monsters grin at one like a nightmare from above.\\n\\nThe interior is lofty and very striking. Tremendous columns support the\\nlow Gothic roof, the vaulting of which hardly exceeds the height of the\\narches between the nave and aisles. Many signs of \\\"giving way\\\" and\\ncracks in the masonry have necessitated iron girders, which detract\\nsomewhat from a fine effect. The heavy capitals of the nave columns are\\nrendered rather unsightly by three courses of floral design. The aisles\\nare pointed, narrow, and very good. Encircling the high altar is a\\ncolonnade screen, which though beautiful in itself and designed by\\nSanmicheli, is sadly out of place. The fine bronze crucifix which\\nsurmounts it is by Gianbattista da Verona.\\n\\nThe cloisters lie on the north side of the Cathedral. About half a dozen\\nfeet below the level of the pavement, standing on its base, is a fine\\nCorinthian column, with a Roman floor around. Between them and the\\nearly Lombard church of S. Giovanni in Fonte is a tortuous corridor\\nlined with sepulchral slabs of many archbishops and bishops. This little\\ndark church is formed of four small bays and was formerly the old\\nbaptistery. In the centre of the nave stands a huge octagonal font, with\\na smaller one inside, wherein stood the officiating priest. The figures\\nin bas-relief on these two fonts, which by the way are cut from one\\nsolid block of marble, are well worth studying.\\n\\nAnother Gothic church is Sant' Anastasia, which was commenced by the\\nDominicans in the thirteenth century and is still incomplete. The nave\\nis very fine and has the same low vaulting that is a feature in the\\nCathedral; its walls, too, are cracked and held together by iron\\ngirders. Close to the west door in the interior are two humpbacked\\nfigures which hold the Holy Water basins and are of some interest. One\\nof them was executed by the father of Paolo Veronese and the other by\\nAlessandro Rossi, who took his cripple son \\\"Gobbino\\\" for his model.\\n\\nThe most interesting ecclesiastical fabric in the city is, however, the\\nchurch of San Zenone. It is unspoilt by anything flamboyant or gaudy,\\nand is a fine example of Romanesque architecture -- some consider it the\\nfinest in North Italy. A ninth-century building stood here before the\\npresent structure was begun in 1138. The west fa\\u00e7ade is marble, the\\napse and sides of alternating brick and marble courses. The great portal\\nis a most elaborate example of early twelfth-century work, on which are\\nrudely sculptured knights engaging in deadly combat, scriptural subjects\\nand imitations of Roman bas-reliefs with Latin inscriptions. Theodoric\\non horseback, with feet in stirrups -- a very early representation of\\nsuch -- and Roman dress, engages in the chase of the deer with the Devil.\\nThe attendant dogs are evil spirits furnished to the Emperor by the\\nArch-fiend. The ninth-century bronze doors are very remarkable and\\nconsist of forty-two square plates fixed on to pine-wood. The subjects\\nof each panel, which are Biblical, are most interesting; some of the\\nlittle figures wear the conical flat-brimmed hat that may still be seen\\non the heads of the shepherds in the more remote districts of Venetia.\\nThese doors boast no handles, but two huge grotesque heads do duty\\ninstead, and are the means of opening and closing them. Above the portal\\nis a wheel-of-fortune window executed by Briolotus. At the top is the\\nfigure of a king, and at the bottom lies a prostrate man; between these\\ntwo are many figures climbing up and falling down in their efforts to\\nreach the best place. The fa\\u00e7ade terminates in a gable, with a lean-to\\non either side.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe interior is very striking, not only in its good proportions but in\\nits simplicity, which no side-altars mar. As in the cathedral at\\nChester, one enters from the west down a flight of steps, held a moment\\nin admiration by the solemn grandeur of this fine church. The beautiful\\nlarch roof soars away far above the mellowed floor, the warm colour of\\nthe walls and depth of shadow through the arches of the crypt below the\\nchoir, create a harmony of colour from our point of vantage not often\\nmet with in Italy's churches. The aisles are divided from the nave by\\nalternate piers and red marble pillars, the former with ascending Doric\\npilasters, two of which, near the west end, support a flying arch\\nbeneath the roof and are evident traces of an early vaulting. At the end\\nof the nave, and occupying its last three bays, is the raised choir\\nreached by two flights of marble steps on either side of those leading\\ndown into the crypt. On the red marble balustrade of the choir are\\nfigures of Christ and the twelve apostles. In a niche on the south side\\nis a forbidding looking figure of S. Zeno, the patron saint of the city,\\nwho, being an African, is represented with a black face. The apse at the\\neast end was rebuilt in the fifteenth century and has Gothic windows.\\n\\nThe old Benedictine cloisters of the once attached monastery stand on\\nthe north, and contain amongst other tombs twenty-nine of the Della\\nScalas. The cloisters and tombs are admirably preserved. The former\\nconsists of brick arches, pointed on the east and west, and round on the\\nnorth and south, supported by coupled columns of red marble. Of Verona's\\nforty churches these three are the most typical and interesting, and San\\nZenone, with its great architectural simplicity and wonderful\\n campanile , holds the palm.\\n\\nIt is a city of shapely bell-towers; every church has one. Some are\\nhigh, others low and unpretending; some are flat topped, others\\nembattled or crowned by the red brick spire which greets one further\\nwest in the lake country. But the most beautiful of all is that which\\nstands at a corner of the Piazza dei Signori, adjoining the Palazzo\\ndella Ragione, and rears its head over two hundred and fifty feet from\\nthe pavement below. Like a queen, this graceful Campanile del Municipio\\nstands, dominating her subjects the other towers, with all the tinkling\\nbells they contain. Across the river from the vantage-ground of the\\nterrace on the hill beneath the Castello S. Pietro, Verona lies mapped\\nout. Her dull red and brown roofs remind one of the harmonious colours\\nof a Bokharan rug. Immediately below, at the foot of the hill, are the\\nruins of the Roman theatre, and the green waters of the Adige, rushing\\nunder the arches of the old stone bridge close by. Straight as a line\\nran the Roman street to the Porta dei Borsari, erected under the\\nEmperor Gallienus in 265, and out into the country beyond. Between this\\nold gateway, which stands athwart the street almost blocking it, and the\\nriver, is medi\\u00e6val Verona, intersected and crossed by hundreds of\\n vicoli , or lanes, and full of subjects for a painter's brush in the\\n cortili that fringe them. At the corner of the Vicola Pigna and the\\n\\\"Alley of the Jutting Stone,\\\" is a low marble column with a huge\\nfir-cone on the top, a reminiscence of Roman days. Near at hand is the\\nfine palace that Sanmicheli erected for the Miniscalchi family, and in a\\nlane a few steps away, a crumbling remnant of another fine house with a\\nbeautiful portal and row of windows. These are but a few things in the\\nsecluded byways of old Verona, where one's feet continually led one on\\njourneys of discovery. Many a silent and deserted courtyard I found,\\nwhere the grass shyly thrust its head between the cobblestones, and\\nwhere creepers came wantonly trailing down over old walls in a sweet\\nendeavour to hide the decay of man's handiwork.\\n\\nFrom all these it is but a step to the focus of the city's life, the\\nPiazza delle Erbe, the forum of Roman rule, and the most picturesque\\nmarket square in Italy. In the centre -- and seen in the sketch -- is the\\nsmall open tribune which occupies the place of an old building where\\nthe newly elected Capitano del Popolo was invested with the insignia of\\nhis office. The fountain farther up the square was erected by\\nBerengarius in 916, and supplied with fresh water by Can Signorio. The\\nfigure surmounting it gazes stonily every day over a sea of umbrellas\\nwhich shelter the market folk below. Can Signorio beautified his native\\ncity, and erected the tower at the end of the piazza -- a tower which can\\nboast of the first public clock. The Lion of St. Mark stands on an\\nisolated column, surrounded by vegetable and fruit stalls, in front of\\nthe Palazzo Tresa, a highly ornate specimen of the seventeenth century.\\nMany of the old houses still bear traces of the frescoes which covered\\nthem, and which at one time must have made Verona's streets veritable\\ngalleries of decorative art. Others retain the marble balconies which\\nformed so fascinating a feature of the city's architecture.\\n\\n \\n\\nOf earlier days there still remains one of the grandest ruins in\\nItaly -- the celebrated Amphitheatre. It was the night of a hot day; a\\nblood-red moon, mounting on her upward path in the copper-coloured sky,\\nleft a grim mass of deep shadow beneath. Bats were hawking in and out of\\nthe black shadow, as yet unrelieved by the electric lights, and the\\nspacious piazza was nearly empty. An ominous feeling, intensified by\\nthe distant hum of the busier parts of the city, unsettled one's\\nnerves. My thoughts travelled back to the time when, there behind that\\ngloomy mass, slaves would be cleansing the arena after a scene of cruel\\nsport, and the distant hum was nothing but the excited throngs\\ndiscussing the brutal slaughter. Did the great poet in his twilight\\nwanderings ever see such a moon and such a sky? It was certainly an\\nevening that would have enticed him to shun the noisy company of his\\nfellow men and saunter alone in the shadow of the great Amphitheatre.\\nPerhaps his spirit was there now. Small wonder that in my dreams that\\nnight the howls of a cruel audience and the gentleness of the lonely\\npoet were mixed up in inextricable confusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPADUA\\n\\n\\nThe quaint old city of Padua lies on the beaten track to Venice. In its\\ngreat Basilica repose the remains of St. Anthony. Giotto's frescoes in\\nthe Church of the Madonna are still a glory to behold, its university is\\none of the oldest in Europe, and the modern epicure can drink coffee of\\nthe very best at Pedrocchi's, an establishment as well known amongst\\nItalians as the celebrated Florian's at Venice. The origin of Padua goes\\nback to Antenor, whose tomb occupies a corner near the Ponte de Lorenzo\\nclose to the house at one time inhabited by Dante. A sarcophagus was\\ndiscovered in 1274 during excavations for the building of a foundling\\nhospital, and when opened, a skeleton of immense size, one hand still\\ngripping a sword, was seen inside. Who could it be but Antenor? There\\nwas Virgil's authority for it that he had founded Padua -- so Antenor it\\nwas who lay there in his stone coffin, and the good folk of Padua\\ncarried the sarcophagus and its contents to the church of S. Lorenzo\\namidst great excitement. The church has been demolished but the tomb was\\nspared.\\n\\nPadua's tortuous streets are lined with arcades, and although modern\\nrequirements have ordained that some should be altered and the houses\\npulled down, it still preserves an air of medi\\u00e6val antiquity. Situated\\non the winding little river Bacchiglione and intersected by other small\\nstreams, it forms in the itinerary of the tourist a sort of prelude to\\nVenice. Innumerable bridges span these waterways. Some of them are of\\nRoman construction; and wherever one's footsteps lead one, be it along\\nthe riviere -- the open streets that run by the side of the streams -- or\\nthe narrow ways that may be likened to a rabbit warren, the great charm\\nof bygone days lingers in them all, and still clings to its old walls\\nand bridges.\\n\\nThe Cathedral, with an incomplete fa\\u00e7ade, was not finished till 1754. It\\nis a vast, ugly structure of brick with a campanile and dome. The\\nwhitewashed interior possesses no redeeming feature; unless it be a\\nrather pleasing course of grey marble that runs round on a level with\\nthe capitals of the grey columns. A bust of Petrarch, who was a canon\\nhere, and some beautiful twelfth-century MSS. with exquisite miniatures\\nin the sacristy, are the most interesting things it contains. If there\\nis but little in the Cathedral worthy of notice there is much in the\\nother churches of Padua.\\n\\n \\n\\nSta Giustiana is a very fine building of the sixteenth century,\\ncommenced from designs by Padre Girolamo da Brescia and finished fifty\\nyears later by Andrea Morone. All its altars are decorated with scrolls\\nand floral patterns, in the inlaid marble work for which Italy has been\\nfamous for many generations.\\n\\nThe church of S. Agostino degli Eremitani is a solemn building of a\\nsingle nave three hundred feet in length, which was constructed at the\\nlatter end of the thirteenth century. Its sacristy is used by the\\nstudents of the university as their chapel, and many memorials of the\\nmost famous among them cover its walls. The tombs the church contains\\nare very interesting. One with a magnificent canopy is of the fifth Lord\\nof Padua, Jacopo di Carrara, a friend of Petrarch's, while other members\\nof this extinct family lie buried in the church. The Carraras were Lords\\nof Padua for many generations; the last of the great race with his two\\nsons held the city in 1405 against the Venetians, but famine so reduced\\nthe garrison that they surrendered themselves to the besiegers and were\\nconveyed prisoners to Venice. The Council of Ten decreed that they\\nshould be strangled in their cells, and a member of the noble Venetian\\nfamily of Priuli performed this disgraceful murder in the dungeons of\\nthe Doge's palace.\\n\\nSta Maria dell' Arena, or the church of the Madonna of the Arena,\\nstands practically in what was the Roman Amphitheatre. About the year\\n1306, a certain Enrico Scrovengo, who was owner of the Arena and\\nadjacent land, built within its precincts a chapel of the Annunciation,\\nknown as Sta Maria dell' Arena. Giotto was working in Padua at the time,\\nand Enrico recognising his talent employed him to build and decorate the\\nlittle chapel. It consists of a single nave with a Gothic apse, and tiny\\nsacristy in which is a monument to the founder, whose tomb is behind the\\naltar. It is not the province of this book to deal with the pictorial\\nart of the country, but Giotto's frescoes which cover the walls of this\\nlittle church stand far above all else -- not excepting Fra Angelico's\\nbeautiful decorations in the monastic cells of S. Marco at Florence -- in\\nthe deep piety and tender expression of intense religious feeling they\\nportray.\\n\\nThe greatest church that Padua possesses is the huge building dedicated\\nto S. Antonio -- \\\"il Santo,\\\" as he is called by the Padovanese. This\\nenormous fabric of marble and brick, stands facing a wide open piazza on\\ntwo sides of which are low houses -- houses of three storeys are very rare\\nin the older parts of the city. Opposite the fa\\u00e7ade is Donatello's grand\\nequestrian statue of Erasmo da Narni, or Gattamelata, bearing his name,\\n\\\"Opus Donatelli Flor.\\\" In the piazza is the Scuoio del Santo and the\\nlittle church of San Giorgio, the sepulchral chapel of the Sograna\\nfamily; close by which is the tomb of Rolando Piazzola with a fine\\nGothic canopy.\\n\\nThe seven domes of S. Antonio cluster round a heavy central spire, and\\ntwo beautiful bell-towers rise elegantly to a height above; from\\nwherever one sees the church, these domes and spires compose and \\\"pile\\\"\\nwell. Il Santo died in 1231, and Padua decided to erect a suitable\\nbuilding to hold his sacred remains. Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano was requisitioned\\nfor the task, but was not given a free hand. He was informed that he\\nmust follow the fashion of the day and produce a real Gothic edifice.\\nHis failure to carry out these instructions can be best seen in the\\nfa\\u00e7ade, where the three portals are very poor; nevertheless, and despite\\nhis leanings towards other styles, he was able to introduce something of\\nthe Gothic in his bell-towers, in the open galleries round the exterior\\nof the apse, and the arcading of the west front, with a mixed result\\nthat has produced a really stupendous church. The best decoration of the\\nexterior is contained in the three west doors of bronze, which are\\nexceedingly good.\\n\\nThe fine interior is most impressive, but what the result will be when\\nthe present scheme of decoration, already begun in the choir and apse,\\nis carried out, it is difficult to say. The chapel of Il Santo is half\\nway up the north aisle. Lights burn day and night before the altar,\\nbeneath which repose the saint's remains. Four fine columns support the\\nsomewhat heavy frieze of the great Renaissance screen by Sansovino,\\nwhich separates it from the aisle. Two of these columns have a charming\\nidea in their capitals, where little sea-horses take the place of the\\nacanthus leaf. The screen is terminated by two very beautiful pilasters\\nadorned with exquisite arabesques. The interior of this interesting\\nchapel is lined with nine reliefs, one of which, by Sansovino, is rather\\ncurious and certainly very gruesome. The sculptor has represented a\\nsuicide with a gaping crowd of women surrounding him in his\\nself-inflicted death agonies. Two enormous silver candlesticks, partly\\nof Gothic and partly Renaissance design, stand at the foot of the steps\\nof the altar, and bronze figures and silver angels are placed upon the\\nbalustrade. In the vestibule between this chapel and the next hang\\nhundreds of votive offerings of all descriptions, forming a museum of\\nthe tangible homage paid to the saint by his devotees. The next chapel\\nis the only part left of an ancient fabric which stood here long before\\nthe good Padovanese raised the present magnificent church as a memorial\\nof their venerated saint.\\n\\nIn the south aisle, opposite to and corresponding with Il Santo's\\nchapel, is one dedicated to S. Felix, which is fronted by a good screen\\ndecorated with an effective fish-scale pattern of Verona marble. It\\ncontains a good altar, placed high above a flight of steps, and some\\ninteresting fourteenth-century frescoes. A thick coating of paint quite\\nspoils the well-carved Gothic stalls, and it is to be hoped that when\\nthe scheme of decoration reaches this chapel these fine stalls will be\\nscraped and then left in their pristine state. In another chapel are the\\ntombs of Gattamelata and his son; these and two monuments designed by\\nSanmicheli on two of the piers of the nave are the best in the church.\\n\\nThe presbytery is cut off from the nave by a low balustrade, in the\\ncentre of which, rising in a bold sweep, is a very fine bronze gate. The\\nHigh Altar, impressively placed at the top of some steps, has eight\\nsplendid panels containing bas-reliefs by Donatello. The master was also\\nresponsible for the fine group of the Madonna and Saints, as well as the\\nhuge crucifix, which are placed above it. The magnificent bronze\\ncandelabrum, which stands to the left of the altar, is twelve feet high.\\nIts maker, Andrea Riccio, spent ten years over the work before he\\nconsidered it fit to leave his studio. The figures at the base are\\nsymbolical of Music, History, Destiny, and Astrology, forming with\\nthose above, a paschal candlestick that is one of the finest pieces of\\nbronze work in any church in the country. The sanctuary beyond the apse\\nwas an addition of the year 1693, and occupies the most eastern dome\\nseen in the illustration. Great gilded sliding doors hide a wonderful\\nexample of fifteenth-century goldsmith's work, a casket with Il Santo's\\ntongue inside, and many other sacred relics, as well as Gattamelata's\\nmarshal's baton. The great doors are surrounded by work of the late\\nseventeenth century, an example of the bad taste and very low ebb\\necclesiastical art had sunk to at that period. Cherubs and nude female\\nfigures playing stringed instruments -- angels apparently -- circle round S.\\nAntonio, who is borne aloft by other nudes. The extravagance of the\\nwhole thing is a jarring note amongst much that is extremely fine.\\n\\nThe monks of the brotherhood of S. Antonio still inhabit the conventual\\nbuildings attached to the church, and their dark-robed figures pass\\nsilently to and fro in the cloistered courts of the monastery. The walls\\nof these three courts are lined with fine tombs and memorial slabs, and\\nit was from one of these cloisters the illustration was taken. A great\\nmagnolia tree grows on the well-kept grass which covers the ground like\\ngreen velvet. No sound from the outside world penetrated this\\nsequestered nook. The only note to break the silence was the drowsy\\nhum from a voice at prayer in one of the little green-shuttered rooms\\nabove, and the occasional twittering of a canary in its cage. One worked\\nundisturbed at those domes and towers which compose so well and seem to\\nreach up to the very heavens.\\n\\n \\n\\nPadua's university was founded in 1221 by the Emperor Frederick II. on\\nthe site of the Inn of the Ox, and is still called il B\\u00f2. Its handsome\\ncourtyard, attributed to Palladio, is adorned with armorial bearings of\\ndistinguished alumni . At the head of the great staircase is a statue\\nto Elena Piscopia, a poetess, musician, and fluent linguist; she\\nreceived a doctor's degree and died a spinster in 1684. The anatomical\\ntheatre is the oldest in Europe. Among other famous men connected with\\nil B\\u00f2 the names of Baldus, who taught law, and Galileo, who expounded\\nmathematics, must be mentioned.\\n\\nPadua also possesses the oldest Botanical Gardens in Europe, which were\\ninstituted by the Venetian Senate in 1543. Many of the exotics which\\ngrow now all over Europe were first established here, brought from the\\nEast by Venetian traders, and the botanist can spend many interesting\\nhours in this well cared for and shady retreat.\\n\\nA vast building with a remarkable history occupies one whole side of the\\nmarket square. A much-travelled architect and engineer, Fra Giovanni,\\nvisited Padua in the fourteenth century, bringing with him drawings of\\nan Indian palace; these so pleased the Padovanese that he was asked to\\nconstruct a roof to their great hall, the three divisions of which had\\nbeen destroyed by fire. Fra Giovanni set to work, and his vaulted wooden\\nceiling, one of the largest in Europe, stands covering the principal\\nchamber of the Palazzo della Ragione, though the roof above was renewed\\nin 1857. The paintings on the walls of this magnificent room have by\\ndegrees replaced a series of frescoes by Giotto. They are mostly\\nmystical and symbolical, the best among them being those representing\\nJustice and Prudence. The wooden horse which stands in the hall is\\nsupposed to have been the model for Donatello's bronze horse on which\\nGattamelata is seated in the famous equestrian statue outside S.\\nAntonio. The fine loggia on the ground floor of the palazzo is of\\nlater date than the original parts of the building, which were designed\\nby Pietro Cozzo and constructed in the years 1172 to 1219. In a street\\nnot far off is another beautiful building, the early-Renaissance Loggia\\ndel Consiglio, with its fine stairway and open arcade. In front of this\\nis an antique column with the Lion of S. Mark, the sign that the city at\\none time belonged to the Republic of Venice. Many other houses in this\\nquaint old town are of great interest, and the windings of its streams\\nas they meander past rose-covered walls and low roofs, with perhaps a\\ntapering campanile or a dome towering above, afford a rare field for\\nendeavours with the pencil and brush.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVENICE\\n\\n\\nVenice, which has no counterpart in the world, is a city of all others\\nin which one can linger on in a dream taking no count of time. The days\\nrun into weeks, these spread themselves into months, and it becomes more\\nand more difficult to tear oneself away from the entrancing \\\"Mistress of\\nthe Seas,\\\" from her Cathedral and all her other marvellous buildings;\\nfrom her seductive gondolas and silent canals; from her picture\\ngalleries, and alas! from the fragrant coffee we sip idling away the\\ntime under the colonnade outside Florian's in the Piazza.\\n\\nWell, the seductive cup is drained and while our cigarette is alight let\\nus look round. Directly opposite to us, on the north side of this grand\\nsquare, stretches the long colonnade of the Procuratie Vecchie, built\\nearly in the sixteenth century as a habitation for the procurators of S.\\nMark. It is one of the best examples of early Renaissance architecture\\nin Italy; nobler, simpler than the Procuratie Nuove where we sit, which\\nwas built in the last quarter of the same century. An arcaded building\\nin the classical style erected by Napoleon in 1810 connects the western\\nextremities of the two Procuratie. It is a pity that this great\\nRenaissance Piazza should be completed by an inferior bit of modern work\\ninstead of such a brilliant gem of the Renaissance style as Sansovino's\\nLibreria Vecchia -- at present invisible to us round the corner. To this\\nbuilding, which faces the Doge's Palace, no higher tribute could be\\ngiven than to say that its perfection fairly distracts the admiration of\\nthe onlooker from the wonderful Gothic pile before it.\\n\\nBut all this is Hamlet without the Prince. It is time to leave the\\nshadow of the arches, to step out into the open, and to surrender\\nourselves to the spell of the great church which draws one with an\\nirresistible fascination from the first moment we set foot in the\\nPiazza. S. Mark's rises bounding the vision at the eastern end of the\\ngreat square with its gorgeous fa\\u00e7ade and cool grey domes. So rich is\\nthe colouring and so strange the outline that one wonders almost whether\\narchitecture has not passed here into the sister art of painting.\\n\\n \\n\\nYes, there stands a building surpassingly fascinating, unique and\\noutside all comparison with any other church in the country. Planned as\\na Greek Cross, like S. Sophia at Constantinople, it is reminiscent of\\nthe East far more than any building in the peninsula, or even in\\nSicily where some with direct Arab influence still exist. The great\\ntraders of Venice who lavished their wealth on its decoration, and whose\\nevery homeward bound ship brought back from the Orient a choice column,\\na rare piece of marble, or some such thing as a contribution towards its\\nmaking, helped to raise it bit by bit until the wonderful church grew to\\nbe what we find it to-day, the most seductive ecclesiastical fabric in\\nItaly.\\n\\nIt was not until the year 1807 that S. Mark's became the Cathedral\\nchurch of Venice. Before this date the Patriarchal seat was the church\\nof S. Pietro di Castello, and S. Mark's simply the chapel attached to\\nthe Doge's Palace. In 828 the body of the Evangelist, stolen from\\nAlexandria, was brought to Venice and S. Theodore the tutelary saint\\ndeposed to make way for a more important patron. S. Mark's remains were\\nthen placed in a church which was destroyed by fire in 976. The\\nfollowing year saw the first stone laid of a building which is perhaps\\nthe most interesting in Christendom; but it was not until eighty years\\nhad passed that the walls were finished, and seventy more gone by before\\nit was consecrated. The interior sustaining walls are brick, and are\\nlined with marble or covered with mosaics and decorated with every sort\\nof inlay. The tout ensemble of this is an extraordinarily harmonious\\nmixture of styles which compels unceasing admiration.\\n\\nStanding at the west end of the Piazza one sees, almost stretching\\nacross the further side, a marvellous fa\\u00e7ade of deep shadowed arches;\\nthe tympanums seem to sparkle with jewels; the arches are supported by\\nwhat appears to be a forest of columns, orderly in rank, receding into\\nthe shadow. Above, to give quality to this shade, is a flat surface that\\nruns from end to end of the fa\\u00e7ade, broken by a central semicircular\\nwindow, and crowned with Gothic turrets, crocketed finials and angels\\nwith wings outspread. Then, surmounting all are five wondrous domes,\\nOriental in themselves, so overpoweringly Oriental that the eye, unable\\nat this distance to discriminate, telegraphs to the brain the magic\\nwords -- \\\"The East!\\\" Spoils from the East, from Greece, from Syria, from\\nEgypt; mosaics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, bronze horses\\nof Roman origin, Gothic saints under canopied turrets, flag poles with\\nthe crimson banner and golden Lion of S. Mark, all arranged without\\ndisorder, but all succumbing to the majesty of the marvellous domes.\\nMore Eastern than European is the Venetian's love of colour, and this is\\nthe note most deeply impressed on the mind with regard to S.\\nMark's -- five grey domes, a foil to the brilliant mosaics and many-hued\\nmarble columns and walls below, but blending with them so subtly that\\nthe whole is one gorgeous chromatic scale.\\n\\nThe effect of the blazing sun pouring down on the fa\\u00e7ade at midday,\\ncasting deep shadows under the arches, is very fine. Again, in the\\nevening when the domes are alight with the last rays of the dying orb\\nand the great Piazza is in cool shade, the glories of the wonderful\\nfabric assume a dramatic effect which becomes almost tragic as the light\\ndisappears and everything subsides into a monotone. Colour begets more\\nsubtlety in grey weather; every note that might jar on the eye is then\\ndiffused among the quieter tones around, and for this reason the pearly\\nsky of a grey day was chosen to depict S. Mark's. The great campanile \\nwhich fell to the ground on July 14, 1902, is now in course of\\nre-erection. For some years past the necessary but hideous hoarding at\\nits base has interfered with the beauty of the Piazza. The illustration\\ndoes not show this but depicts the length of the fa\\u00e7ade, with the\\nbeautiful Porta della Carta and corner of the Doge's Palace beyond.\\n\\nThe lowest portion of the fa\\u00e7ade is formed as a vestibule with seven\\narches, the last one of which at each end is open through. All the\\ncolumns and their capitals (spoils from the East) are of much older date\\nthan the building. Very few of these capitals fit the abacus on which\\nthey rest; most of them are exquisitely carved with foliage free from\\nall imagery. The central arch is larger than the others. Under it is a\\ngrand door of forty-eight bronze panels inlaid with silver. The\\nworkmanship of the other doors which flank this is also very fine. The\\nintricate Byzantine carving above these forms a scheme of decoration\\nwherein figures, birds, beasts and arabesques run in a perfect riot of\\nfanciful design. The vaulting of the vestibule is covered with mosaics\\nof different periods. Those of the twelfth century are concerned with\\nthe Creation of the Firmament and the Creation of Life; the story of\\nAdam and Eve continued on to the Deluge and Noah; the tragedy of Cain\\nand Abel; Joseph's dream, Pharaoh and the story of Moses. The general\\nscheme throughout is of white figures, mostly nude, on a green ground.\\nAlthough not in any way comparable to the earlier mosaics at Ravenna,\\nthese are far better in style and true feeling for the enrichment of a\\nflat surface than those of later date in the lunettes above the fa\\u00e7ade\\narches. Here the raison d'\\u00eatre of mosaic has been made subservient to\\nan attempt to imitate the shades and gradations of an oil painting. The\\nmost important of these later mosaics is that which was executed from a\\ndesign by Titian by the brothers Zuccati in the sixteenth century,\\nwherein S. Mark appears in pontifical robes. It is above the centre\\ndoor. On the pavement beneath is a red and white lozenge of marble\\nmarking the spot where Pope Alexander III. and Barbarossa were\\nreconciled in July 1177, through the intervention of the Venetian\\nRepublic. Many inscribed slabs of marble bearing legends in Greek and\\nSyriac, and Roman bas-reliefs, are let into the walls of the vestibule,\\nevidence of offerings towards the building of the fabric. All the\\narchivolts of the five large arches are decorated with symbolic\\ncarvings; the most interesting being that of the main entrance, where a\\ncharmingly quaint story illustrative of peasant life in the twelve\\nmonths of the year tells in a realistic way the labours of those who\\ntill the soil. February with a little figure sitting at a fire warming\\nhis hands is particularly na\\u00efve.\\n\\nOn the south, S. Mark's joins the Doge's Palace by means of the Porta\\ndella Carta. At the base of a column which stands in an angle of the\\nwall are four porphyry figures of knights in chain mail with arms round\\none another's necks. This group is supposed to have come from Acre.\\nDetached from the main building, and not far from its south-west corner,\\nare two short rectangular columns with Greek inscriptions. They were\\nbrought from the church of S. Saba at Ptolemais in 1256. Amongst other\\ninteresting spoils there is a slab let into the north wall on which\\nCeres, holding a torch in each hand, appears drawn in a chariot by two\\ndragons. It seems to be a very early Persian work. But the best known,\\nand certainly the finest gift the exterior of the building can boast, is\\nthat of the four bronze horses which stand over the principal entrance.\\nSent from Constantinople in 1204 by order of the Doge Dandolo as part of\\nthe spoils of victory when that city fell to the arms of the Venetians\\nin the fourth Crusade, these horses at one time adorned the triumphal\\narch of Nero in Rome. Both Domitian and Trajan transferred them in turn\\nto arches of their own; and Constantine conveyed them across the seas to\\nhis new capital in the East, where he also put them up over an arch. In\\n1797, when the Republic of Venice was no more, Napoleon took these\\nalready much-travelled horses from S. Mark's fa\\u00e7ade to Paris and placed\\nthem on the top of the Arc du Carrousel. After the peace in 1815 the\\nAustrian Emperor, Francis I. caused them to be returned to their former\\nposition, and there they remain to-day.\\n\\nThree doors open into the cathedral from the vestibule, and two on the\\nnorth side. The interior strikes one at first as being very dark; but\\nwhen the eye becomes accustomed to the half-light and is familiar with\\neverything within, this wears off, and the senses are rather soothed\\nthan otherwise by the mystic gloom. Indeed, it is a great relief to\\nfind oneself inside out of the glare of the Piazza, and, seated in a\\ncorner perhaps, quietly contemplating the grand mosaics which cover the\\nvaulting from end to end. It is quite impossible to describe these\\nadequately in a short chapter which deals with other things as well, but\\nnoting them in guide-book fashion one observes that those in the aisles\\non either side of the main entrance depict the Acts and Miracles of the\\nApostles. On the vaulting of the dome which forms, so to speak, the foot\\nof the Greek cross, is the Descent of the Holy Ghost. The great central\\ndome is covered by twelfth-century mosaics of the Ascension, and the\\nvault between this and the first dome with Christ's Passion and\\nResurrection. The vaulting of the two domes which compose the arms of\\nthe cross is decorated by work of later date; that on the north with the\\nhistory of S. John, and that on the south with the saints. The chapel of\\nS. John which is in the north transept was converted in the seventeenth\\ncentury into one dedicated to the Miraculous Virgin of Constantinople.\\nIn the south transept also a rededication has taken place; the chapel of\\nS. Leonard being turned into that of the Holy Sacrament.\\n\\nBehind the gorgeous marble screen which divides the presbytery from the\\nbody of the church the high altar rises beneath a canopy of verde\\nantico borne by four columns. Two of these columns are eleventh century\\nand are elaborately carved in courses of innumerable figures. They came\\nfrom Pola when Venice subdued Istria, and are much more interesting than\\nthe other two of a later date; the remains of S. Mark rest within this\\nmagnificent shrine. On the screen itself stand the Evangelist, the\\ntwelve Apostles, and Mary.\\n\\nAt the back of the high altar is the Pala d'Oro, the greatest treasure\\nthe cathedral possesses, and the most celebrated golden altarpiece in\\nexistence. The upper part came from Constantinople in 976, the lower\\nabout the middle of the fourteenth century. It is composed of\\neighty-three panels of Greek and Byzantine design filled with enamelled\\nfigures, studded with uncut gems and precious stones, and covered with\\nGreek and Latin inscriptions. More gorgeous than that of S. Ambrogio in\\nMilan, this magnificent piece of goldsmith's art glitters and sparkles\\nin a wonderful manner when lit up by the candles used at high mass, and\\nis without doubt the most splendid ecclesiastical treasure in Italy.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe fifth or eastern dome which is over the presbytery is covered with\\nmosaics representing Christ and the Prophets, and one that is hardly\\nvisible of S. Mark is on the walls of the east end. The great figure of\\nChrist faces the church and in its simplicity is very impressive.\\n\\nThe gallery, which is where the triforium would be in a Gothic building,\\nruns round the whole cathedral and is pierced on its inner side only.\\nThe walls at the back and above are decorated with more mosaic work\\ndealing with acts of martyrdom, and the Translation and Recovery of the\\nBody of the Lord. When stray beams of sunlight find their way through\\nthe openings in the domes and pass along the gold background, lighting\\nup in odd places small portions of these wonderful tesser\\u00e6 pictures,\\nthe effect is very beautiful. All the angles of this mosaic work are\\nrounded off and the travelling rays glinting first on one golden corner,\\nthen on another, are strangely attractive to eyes accustomed to the\\ngreater architectural severity of a northern clime. The well-chosen\\nslabs that line the lower portions of the cathedral walls have taken to\\nthemselves a sombre, dusky hue, a pale velvety brown, but there can be\\nno doubt that in their pristine state they realised in their splendour\\nthe Venetian's love of colour.\\n\\nThe strange pulpit, which with part of the rood screen seen in the\\nillustration stands to the north of the steps leading into the\\npresbytery, is arranged in a double tier, and is entered by a double\\nwinding stair from the vestibule of the Capella de S. Pietro. Its\\ncurious domed sounding-board is very reminiscent of the East. Mention\\nhas already been made of the chapels of the Miraculous Virgin and S.\\nLeonard. That dedicated to S. Peter is behind this pulpit on the north\\nside of the presbytery. It has a door leading out into the piazza. The\\ncorresponding chapel to the south is dedicated to S. Clement. At the end\\nof the north transept is another to S. Isidore -- a dark, solemn little\\nplace. The sacristy is beyond the chapel of S. Peter at the back of the\\npresbytery. It is a fine apartment with mosaics from designs by Titian\\nand his pupils, which may be studied as a good example of Renaissance\\ndecoration in tesser\\u00e6 . Sansovino, who executed the beautiful door, is\\nsaid to have had it in hand for twenty years.\\n\\nThe baptistery is entered from the south aisle, and with the adjoining\\nCappella Zeno is one of the most interesting parts of S. Mark's. In the\\nformer is the monument and sarcophagus of Doge Andrea Dandolo, who died\\nin 1354. It is a grand specimen of the sculpture of the age. The\\nrecumbent figure of the Doge, who was the last to be buried in S.\\nMark's, is very serene in its realisation of the Last Sleep. All the\\nmosaics the chamber contains were given and paid for by Andrea. Most of\\nthem naturally relate to the Holy Rite. The font is very ancient, and\\nhas a fine bronze cover designed by Sansovino and surmounted by a\\nstatuette of S. John the Baptist. A very beautiful low relief of four\\ncrossed swords which compose a cross, with birds beneath, is let into\\none of the walls. On the vaulted roof of the Cappella Zeno, the life of\\nthe Evangelist, whose body at first rested here, is well depicted in a\\nseries of mosaics. The centre of the chapel is occupied by the tomb of\\nCardinal Zeno, who left the bulk of his immense fortune to S. Mark's.\\nThe altar stands under a bronze canopy covering figures of Our Lady (who\\nwears a gilded shoe), S. Peter, and S. John the Baptist. The legend runs\\nthat the Virgin gave her bronze shoe once to a poor votary and it was\\nimmediately turned into gold. From this incident the chapel, which\\nbecame the Cardinal's Mausoleum, is also known as that of the Madonna\\ndella Scarpa.\\n\\nVenice possesses nearly seventy churches, but of these only the two most\\ncelebrated can be mentioned in this chapter. They are SS. Giovanni e\\nPaolo, and the Frari. The former had its origin in the great preaching\\nOrder of S. Dominic, and the latter in that of S. Francis. These saints,\\nbound by vows of poverty, went forth preaching humility, and so great a\\nmeed of success did they attain, that we find throughout the country, as\\na result of their crusade, huge churches like these built to hold large\\ncongregations. In Venice both Orders had their following among different\\npatrician families, who were mainly responsible for the monetary\\nassistance the Orders received, and who therefore acquired a sort of\\nprescriptive right to burial space within the holy walls they had helped\\nto raise. For this reason the tombs we find in SS. Giovanni e Paolo and\\nthe Frari are not only an epitome of the rulers of Venice, but in them\\ncan be traced from the earliest Gothic the different styles of Venetian\\ndecorative art as exemplified in her sepulchral monuments.\\n\\nSS. Giovanni e Paolo is a fine brick building of early Italian Gothic,\\nwhich was commenced in 1246 and finished in 1390. Its length is three\\nhundred and thirty feet, its width at the transepts one hundred and\\nforty-three, and in the nave ninety-one feet. From this it will be seen\\nthat the transepts are short. The spacious nave has five bays, the\\narches of which are supported by single columns of grey stone with\\nsimple floral capitals. The vaulting, as is usual in Italian Gothic, is\\nlow. The galleried triforium has small outlets into the church, and a\\nclerestory of pointed lights in groups of three has taken the place of\\nmuch larger single windows. The aisles are narrow. The apsidal choir is\\narchitecturally very striking. From a few feet above the floor rise the\\nlong narrow windows of the apse reaching up beyond the base of the\\nvaulting and giving an idea of immense height. The glass they contain\\nis, however, very crude; and, unfortunately, a terrible pink wash covers\\nthe walls, so pink that the beauty of the architectural features is\\nconsiderably marred. The choice of material and the selection of colour\\nhas more to do with the success or failure of a building than is\\ngenerally realised. The transepts, nave, and aisles are coloured grey,\\nand harmonise with the stone columns mentioned above, and with the\\nmonuments of faintly tinted marble which crowd the walls of the aisles.\\n\\nAmong the most notable tombs are those of the Mocenigo family, a family\\nwhich possessed the whole of the west wall of the church, and whose\\nmonuments almost cover it. Of the three equestrian tombs that are in the\\nchurch, pride of place must be given to the one put there to Niccolo\\nOrsini, who commanded the Republic's forces in the war against the\\nLeague of Cambray. The gilded group of the general and his horse above\\nthe sarcophagus is full of life and vigour. The simple but very\\nbeautiful tomb of Paolo Loudan, on which his recumbent figure in full\\nchain mail lies stretched, is a fine work of the middle of the\\nfourteenth century.\\n\\nThe grand monument to Andrea Vendramin, who died in 1478, and who was\\nthe first of the new nobility to be elevated to the position of\\nsovereign, is the most refined example of a Renaissance tomb in Venice.\\nThe Doge lies, with face turned towards the spectator, on a couch\\nsupported by eagles. Behind him are pages and other attendants. The\\ncarving and arabesques of the canopy and its supports, into which notes\\nsymbolical of naval power are crowded, though extremely intricate, are\\nvery pure in style. In the lunette beneath the arch kneels the Doge, who\\nis being recommended to Our Lady by S. Mark. Opposite to this beautiful\\ntomb is the Gothic memorial to Doge Michele Morosini, who died in 1382.\\nThe background of the central portion is a good mosaic of the\\nCrucifixion, in front of which the aquiline features of the recumbent\\nDuke are very prominent. The niches on either side are filled with\\nfigures of different saints, and the whole is surmounted by S. Michael\\nwith the Dragon.\\n\\nThe exterior of the church, especially the apse, which rises without a\\nsingle buttress, is very impressive. A good Gothic portal occupies the\\ncentre of the unfinished west fa\\u00e7ade, which is flanked by\\nthirteenth-century sarcophagi let into niches in the walls. Close by,\\nand occupying one side of the Campo in which the church stands, is the\\nScuola di S. Marco. This building, now a hospital, was erected in 1485\\nby Martino Lombardi, and is noteworthy for the curiously conceived\\nfa\\u00e7ade that faces the square. This is composed of richly coloured marble\\ndivided into panels, on which in low relief different buildings are seen\\nin acute perspective. They recall the same sort of decoration which\\nprevails in the frescoes at Pompeii, but so cleverly did Lombardi\\narrange his scheme that their absolute falsity in no way detracts from\\nthe general design of the building.\\n\\nIn front of the fa\\u00e7ade stands the magnificent equestrian statue to that\\nprince of condottieri whose mausoleum at Bergamo has already been\\nmentioned, Bartolommeo Colleoni. A man amongst men, stern, defiant and\\nresourceful, his grand figure embodies all that a leader in troublous\\ntimes should be. Firmly gripping his saddle, he sits his horse with head\\nthrown back and a face which betokens the masterful haughtiness of the\\nman. The group was designed by Leonardo da Vinci's master, Andrea\\nVerrocchio, and finished by Alessandro Leopardi. It vies with\\nDonatello's equestrian group of Gattamelata at Padua in being perhaps\\nthe best Italian Renaissance statue extant.\\n\\nThe Frari is a church which grew out of the accumulated funds of the\\nFranciscans, whose enormous monastery, now holding the municipal\\narchives, adjoins it. This great church was commenced in 1250 and\\nfinished in 1338, and contains the monuments and tombs of some of the\\ncity's rulers, as well as many of the Venetian nobility who in bygone\\ndays made their names famous in its annals. The west fa\\u00e7ade has a simple\\nGothic doorway and four round windows, one of which, larger than the\\nothers, is above the figure of Christ that occupies the apex of the\\narch. Like SS. Giovanni e Paolo the east end is architecturally the most\\ninteresting part of the fabric. Two flights of lofty windows with\\nexceedingly good tracery admit light into the apse. This has been\\ncontinued south by later additions as far as the wall of the transept.\\nThe transept being thus enlarged has four apsidal chambers that form a\\npleasing sequence to the big eastern apse. The exterior of the church,\\nwhen viewed from the little Campo S. Rocco outside the east end,\\ncomposes extremely well. The four small apses lead up to the big one,\\nbehind which and beyond the roof line one sees the great Campanile\\nrising over the north transept. The Frari is built of brick with a\\nsimple decorative feature in the form of a course of Venetian Gothic at\\nthe top.\\n\\nOwing to subsidence of the foundations the interior is now undergoing\\nextensive repair. The nave is very lofty, with single columns of grey\\nstone that have floral capitals. The groining ribs of the vault are of\\nred brick and the arches of the bays are grey stone. Two of the nave\\ncolumns are massively constructed of brick, and form with the brick\\nwalls of the aisles and the grey colour of the stone a very charming\\nscheme. The choir occupies the last two bays of the nave, and as is the\\ncase in the cathedrals of Spain, is cut off from the body of the church\\nby a rood screen. The portion of this which is in the nave is debased\\nRenaissance, but that in the aisles is earlier and much better. The\\nchoir stalls are very finely carved and decorated with superb intarsia \\nwork. The little door by which the canons enter the choir is\\nparticularly good in this respect, with a beauty much enhanced by the\\ndesign on the doorposts. Round these cling vines and grape clusters. The\\nclerestory consists of round windows with double lights, but there is no\\ntriforium. Among the most interesting monuments are those erected to\\nBeato Pacifico, the Franciscan architect of the church, which is in the\\nsouth transept, and one to Titian in the south aisle. His masterpiece of\\nthe Assumption, now in the Accademia delle Belle Arti, was painted for\\nthe Frari.\\n\\nThe domestic architecture of Venice is far more interesting than that\\nwith which we have just dealt. Peculiar to Venetia, it is the outcome\\nof that period when, the city's trade being well established in\\nnorthern climes, new ideas and fashions travelled back from countries\\nover the great mountain chain and began to commingle with the older\\ntraditions of the East. Not only on the Grand Canal, but in many of the\\nquiet byways of the Silent City, one comes across beautiful examples of\\nthat entrancing style of fa\\u00e7ade, the Venetian Gothic.\\n\\nAs the gondola glides swiftly over the waters of the great highway of\\nVenice there comes into sight a group of palaces which occupies the only\\nreal angle of the Grand Canal. This group is formed of the celebrated\\nhouses built by the Foscari and Giustiniani families, and is somewhat in\\nthe style of the Doge's Palace, the first-named being contemporary with\\nit. The flat brick fa\\u00e7ades are broken by rows of elegant windows, some\\nwith, some without balconies. The deeply-recessed arcading of the\\ncentral lights of the first and second storeys gives just the right\\namount of shade to an otherwise flat surface, which the windows above\\nand at either side only slightly relieve. A course of white marble\\nedging and heavy foundations of enormous blocks of the same give\\nsolidity, and most beautifully frame the pale-red brick of which the\\nVenetians were so fond. Rows of pali , or posts, painted with the\\ncolours of the owner, serve as a dock for waiting gondolas. The\\nwater of the canal, never quiescent, is a puzzle for the painter who\\nwould study reflections. The tide ebbs and flows on the great highway,\\nthe convenient but hideous steamboat rushes by, gondolas groan and creak\\nagainst their moorings, and a kaleidoscope of ever-changing shapes and\\ncolours well-nigh drives him to despair.\\n\\n \\n\\nFurther up the Grand Canal is a very ornate palace, the Ca d'Oro, with\\nangles softened by three twisted columns instead of the more usual one\\nin this type of building. Its fa\\u00e7ade was designed by Giovanni and\\nBartolommeo Buon, who built the Piazzetta in front of the Doge's Palace.\\nAt one time it was entirely covered with gilt -- hence the name. Down near\\nthe Salute, where the canal opens out to the sea, are the Palazzo da\\nMula and the fascinating little Palazzo Contarini-Fasan, with its lovely\\ntraceried balconies. These are all Venetian Gothic. Of other styles the\\nByzantine Palazzi, da Mosto and Loudan, the latter Byron's Venetian\\nhome, and the Renaissance Palazzi, Rezzonico, where Browning lived,\\nCamerlanghi, Manzoni, with a frieze of eagles, Pesaro, and Dario, with\\nplaques of coloured marble on its fa\\u00e7ade, are the most celebrated. Most\\nof them are cracking and bulging, and more than one owes its present\\nexistence to the iron clamps which hold it together. It is much to be\\nfeared that the utilitarian steamboat and ever-increasing motor-boat\\ntraffic will sooner or later be responsible for the destruction of many\\na beautiful building, the foundations of which were never intended to\\nwithstand the strain of the great extra wash it creates.\\n\\nIn a safer position than most is the Doge's Palace, that magnificent\\nconstruction which almost distracts attention from S. Mark's by its\\nside.\\n\\nThe first building to be constructed for the rulers of Venice stood on\\nthe site of the Palace and was erected in 813. Fire subsequently\\ndestroyed it and also the edifice which replaced the smoking ruins. The\\npresent building was commenced in 1301 and save for the outer walls was\\nalmost gutted in 1574 and 1577. Palladio, the foremost architect of the\\nday, contended that it would be dangerous to attempt any reconstruction\\nunless these walls were demolished, and it speaks volumes for the good\\ntaste of the Senate that his scheme for pulling them down and putting up\\nanother palace in his own hard classic style was not adopted. The\\nexterior as we see it is almost entirely due to the talented family of\\nBuon -- Giovanni, the father, and his two sons, Pantaleone and\\nBartolommeo. It is, however, much to be regretted that while restoring\\nthe fa\\u00e7ades this celebrated family of tajapieri , or stonecutters, did\\nnot adhere to the level and beautiful design of the two windows which\\nescaped the fire at the east end of the fa\\u00e7ade that looks over the Riva\\ndegli Schiavoni out to sea. The short massive columns of the lower\\ncolonnade give an idea of immense strength to the great flat space\\nabove. The capitals of these stunted columns are extremely interesting.\\nThe Virtues and Vices find places amidst their foliage, as do the most\\nfamous of Rome's Emperors and Philosophers, the signs of the Zodiac and\\nmany other symbols. Twisted shafts, one of the types of Venetian Gothic,\\nterminate the three angles of the upper part of the two fa\\u00e7ades. Their\\nbases are composed of sculptured groups. The angle nearest to S. Mark's\\nhas the Archangel Michael with the Judgment of Solomon below him. The\\nnext, at the south-west corner, is a group of Adam and Eve with Gabriel\\nabove. In the last, Noah, drunk with wine, is being covered by two of\\nhis sons, and above them is S. Raphael with Tobias, who holds a fish.\\n\\nA noble window and pierced balcony of early fifteenth-century work\\noccupies the centre of the upper arcade which faces the sea. This\\nbeautiful window and marble balcony open out from the great Sala\\nMaggiore Consiglio. Above the moulding of the window is a figure of\\nJustice, and below in flanking niches are SS. Peter, Paul and Mark;\\nFaith, Hope and Charity; and the four Cardinal Virtues. A fine loggia,\\nwith cusped arches and quatrefoils above, runs round both the exposed\\nsides of the Palace. The plan of the building is an irregular square\\nwith a great courtyard inside. The courtyard is Renaissance, the east\\nside being a particularly good example of a period when the wealth of\\nVenice was lavished on her buildings.\\n\\nIn the north-east corner of this court and opposite to the Porta della\\nCarta, is the famous Scala dei Giganti, erected by Rizzio in 1483. At\\nthe head of this magnificent Staircase of the Giants, the Doges were\\ncrowned with the Cap of Authority. From it an open corridor runs right\\nand left. On the right the Scala d'Oro ascends to the second floor. Only\\nthose whose names were inscribed in the Libro d'Oro were permitted to\\nuse this stairway, which led to that portion of the Palace occupied by\\nthe Doges and their attendant nobles. The continuous suite of\\nmagnificent apartments through which the visitor wanders seem full of\\nemptiness and sadly want the stately figures and quaint dress, the\\nsonorous voices and courtly manners of the bygone age that once peopled\\nthem and made them live. The gorgeously gilded and coloured ceilings\\nbecome not only oppressive from their magnificence, but wearisome by\\ntheir repetition; and despite the great traditions that cling to the\\nPalace and the remembrance of the history made within these chambers, it\\nis with a sigh of relief that one steps out on to the balcony where\\nJustice holds the Scales above our head, and drinks in the balmy air\\nthat floats in over the lagoons keeping Venice pure and sweet.\\n\\n \\n\\nOutside on the Riva at the end of the Piazzetta are two columns of\\ngranite that were brought to Venice in 1180 by Doge Michiel. One came\\nfrom Syria, the other from Constantinople. On the capital of one is the\\nWinged Lion of S. Mark, the emblem of Venice's patron saint; an emblem\\nwhich is to be found in every city in the country that owned allegiance\\nto the Doge's rule. On the other is a figure of S. Theodore, who stands\\nover a crocodile. S. Theodore, it will be remembered, was the tutelary\\nsaint of Venice before his deposition on the arrival of S. Mark's body;\\nbut this statue was not put up on the monolith until the year 1329.\\nThese two great columns look across the water to the isle of S. Giorgio\\nMaggiore, where Palladio's great church stands in its chilly splendour.\\nBeyond are the lagoons and the open sea. The marble-paved landing-stage\\non which they stand is from one point of view the most interesting part\\nof Venice. On it her great traders and merchants gathered when the\\nlong-expected ships from the East came into sight; and as they swept\\nproudly up the channels and dropped anchor opposite, one can well\\nimagine the excitement of the thankful owners who would in a few minutes\\ngo on board and learn of the success or failure of the long voyage just\\nended.\\n\\nThe oldest part of Venice lies across the Rialto bridge, on the island\\nof Rivo Alto, where the fish and vegetable markets now are. As this\\nlittle town grew more prosperous a wooden bridge, replaced in 1588 by\\nthe present one, was built to connect Rivo Alto with the island\\nopposite; and by degrees the seventy-two islands on which the city is\\nbuilt became absorbed within her borders. It must never be forgotten\\nthat Venice, until connected with the mainland by a railway bridge,\\nalways faced the sea, which, as Grant Allen writes, was the front door.\\n\\nLong before the Venice of Rivo Alto came into being, there was a\\nflourishing little city not many miles away on the island of Torcello.\\nAt the time when Attila and his Huns descended on the Roman colony of\\nAquileia and wrought devastation throughout that flourishing outpost of\\nthe world's greatest city, many of the inhabitants, leaving their\\ndesolate homes to the mercy of the invader, fled to the swamps and\\nislands at the estuaries of the rivers Po, Adige, and Brenta. Amidst\\nthese dismal surroundings the greater number found refuge on the island\\nof Torcello. From Torcello the refugees in time pushed out to the\\nsurrounding islands, and an important station was established on Rivo\\nAlto. Thus began Venice; and from this little island grew that great\\nRepublic, the Mistress of the Seas, which down to the time of the French\\nRevolution had never seen a conquering host enter its waterways.\\n\\nAs early as 641 Torcello possessed a cathedral. This was rebuilt in 874,\\nand parts of the structure were later on incorporated into the building\\nwhich stands to-day just as it did when finished in the early eleventh\\ncentury by Bishop Orseolo. Its architectural interest lies in its being\\nan Italian church on strict Byzantine lines, and it is one of the\\nearliest examples of cultivated native art. Its exterior possesses the\\nsimplicity of all early work and stands up like a great barrack, with\\nits campanile a landmark for miles over the dreary waste of waters.\\nThe interior is very austere and cold. The bays on either side of the\\nnave separate it from the aisles. The columns that support the round\\narches are a light grey marble; the capitals, Corinthianized Byzantine.\\nThe clerestory lights, which are placed just under the roof, are on the\\nsouth side only, those on the north having been blocked up at some\\nremote period. The south aisle is lit by narrow round-headed windows,\\neach of which has a great marble shutter slab on the outside still\\nswinging in its marble socket -- a reminiscence of Ancient Rome, and one\\nthat exists in the Roman butchers' shops of to-day. A rood-screen shuts\\noff the choir, the four panels of it facing the nave are particularly\\nfine examples of the art of the early eleventh century. The two centre\\npanels have each a couple of peacocks with necks outstretched feeding on\\nfoliage; and in the two outer two lions are sculptured in perspective, a\\nrather unusual thing for so early a work. These panels support six\\nelegant columns, which in their turn hold a series of painted panels of\\nwood of the fourteenth century on which the Madonna and twelve Apostles\\nare represented. A very fine pulpit, with reading-desk below, is to the\\nnorth of the screen. It has an interesting bas-relief at the base,\\nreconstructed in the twelfth century.\\n\\nBehind the high altar, under which rest the remains of S. Eliodorus, is\\nthe tribune. This part of the church is unique. The apse is arranged in\\neight semicircular rows of seats, occupied at one time by the lesser\\nclergy, in the centre of which, elevated to a position just under the\\nsmall eastern light, is the bishop's throne. The throne is approached by\\na dozen steps separated from the rows of seats by a marble wall. The\\nseats in times gone by were white marble, but have been recently\\nrestored and are now of brick. Despite their present warm colour, the\\ndamp chilliness of this beautiful little church strikes a mournful note\\nhardly relieved by the flaring red brick, or the gorgeous tone of the\\nmosaics which cover the vaulting of the choir and apse.\\n\\nIn the semi-dome of the apse a dignified Madonna and Child gaze serenely\\nbelow, with white-robed Apostles ranged round. The mosaics, however,\\nwhich cover the west wall are of greater artistic interest, being of the\\nninth century. They illustrate the narrative of early Christian\\ntradition and are divided into five bands carrying out its ideas. The\\nmarvellous tessellated floor of the cathedral has withstood, in a\\nwonderful manner, the damp and ravages of time, but, like that of S.\\nMark's, is very uneven. There is an air of decay and long oblivion about\\nthe whole building that nothing can efface.\\n\\nOutside, and joined to the cathedral by a cloistered walk, is the church\\nof Sta. Fosca. Originally a basilica of the ninth century, this much\\ndilapidated little edifice was rebuilt in 1008 in the shape of a Greek\\ncross. A rotunda occupies the centre, inside which runs a grey pillared\\narcade built to support a dome that was never constructed. There are\\nthree apses; the middle one has two rows of blind arcading with\\nornamental brickwork above. A brick loggia, covered with whitewash, is\\noutside, and connects with the cloister and the cathedral. Sta. Fosca\\nsuffered martyrdom at Ravenna her native city, and her remains were\\nbrought here, and this now damp ruinous little church built around them.\\n\\nOn the green grass of the little piazza, which one can hardly realise\\nwas once the focus of a thriving city, stands an ancient stone chair\\ncalled \\\"The Throne of Attila.\\\" It most probably was used at the\\ninauguration ceremony of Torcello's chief magistrates. A column of later\\ndate is beside it, and behind them, occupying one side of this deserted\\nsquare, is the Palazzo del Commune, a building of the thirteenth\\ncentury, now used as the museum wherein are gathered all the relics of\\nTorcello's ancient glory that time unearths. As the gondola carries one\\nback to Venice it threads deserted canals, and passes under many a\\nbridge the voussoirs of which are the only remaining stones of\\nstructures that spanned the water and connected the islands over which a\\npopulous civilisation spread itself. Save for the \\\"quack\\\" of an\\noccasional duck hidden in the reeds of the marsh and the garrulity of\\nthe gondolier all is silence and solitude. A vast sky above but adds to\\nthe feeling of desolation, as, level with the water's edge, we skim\\nalong. Who can tell whether Venice herself one day may not become what\\nfascinating though dreary Torcello now is!\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRIMINI\\n\\n\\nIt is not every visitor to Rome who, passing under the Porta del Popolo\\nand seeing in front a straight road with a row of squalid dwellings on\\none side, knows that that road, the old Via Flaminia, terminates on the\\nAdriatic coast at far-off Rimini. This, the great highway out of Rome\\nnorthwards, enters Rimini under the noble Arch of Augustus, a very fine\\ngateway built of travertine . Passing through the market-place named\\nthe Piazza Giulio Cesare -- for here stands a pedestal with the legend\\nthat from it Julius C\\u00e6sar harangued his troops after the crossing of the\\nRubicon -- it runs on and out of the city over the bridge that crosses the\\nriver Marrecchia. This bridge, which was commenced during the reign of\\nAugustus and finished by Tiberius, is one of the best preserved in\\nItaly. Of its five arches, that in the centre has the greatest span, and\\nthe two which flank it are a little larger than those at either end.\\nTraces of pediments may still be seen on its massive buttresses. The\\nparapet is capped by a rounded stone course. From the two central piers\\ninwards and over the arch this course is raised to a higher level than\\non the remainder of the bridge. In summer a shallow little river\\nmeanders in silvery threads over the pebbles which form the almost dry\\nbed of the stream, and finds its way under the arches into the harbour\\nhalf a mile beyond. In winter a rushing torrent has for centuries beaten\\nagainst the piers that the workmen of Augustus' time laid so well. The\\nroad above, no longer the Via Flaminia but now the Via \\u00c6milia, runs out\\nover the plain in a north-westerly direction to Rome's ancient colonies\\nin the province from which it derives its name. Many fragments and\\ncolumns, let into the walls and forming part of the building material of\\nthe houses of Rimini, are evidence of its importance in the days of the\\nearly emperors. Those were days when it formed with Pesaro, Fano,\\nSinigallia and Ancona, the group known as the five \\\"Maritime Cities,\\\"\\nand was one of the Capital's great Adriatic ports. The sea is but a mile\\noff and the level sands of Rimini nowadays attract hundreds of summer\\nvisitors who take advantage of their unrivalled bathing facilities.\\n\\nThe first bishop was appointed to Ariminium as early as 260, and\\nninety-nine years later the celebrated council of the Arians and\\nAthanasians met to deliberate over their differences in the city. In\\nthe sixteenth century, when it formed part of Otho III.'s empire, a\\nMalatesta was appointed viceroy of Le Marche, and the long connection of\\nthis family with Rimini then commenced. The most renowned member of the\\n\\\"Wrong-heads\\\" was undoubtedly Sigismondo, a man of great ferocity of\\ndisposition and licentious in his habits. Like many another bellicose\\nnoble, Sigismondo had two sides to his nature, and whatever his faults,\\nit is to his credit that many of his leisure hours were spent in the\\ncompany of philosophers and men of pacific tastes. It is due to his\\npatronage of Art that the genius of Leo Battista Alberti, another\\ncurious and complex product of the age, found scope in the great church\\nof S. Francesco. We owe to these two men -- one the patron, the other the\\narchitect -- the best example of transition from Gothic to Renaissance\\nwhich Italy possesses.\\n\\nThe cathedral, a Gothic edifice dedicated to S. Francesco, was but one\\nhundred years old when Sigismondo set Alberti to work on its\\ntransformation. Malatesta undoubtedly intended it to be the mausoleum of\\nhis race, and that is what this most unecclesiastical building, which is\\ncalled the Tempio di Malatesta, is. The fa\\u00e7ade is extremely simple. It\\nis spaced out into three equal divisions. The centre is occupied by the\\nportal which has a good pediment and a round arch borne by highly\\nornate pilasters. On either side are four Corinthian columns supporting\\nthe three flat-membered arches of the fa\\u00e7ade. Over them is a broad\\nfrieze. The bases of these columns stand on a very beautiful course\\nwhich is continued round the two sides of the Tempio. At intervals,\\namidst finely-chiselled heraldic roses and little elephants, are\\nalternating shields bearing the I and S of Isotta and Sigismondo -- initials\\nthat are found in every available place throughout the building -- and\\nthe coat of arms of the Malatesta.\\n\\nOn the north and south sides of the building a grand row of seven broad\\nround arches, on massive rectangular piers, throws a deep shadow on to\\nthe sarcophagi of the men who were Sigismondo's companions in his\\npeaceful hours. These sarcophagi are placed between the piers, well\\nabove the spectator, on the basement which is built out from the brick\\nwall of the original Gothic cathedral. Like the fa\\u00e7ade, this grand\\ncolonnade and its base are lined with white marble. Among the sarcophagi\\nis one which contains a trophy brought by Sigismondo from the East.\\n\\nThe civilisation of the Middle Ages produced a curious phase of religion\\nthat showed itself not only in the Church, which distributed the bodies\\nof Christian martyrs all over the country and robbed the catacombs of\\nRome for sacred relics in order that they might be adored in other\\nplaces, but also in the action of the great nobles, who, to gain a\\nlittle immortality, brought back from distant wars all they could lay\\nhands on that might redound to their heavenly credit. In the case of\\nSigismondo it was, let us believe, a love of literature that prompted\\nthe theft of the bones of the great Platonist, Gemisthus Pletho, and\\nplaced them in the stone chest under one of Alberti's arches. There they\\nrest near those containing the remains of kindred natures whom the\\nwarlike noble claimed as intimate friends.\\n\\nThe interior of the Tempio consists of a nave with side chapels and an\\napsidal choir. The roof is good open woodwork. There are four chapels on\\neither side with the original pointed vault and groining. The Gothic\\narches which open on to the nave are covered with classic ornament. The\\nspandrils are coloured green and are embossed with shields and a\\nsplendid floral design. The wall spaces between each chapel, as well as\\nthe west end, have a wonderful arrangement of very beautiful Corinthian\\npilasters that rest on a sculptured frieze with a blue ground on which\\nare shields bearing the I and S. From this frieze depend floral festoons\\non bands of green and red, with medallions of coloured marble beneath.\\nAt the bases of the pilasters are figures holding shields. The whole of\\nthis design is executed in a grey stone of the same colour as that in\\nthe illustration. The piers of the arches of the two first chapels on\\neither side are enriched by figures of knights and dames; the third by\\nbeautiful panels of nymphs and children carrying garlands, &c., on a\\nlight blue ground reminiscent of the Della Robbia. The fourth chapel on\\nthe south side has figures symbolical of the months of the year and the\\nsigns of the Zodiac; while that on the north has figures of saints on\\nits piers, to which, instead of the usual classic bases, elephants of\\nblack marble have been substituted. The first chapel south is dedicated\\nto S. Sigismondo, who sits on two of these great beasts. The Malatesta\\ncrest is above the altar. On one wall are delicately carved figures of\\nangels drawing aside curtains from a crucifix; repeated on another,\\nwhere the angels in even better attitudes part the curtains from a small\\nclosed window that looks into the Sanctuario. So delicately cut are\\nthese beautiful figures that the art which produced them seems almost\\nplastic. The Sanctuario is closed and contains a fresco of Sigismondo\\nMalatesta kneeling before his patron saint. The next chapel appears in\\nthe illustration. It is dedicated to S. Michele, whose figure above the\\naltar is supposed to be a portrait of Isotta. She is interred in the\\ntomb which the sketch shows. During the life of Sigismondo's two wives\\nshe was his mistress, but at the death of the second he married her and\\nthe record of their wedded life is a happy one. Her tomb is borne by\\nelephants on brackets and is surmounted by a knight's helm with the\\nMalatesta crest above.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe first chapel on the north side of the nave has a tomb placed high up\\non the wall, which contains the remains of as many of Sigismondo's least\\nfamous ancestors as he could lay hands on. The chapel is known as the\\nCapella dell' Acque from an ancient statue of the Madonna which\\nrepresents her as sending down rain. On the base of the pillars of this\\nchapel are portraits in low relief of Sigismondo. The low brow, hooked\\nnose, and cruel mouth tell one plainly that the sardonic expression of\\nthe face does not belie the character of this extraordinary man. On the\\nwall to the right of the west door is his tomb, which, considering the\\npart he played in the history of his day, must be acknowledged as very\\nsimple and plain.\\n\\nThe other chapels are full of the tombs of the illustrious members, male\\nand female, of the House of Malatesta.\\n\\nAlong the length of the nave in front of all these chapels runs a\\nsplendid marble screen or balustrade. At every fourth pillar, on the\\nmarble rail, stands a charming little cherub resting on a shield or\\nholding a bunch of flowers or basket of fruit. The screen of the last\\nchapel on each side is of red Verona marble and is perforated by the\\nelephant head of the Malatesta and gorgeously designed arabesques in\\ncircles. From one end to the other the screens stand out from the\\nchapels into the nave, and are raised two steps above the red-tiled\\nfloor. Such are some of the features which go to make the Tempio di\\nMalatesta one of the most extraordinary cathedrals in Italy.\\n\\nThere is little else to attract the visitor to Rimini, unless it be to\\nundertake a visit to the tiny Republic of S. Marino. A pleasant day's\\nexcursion may be taken to this quaint little stretch of territory which\\nis so picturesquely situated on a spur of the Alban mountains a few\\nmiles from the city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFERRARA\\n\\n\\nAt the foot of the Euganean hills, those hills which stand like\\nsentinels detached from the northern ramparts of Venetia, and guarding\\nthe tract of country that stretches eastwards to the sea between Rovigo\\nand Venice, are the ruins of a castle -- the Castello d'Este -- whose lords\\nat one time played a prominent part in the history of Italy. Of Lombard\\norigin, these Margraves of Este had ruled the surrounding country for\\nthree centuries prior to 1452, in which year Pope Paul III. created\\nBorso d'Este Duke of Ferrara, and the family, as long as it lasted, was\\nthenceforth inseparably connected with the subject of this chapter. More\\nhonours were bestowed on Borso when the Emperor Frederick III. gave him\\nthe titles of Duke of Modena and Reggio, and he held the domains of\\nthose places as fiefs for his overlord. Borso's grandson Alphonso\\nmarried the notorious Lucrezia Borgia; but to Azzo d'Este, Margrave of\\nEste in the year 1110, belongs a greater claim to fame. Scion of a\\njunior branch of the Welfs or Guelphs he succeeded to the Duchy of\\nBavaria on the death of his grandfather, the last male representative\\nof the elder branch of the family, and from his off-spring grew the\\nGuelph Houses of Hanover and Brunswick, from the former of which is\\ndescended our own Royal line. In the sixteenth century the Court of\\nFerrara was second to none in Europe for its patronage of the Arts and\\nLiterature, and the House of Este will always be handed down to\\nposterity as one that did much to raise the culture of Italy to a very\\nhigh pitch.\\n\\nIn the centre of the city, surrounded by a moat and entered by two\\nbridges which span it, the great pile that Ferrara's rulers erected\\nstands haughtily four-square, with four immense towers at the corners.\\nHere in safety dwelt those mighty princes who brought renown to the city\\nthat lay around and beyond; and here in a dungeon below the level of the\\nwater, Duke Niccolo III. caused his wife and her paramour, who was one\\nof his own natural sons, to be put to death; a tragedy which gave Byron\\nhis subject in the poem \\\"Parisina.\\\" This huge fortress, like most of the\\nother buildings in Ferrara, is constructed of brick. Ferrara's streets\\nare wide, and though its palaces and houses do not rise to any great\\nheight, the gardens behind them, enclosed by high walls, give an air of\\nspaciousness and aristocratic bearing that attest its former importance.\\nMost of these palaces and houses are decorated with beautifully moulded\\nbrick or terra cotta courses; and the well-proportioned windows on their\\nflat street fronts create the impression of great space, which is the\\nchief characteristic of Ferrara. There is one important building,\\nhowever, which is constructed of stone, the Palazzo de' Diamanti, so\\ncalled from the peculiar facets of the material with which it is built.\\nFerrara possessed a school of painting of its own, and it is in this\\npalace that the best examples have been placed. The great palace of the\\nBentivoglio family, where many celebrities have lodged, has a heavy\\nstone cornice and baroque decoration on its vast brick sides. The Casa\\ndi Ariosto, built by the poet himself in the years 1526-28, and in which\\nhe died, with an inscription on its walls he composed, is another fine\\nhouse. The hospital of Sta Anna, a most beautiful red brick and terra\\ncotta building, has cloistered courts; and the cellar which was Tasso's\\nprison for five months until he was removed, still a prisoner, to a\\nbetter room, can be seen. In the castello itself Calvin the reformer\\nfound an asylum, befriended by Ren\\u00e9e, the wife of Duke Ercole d'Este,\\nwho paid forfeit for her temerity by being separated from husband and\\nchildren by a Papal Bull.\\n\\nThe Cathedral was begun in 1135, and its exterior belongs almost\\nentirely to that period. The west fa\\u00e7ade is a very good example of\\nLombardo Gothic. It is divided into three equal portions each of which\\nis surmounted by a gable containing what was at one time a wheel window.\\nThe central part has a good porch somewhat similar in design to the one\\nat Verona. The semicircular arch is borne by columns supported by two\\ndwarf figures bent double with the weight of their burden; they squat on\\nthe backs of lions, one of which holds a bull and the other a ram\\nbetween its forepaws. Above this is an open gallery with very beautiful\\ntwisted pillars and quatrefoil piercing in the three arches. In the\\nspandrils of these, and of earlier date, are bas-reliefs of the dead\\nrising from their tombs, and over them at the base of the canopy above\\nare reliefs of the Life of Our Saviour, the Virtues, the Vices and Seven\\nMortal Sins, as well as the Day of Judgment. The two flanking parts of\\nthe fa\\u00e7ade, one of which appears in the illustration, have each three\\ntiers of arcading. The lowest is composed of nine rounded arches with\\nfour-sided columns grouped in triplets, which are enclosed by three\\npointed arches. The next tier is of nine pointed arches; and over this\\nare four pointed arches deeply recessed. Following the line of the gable\\nis an extremely effective gallery of elegant double columns and pointed\\narches, one of the great features of Pisan Gothic so prominent in\\nthe churches of Lucca. Near the base of this wall in a curious pilgrim's\\ndress with a pleated skirt is the figure of Alberto d'Este.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe whole of the south wall has a double range of arches which very\\npleasantly break the monotony of so vast a space of yellow brick. The\\ngrand campanile at the south east-corner was put up by Ercole II., and\\nis composed of four tiers of round arches on columns with Corinthian\\ncapitals. The alternate bands of red and cream toned marble with which\\nthe exterior is faced give a good decorative effect to this big tower.\\n\\nThe interior of the Cathedral has been modernised and painted to\\nrepresent carved stone. Whitewash, generally the alternative to painted\\nimitation of something substantial in construction, is perhaps\\npreferable to this form of deception as it does not really interfere\\nwith the proportions of the architect's design. Here, however, the\\nreally fine proportion of the interior is almost destroyed by the\\nobtrusive colours of the false marble walls, and the representation of\\nbosses and capitals. The semicircular choir by Rossette was built in\\n1499 and has a ceiling covered with a fresco of the Last Judgment by\\nBastianino, who was one of Michael Angelo's favourite pupils. This\\nfresco contains portraits of many of the painter's friends who are\\ndepicted in Heaven, while those with whom he was not on good terms are\\nenduring the tortures of another place.\\n\\nIn the piazza outside the Cathedral a market goes on all day long\\nthroughout the year. It is difficult to analyse the feelings of folk who\\nin the bitterest of weather unfold their great umbrellas over the fruit\\nand vegetables exposed for sale. But so it is in Ferrara during November\\nwhen the accompanying sketch was made, and every morning sees a thick\\ncoat of ice on the moat surrounding the castle. For although the good\\npeople wrapped themselves in heavy cloaks and thick coats and shivered\\nover charcoal stoves, they still sat under their umbrellas. Habit breeds\\ncustom and custom lasts for ages.\\n\\nThe old city walls afford a delightful promenade of four miles or more\\nin length. On one side, the town seems to be right in the middle of a\\nhuge market garden above the trees of which long red roofs and towers\\nrise upwards. On the other, at this time of year, the last leaves from\\nrows of poplars and plane trees may be seen gently falling to the ground\\nin the tranquil frosty air, and when at rest forming a glorious carpet\\nof russet and orange. Great teams of oxen, six couple to a team, are\\nstraining hard at the plough that cuts deep furrows in the stiff soil.\\nThe trees have long ago been trimmed and the peasants now turn their\\nhands to the cutting of clay -- that stiff clay through which the oxen\\ntoil -- for brick-making. Ice covers the water in the fosse, and although\\nthe sun shines brilliantly and the malarial mosquito is no more for at\\nleast eight months, one soon realises that Ferrara is better in the\\nspring than in late autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRAVENNA\\n\\n\\nRavenna is one of those ancient cities the origin of which is lost in\\nthe mist of ages. It is, however, no guess work to say that in the days\\nbefore the first unknown settlers found their way to the spot which\\nbecame their permanent home, the fertile land in which it now lies\\nembowered was a vast waste of waters and salt marshes. The first\\ninhabitants of this dreary region drove piles into the mud, and erected\\ntheir dwellings on such foundations as these afforded. Wooden piles will\\nnot last for ever, and the subsequent buildings that were put up, pulled\\ndown and replaced, have accordingly suffered in stability. When the\\nmarch of Rome carried her legions north, Ravenna was encircled by a\\nseagirt wall, and a Roman colony was established which became in\\nPompey's day a first-class naval station. Alive to the great strategic\\nvalue of the city the Emperor Augustus constructed a new and second\\nharbour capable of holding two hundred and fifty ships, which he named\\nPortus Classis. This he connected by a canal with one of the estuaries\\nof the river Po. Portus Classis lay three miles south of Ravenna, and\\nbetween the two there soon sprang up a connecting link, the town of\\nC\\u00e6sarea. The Emperor Honorius made Ravenna the capital of the West, and\\nboth he and his celebrated sister Placidia resided there.\\n\\nIn 493 Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who had extended his conquests\\nsouthwards over the Alps, captured the city, and Ravenna then became the\\ncapital of the Gothic kingdom. During his reign, a reign marked by\\nabsolute religious toleration, Italy was at peace for thirty years.\\nRavenna must have been at that time some miles from the coast. Jordanes,\\nthe historian, has handed down the fact that its celebrated Pineta, or\\nPine Forest, was in existence in Theodoric's day. Justinian, who drove\\nout the Goths with the help of Belisarius and Narses, left the\\nadministration in the hands of the latter, who became the first Exarch.\\nThe Exarchs of Ravenna practically governed the entire Italian kingdom;\\neven the Popes were subject to a rule which lasted one hundred and\\neighty-five years. In 1512 the Italian war that followed the League of\\nCambray brought a French army under Gaston le Foix into Romagna, and the\\nbloodiest battle ever fought on Italian soil took place not far from the\\ncity; Gaston losing his life towards the close of the engagement at a\\nspot marked by an obelisk.\\n\\nIt is, however, in early Christian Art, nowhere so well exemplified as\\nin the mosaics of Ravenna, that interest is chiefly centred. More than\\nfourteen centuries have come and gone since the first of these wonderful\\nwall decorations were placed where they remain to-day. And though\\nRavenna and its celebrated Pine Forest are inseparably connected with\\nthe immortal Dante and the poet Byron, and though the sarcophagus and\\ntomb of the former, tucked away in a corner of a little piazza, draw\\nmany a pilgrim to worship at his shrine, Ravenna lives in its mosaics\\nand will continue thus to live as long as the walls last on which they\\nare encrusted.\\n\\nTheodoric's great basilica possesses one that is universally accepted as\\nthe finest in the world, but the church of S. Vitale is enriched with\\nthe most splendid of all. Close to S. Vitale is the mausoleum which\\nHonorius' sister, Galla Placidia, built in the form of a Latin cross for\\nherself and her husbands. In its way it is one of the most perfect gems\\nof good taste in mural decoration extant. The interior walls are lined\\nwith rare marbles. The arch over the entrance has a mosaic of the Good\\nShepherd and His Sheep in subdued greens and greys. The vault of the\\nfirst arm of the cross is covered with a most glorious blue ground out\\nof which shines a multitude of stars in white and gold; this leads the\\neye in a perfect harmony of colour to the blue-green ground of the dome,\\nwhereon the four Evangelists and their symbols are portrayed in white\\nand a dull red. The sarcophagus of the Empress still remains in the\\nrecess beyond, and in the lateral arms of the cross are those of her\\nbrother Honorius and her second husband Constantius III. These three\\nstand exactly in the same places as they did fourteen hundred years ago.\\nThe mosaic above Placidia's tomb represents Our Lord with an open book\\nin one hand and a cross in the other. In the centre is a gridiron\\ntowards which He proceeds. On the left side a sort of tomb or cupboard\\nstands open disclosing on its shelves the bodies of the four\\nEvangelists, their names being written beneath each body.\\n\\nIn the other recesses stags are seen drinking at fountains, and birds\\nand arabesques cover the beautiful tesser\\u00e6 groundwork. The soffits of\\nall the windows, which are filled with thin slabs of alabaster, are\\nadorned by a deep red, and a black and white pattern on a gold ground.\\n\\n \\n\\nS. Vitale, the building to the right in the sketch, was erected in the\\nreign of Justinian by Archbishop Ecclesius on the spot where S. Vitalis\\nsuffered martyrdom. Like most of the early buildings of Ravenna it has\\nsuffered from the nature of the ground on which it stands, and is\\nbuttressed up and held together by great iron ties and clamps. The\\ninterior is a vast circle with a domed roof supported by eight arches\\nand the same number of piers, between which are semicircular two-storied\\nrecesses. These are divided by three arches with plain columns that have\\ndouble capitals. A circular aisle extends round the lower part of the\\nchurch carrying a gallery above. The brick walls, against which are\\nplaced many ancient sarcophagi, were originally covered with slabs of\\nmarble, and as S. Vitale and most of Ravenna's other churches are now\\n monumentali nazionale it is to be hoped that marble may some day once\\nmore line this effective interior.\\n\\nThe superb mosaics on the vault of the Choir and Tribune are of the\\nsixth century, and as fresh to-day as when first put up. The semi-dome\\nof the apse has a fine gold ground on which the Almighty is enthroned on\\na globe with Archangels around. Above them float crimson and blue\\nclouds. He gives to S. Vitalis, who stands at His right hand, the crown\\nof martyrdom; on His left is S. Eutychius offering a model of the\\nchurch. The vault of the Tribune itself is decorated with one of the\\nmost gorgeous arrangements of colour in arabesques and birds that could\\nbe imagined. On one wall is a fine mosaic of Justinian surrounded by\\ncourtiers, and S. Maximianus with two accompanying priests. The\\nEmperor's robe is deep purple embroidered with gold and mother-of-pearl,\\nthose that the others wear are white and gold with coloured edging. On\\nthe opposite wall is the Empress Theodora attended by the ladies of her\\ncourt. Here again the costumes give a fine colour note, and the\\nexpressions on the different faces, which are very Eastern in type, are\\nremarkable. A curtain forms part of the background of this mosaic, and\\nis, curiously enough, green, white and red, the Italian colours of the\\npresent day. On the arch are half-lengths of our Saviour and the twelve\\nApostles, and the two martyred sons of S. Vitalis, SS. Gervasius and\\nProtasius whose remains rest in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan.\\n\\nAll the angles of the mosaics are rounded off as in S. Mark's at Venice\\nand elsewhere. But in S. Vitale they are patterned with bands of\\ndistinct colours, and do not interfere with the general effect as they\\ndo in S. Mark's, where the brilliant gold catches the light and\\naccentuates the angle. The whole colour scheme of the decoration is\\ngreen and white relieved by a dull purple, black and deep red set on a\\nrich dull golden ground. However much one admires the later mosaics of\\nVenice and Torcello, Palermo and Monreale, the palm for beautiful colour\\nmust be awarded to the glorious art of Ravenna.\\n\\nAt the bases of the columns in the Choir stand the celebrated pagan\\nbas-reliefs called the \\\"Throne of Neptune.\\\" In both, a sea-monster lies\\nextended beneath the throne of the god. That on the right has a winged\\nfigure holding a trident; in the other, two figures bear a huge conch\\nshell. Sea-horses, dolphins and shells, crowded in between Corinthian\\npilasters, form the lower panels which two nude boys bear on their\\nshoulders staggering under the heavy weight.\\n\\nRavenna's cathedral contains nothing of any architectural interest, as\\nit was rebuilt in the bad period of the eighteenth century. The original\\nedifice, which was erected by S. Ursus in the fourth century, was known\\nas the \\\"Basilica Ursiana.\\\" The Archbishop's Palace adjoins the east end,\\nand in it is one of Ravenna's earliest places of Christian worship. The\\nlittle chapel to which we refer was probably built about 430 and was the\\nwork of Peter Chrysologos. With the exception of painted restorations to\\nsome of its frescoes it is to-day just as it was when the decorators\\nleft it more than fourteen hundred years ago. In the vestibule leading\\nto the chapel one may see the ivory throne of S. Maximianus. This fine\\nspecimen of sixth-century art is covered with little ivory panels on\\nwhich bas-reliefs tell the history of Joseph. In front of the seat are\\nthe Saint's monogram, the panels beneath representing the favourite\\ntheme of our Lord as a shepherd amidst his sheep, with the four\\nEvangelists attendant. The four legs of the throne appear to be solid\\nivory; those at the back go right up to the top and must at one time\\nhave been splendid tusks.\\n\\nTo the north of the Cathedral is the Baptistery. The mosaics of the\\nfifth century which line the interior are in a very light key of colour,\\nthe scheme employed being light blue, white and gold. Situated between\\nthe eight arches of the octagon are sixteen bas-reliefs of the prophets\\nexecuted in a cream-coloured marble. The arches themselves are composed\\nof two members, one within the other, the outer of which is gold edged\\nwith white; and the inner has a remarkably fine quality of blue\\n tesser\\u00e6 . In the centre of the dome S. John is seen baptizing our\\nSaviour, who stands in the waters of Jordan surrounded by the twelve\\nApostles. The font, which stands on a fine inverted Corinthian capital,\\nwas at one time a vase in the Temple of Jupiter. This Temple was\\nsituated on the site of the Baptistery, and eight of its columns form\\nthe support of the octagon arches.\\n\\nThe cathedral, which is the church with a dome in the illustration,\\npossesses one of the round towers peculiar to Ravenna. The date of these\\ntowers is uncertain, but is probably the eleventh or twelfth century.\\nInsecure foundations have caused most of them to tilt to one side -- note\\nthe angle of the Torre del Pubblico in the sketch -- and necessitated a\\ngreat deal of restoration.\\n\\nTheodoric erected his palace and the basilica which adjoins, in the wide\\nthoroughfare that runs north and south from the Porta Serrata to the\\nPorta Nuova. Very little, if anything, remains of the first-named\\nbuilding. And judging from the Romanesque features of a brick colonnade\\nand the portion of a sometime large dwelling that stands behind it, it\\nis very doubtful whether any of the original palace exists. We have it\\non record, too, that Charles the Great carried off the marble columns of\\nTheodoric's building to adorn his own palace in Aachen; and, as he did\\nthis, there is every probability that he took other material as well.\\nBut, if we have nothing left of the Gothic king's residence, we have his\\ngrand Arian basilica intact. Theodoric dedicated his church to S.\\nMartin, but when the body of S. Apollinaris was deposited in it, a\\nrededication to him took place. S. Apollinare Nuovo, as it has since\\nbeen called in contradistinction to the other basilica at Classis, is\\nfamous throughout Christendom; famous for the finest mosaic in the\\nworld. On the north wall, in the blank space where the triforium might\\nbe, facing the sun, the Virgin is seen seated on an orange coloured\\ncushion which rests upon a throne. She holds in her lap the Child. Two\\nangels stand on either side. Their robes are white, hers is deep purple\\nfringed with gold and sparkling jewels. Advancing towards her are the\\nThree Kings of the East, whose names appear above each, Melchior, Gaspar\\nand Balthassar. In their hands are silver vessels. The first angel holds\\nhis out to receive them. Beyond the kings, in a row, twenty-two virgins\\ncome bearing crowns. They are garbed in light purple with white veils;\\nround their waists are bejewelled belts. The expression on the face of\\neach is different, and each is in a slightly different attitude; one is\\naccompanied by a little white dog. They tread lightly on the green sward\\nfrom which many little flowers lift their humble heads. Between each a\\npalm-tree grows with spreading leaves and clustering dates. It is a\\nwonderful procession. The eagerness and haste of the Three Kings, the\\ndignified and stately rhythm of the slowly pacing Virgins are so well\\nrealised, that, although there is no idea of anything but flat\\ndecoration in the rendering, a feeling of continuous motion holds one\\nthroughout. In the darkened corner at the west end of the mosaic\\nare the walls of the City of Classis. The golden tesser\\u00e6 of these\\nwalls are so dark and frowning that they might almost be called brown.\\nBrown they appear to be, but this is because, through an arched opening,\\nthree ships with white sails come gliding into port over the c\\u00e6rulean\\nblue of the sea. The eye is thus carried along the whole length of the\\nmosaic without a single jarring note. From the white angels at one end\\nto the white sails at the other, it travels along with a consciousness\\nof repose, and one feels instinctively that one is in the presence of a\\nmasterpiece.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn the opposite wall, occupying the same position as Classis, are the\\ncity of Ravenna and the palace of Theodoric. Corresponding with the two\\nand twenty virgins are figures of twenty-five saints clad in white -- save\\none -- and all bearing crowns. Our Saviour, seated between four angels,\\ngives His benediction to the saints, who advance towards Him. The first,\\nin a violet robe, is S. Martinus, the patron of the Church when the\\nsound of the Arian creed filled its aisles. Above both these mosaics are\\nround-headed clerestory windows with saints and prophets in the panels\\nbetween. The ancient marble throne of the Arian bishops still exists in\\na little chapel in the north aisle; and here also are some relics of S.\\nApollinaris.\\n\\nOne of the architectural features of Ravenna's churches may be seen in\\nthe double capitals of the columns, which give them a sort of stilt, a\\npeculiarity which does not prevail in churches elsewhere of the same\\ndate -- the fifth and sixth centuries. Into these two centuries were\\ncrowded the great architectural works and their interior decorations\\nthat have made Ravenna famous. But it is sad to think that the names of\\nthose whose genius found scope on their walls, if ever recorded, have\\nbeen lost.\\n\\nThe other great basilica, dedicated to S. Apollinaris, S. Apollinare in\\nClasse, stands in solemn loneliness some three miles south of the city.\\nOf Augustus' great port this church, emblem of stability, alone remains.\\nIts round campanile towers up over the swampy meadows and uninhabited\\ndistrict that seem given up entirely to the sky and winds. An atrium,\\nnow reduced to a portico, stood at one time in front of the fa\\u00e7ade, but\\nthere is nothing to attract one in the barn-like exterior of the\\nbuilding save the glamour attached to its history, which is accentuated\\nby the dreary desolation around.\\n\\nInside, the nave is divided by twelve round arches on each side; these\\nare supported by columns of cipollino marble. The Byzantine capitals,\\nas in S. Apollinare in Nuovo, are surmounted by an impost with a cross\\nin relief. A fine flight of steps leads up to the High Altar, Choir and\\nTribune. The crypt is beneath. The floor of the nave, which slopes\\nupwards towards the east, is four feet above the original, which was\\npartly covered with mosaic. A temple of Apollo stood on the site before\\nthe church was erected in the year 534, and this older floor may be part\\nof the pagan building.\\n\\nThe mosaics of the Choir and Tribune were undergoing restoration at the\\ntime when this was written, but although partly covered up enough was\\nvisible to show that in the semi-dome of the apse a large golden cross,\\nwith a representation of the Almighty's Head in the centre, occupied the\\nmiddle of a very brilliant blue circle. The soffit of the arch of the\\nChoir has a blue ground covered with multi-coloured birds and\\narabesques.\\n\\nAmongst other of Ravenna's churches the modernised basilica of S.\\nFrancesco, the church contiguous to Dante's tomb, contains some ancient\\nsarcophagi and the finest tomb slab in Italy. This is now out of danger\\nand has been placed on the west wall of the nave. It originally covered\\nthe remains of Ostasio da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna. He is represented in\\nthe garb of a Franciscan friar and lies outstretched, with beautifully\\nmodelled hands and face, under a very rich Gothic canopy. The Polenta\\nfamily were the first to befriend the great poet when he sought refuge\\nhere from Florence.\\n\\nAdjoining the back premises of one of the hotels is the old Arian\\nbaptistery, now the oratory of Sta. Maria in Cosmedin. It was here that\\nthe first Christian baptism in Ravenna took place. The church of S.\\nSpirito built by Theodoric opens on to the same courtyard; but, next to\\nthe Gothic king's great basilica, the most interesting building\\nconnected with his name is that which is situated half a mile outside\\nthe Porta Serrata.\\n\\nA pleasant avenue with well-kept rose beds leads one on towards a\\ncircular building of grey Istrian limestone, which is covered with a\\ndome of the same material, and we are in the presence of the tomb which\\nTheodoric erected as the resting-place for his mortal remains. We do not\\nsee it now as it was when the great king's bones reposed in a\\nsarcophagus within. To the Church of Rome Theodoric was a heretic, and\\nwhen the Goths were driven out of Ravenna and the Arian ritual was heard\\nno more, the Church ordered the sarcophagus to be broken up, and the\\nashes of him who was tolerant to all creeds to be scattered to the\\nwinds. The tomb was despoiled of its ornaments, and consecrated and used\\nas a chapel. Even now it is sublime in its simplicity, and grand in its\\nmassive construction. Its plan is a rotunda resting on a decagonal lower\\nchamber, each side of which is recessed and arched by great blocks of\\nlimestone set as the Etruscans set the roofs of their tombs. Rising in\\ntwo storeys from the ground, which is six feet below the present level\\nof the surrounding orchards, its dome is barely visible above the tops\\nof the fruit trees. The lower storey rests on a platform of stone. Its\\npavement is always under a few inches of water. The upper storey is\\nreached by two flights of steps which, built outside, give entrance to\\nthe sepulchral chamber from a gallery or platform that circulates round\\nthe exterior. This gallery formed at one time a portico. The shafts and\\nbases of the colonnade were found buried in the ground when the last\\nrestoration took place in 1857. A massive cornice with a circular\\npattern is on the wall above, and the empty sockets placed at regular\\nintervals, which one sees below it, presumably held the stone that\\nformed the roof. The dome is one huge block of stone estimated to weigh\\ntwo hundred tons. On its exterior, close to the edge, are a dozen\\nperforated projections. It is thought that these were used as handles\\nwhen the mass was put into position. The summit is flat, and on it at\\none time a statue may have stood. Simplicity is almost always one of the\\ncharacteristics of the great, and the mausoleum which he erected was\\nworthy, in its strength and plainness, of Theodoric the Goth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOLOGNA\\n\\n\\nThe traveller in Italy must often have noticed the difference in the\\nshape of the battlements that nowadays add so much to the\\npicturesqueness of old towers and half-ruined fortress walls. No doubt\\nhe has heard the term \\\"Guelph\\\" or \\\"Ghibelline\\\" applied to them. It is\\nsupposed that \\\"Welf\\\" and \\\"Waiblingen\\\" were first used in Germany as\\nbattle-cries at the conflict of Weinsberg in 1140. When the struggle for\\nthe imperial throne between Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick was\\nhanging in the balance, the sympathies of Brescia, Milan, and other\\nLombard cities were enlisted on the side of Otto the Welf. In the\\nsubsequent feuds between the Pope's party and the Emperor's it became a\\nnecessity for the inhabitants of the cities of the northern part of the\\npeninsula, if they wished to exist at all, to favour either one side or\\nthe other. The Guelph party were for the Pope, and the Ghibelline were\\npartisans of the Emperor. And thus we find in the history of most of\\nthese towns an espousal, as policy dictated, of the Pope's cause at one\\ntime, and of the Emperor's some decades later. This apparent\\ninconsistency was the outcome of family feuds within the city walls. For\\na term of years the Guelphic nobles might be in the ascendant, until, on\\nthe death or murder of a leading member, they succumbed to the prowess\\nof the imperial party. The great families that pinned their faith to the\\nascendency of the latter adopted the swallow-tailed battlement on the\\ntowers of their castle walls, to distinguish them from the square-shaped\\nthat were already in existence. Italy throughout the middle ages was\\ntorn by internecine strife which was reflected throughout every class of\\nsociety, and the subject of this chapter was no exception. Owning\\nallegiance to the Pope, the Bolognese overran Romagna and forced the\\ntowns of that province to declare for the Church. In 1249 they defeated\\nthe Modenese at Fossalto and took King Enzio prisoner. For\\ntwo-and-twenty years -- in fact, for the rest of his life -- they kept the\\nunhappy man confined in the Palace of the Podest\\u00e0, treated however, as\\nwe should treat a first-class misdemeanant, and according to his rank.\\nThe long-drawn-out feuds of the Lambertazzi and Gieremei families, and\\nlater on those between the great Visconti and Bentivoglio, kept the\\nBolognese in a perpetual state of faction fights, which lasted until the\\nwarlike Pontiff Julius II. annexed the city to the States of the\\nChurch.\\n\\nTo go back to its earliest days, we learn that the Etruscan king,\\nFelsina, founded a city in 984 B.C. where Bologna now stands. He gave it\\nhis own name, and made it the chief of his twelve Etruscan cities.\\nBologna can thus, with legitimate pride, point to a history approaching\\nthree thousand years. We find it to-day a typical modern place, with\\njust enough of the middle ages left to make it one of the most desirable\\nof all North Italian cities. It possesses hardly a street which is not\\narcaded; and the thought arises: \\\"How admirably adapted for street\\nfighting were these sheltered walks in the days when one half of the\\ntown was at strife with the other!\\\" In the oldest parts of the city the\\nstreets are tortuous and narrow. Arcades in such streets would be just\\nthe very best cover for raiders to steal along at night; and such must\\nhave been the terror of the inhabitants during centuries of discord that\\nthere is scarcely a house which has any windows opening into the\\narcades, and those that do are heavily barred. Walking through these\\nstreets, silent witnesses of bloody feuds and severe fights, one cannot\\nsuppress the feeling that the old quarters of Bologna are full of\\nmystery, and it does not require much imagination to see the Visconti\\nparty creeping along in the shadowed ways for an attack on their\\nhereditary foes, the Bentivoglio.\\n\\nSo much for the thoughts awakened by Bologna's narrow thoroughfares.\\nIts chief open square is the Piazza Maggiore, as fine an old Italian\\nsquare as can be found anywhere. The celebrated Fontana de Nettuno is in\\nthe centre. A nude bronze statue of the god by Giovanni da Bologna\\nstands eight feet high, in a somewhat repellent attitude, above the\\npedestal and basin. It is always the centre of a lounging crowd which\\nthrongs the square throughout the day. On the west side of the Piazza is\\nthe Palazzo Pubblico, with a fa\\u00e7ade that still retains, despite\\nrestoration, traces of eight elegant pointed windows. A figure of the\\nVirgin in terra-cotta, once gilded, stands under a good canopy high up\\non the empty space of the great wall of the fa\\u00e7ade. These comparatively\\nempty wall spaces are a feature of Bolognese architecture of the\\nthirteenth century. Pierced by a few windows, they give a great idea of\\nsolidity and strength; and though one finds the same character in the\\npalaces of Tuscan cities, it is not so prominent there as in the big\\nbuildings of Bologna. An immense entrance gateway opens into a\\ncourtyard, and from this a very fine staircase by Bramante leads up to\\nthe interior. In a smaller court beyond is a very beautiful cistern by\\nTerribilia. The Hall of Hercules, so called from the colossal statue by\\nAlfonso Lombardo, vies with the Sala Farnese in splendour. Up to the\\nyear 1848 the palace was the residence of the Legate and the Senator.\\nThe lower portion is now the chief post office of the city.\\n\\nOn the north side of the Piazza is the Palazzo del Podest\\u00e0. It is a\\nbuilding that was begun at the commencement of the thirteenth century,\\nbut not until the year 1485 was the fa\\u00e7ade erected. Of magnificent\\nproportions, it is chiefly famous as the prison of King Enzio. The great\\nsaloon is still called the Sala del Re Enzio, and among other\\nvicissitudes was at one time a theatre, and at another the court in\\nwhich the national game of pallone was played. A solid-looking and\\nlofty tower, the Torrazzo dell' Aringo, rises at one end of the fa\\u00e7ade\\nabove the arcades. On the piers which carry the arches of these may\\nstill be seen the huge wrought-iron brackets, the rings, and the sockets\\nfor supporting banner poles and holding lighted torches.\\n\\nAlong the east side of this part of the Piazza which is =L=-shaped, is the\\nPortico de' Banchi, a continuous arcade, extending beyond the limits of\\nthe square the whole length of Bologna's great church. This, the church\\nthat the Bolognese in their pride intended should be the largest in\\nItaly, has not been completed beyond the commencement of the transepts.\\nThe nave and aisles alone are finished; they are three hundred and\\neighty-four feet long, and the width, including the chapels, measures\\none hundred and fifty. The building is proportionately high, and, as\\nwill be seen in the illustration, is very spacious. It was commenced in\\n1390 and dedicated to S. Petronio. The architect, Antonio Vincenzi, was\\none of the celebrated Riformati , and went as ambassador to the\\nVenetian Republic in 1396.\\n\\nThe Piazza Maggiore slopes downwards from the south. S. Petronio is\\nsituated at its southern end, and orientates south by west. The fa\\u00e7ade\\ntherefore faces north-east, and for the construction of a level floor\\nthe great church is placed at this end some dozen steps above the\\nsloping Piazza. In the museum attached to S. Petronio there may be seen\\nthe original designs, elevations, and a model of the finished structure.\\nHad funds permitted, this fa\\u00e7ade, placed so well, and with such\\nmagnificent buildings surrounding it, would have been one of the best\\nItalian attempts to realise a Gothic church. As it is, it is a grand\\nscheme unfulfilled.\\n\\nThe lower portion of the fa\\u00e7ade is extremely good, the three canopied\\ndoorways being pure Italian Gothic. They are adorned with bas-reliefs\\nwhich represent different scriptural events from the Creation onwards.\\nTribolo, an intimate friend of Benvenuto Cellini, was responsible for\\nthe beautiful angels and sibyls round the arch of that on the left\\nhand. The fine bas-relief of the Resurrection in the lunette, where\\nChrist is seen among sleeping soldiers, is by Alfonso Lombardi. The\\ncentral portal is considered the masterpiece of Jacopo della Quercia,\\nwho was not overpaid by the three thousand golden florins he received\\nfor the work, considering that it took him twelve years to complete. His\\nnoble figure of the Almighty, surrounded by thirty-two patriarchs and\\nprophets, is extremely fine. The right-hand doorway is another example\\nof Tribolo's purity of style. The brickwork of the exterior is covered,\\nround the whole church at the base, by a very fine base-table of white\\nmarble with good mouldings. In the model the entire brick surface is\\nhidden by the same material. The buttresses are good, and so are the\\npointed windows of the aisles, some of which, by the way, contain good\\nglass.\\n\\nThe interior is very lofty and expansive. Twelve immense piers carry the\\narches of the nave, twenty-four smaller ones those of the aisles. The\\nheight of all these may be judged from the illustration, wherein also\\nthe peculiar Italian Gothic capital is seen. Milan's great cathedral and\\nS. Anastasia in Verona are other specimens of the same style of capital.\\nThey appear to be stuck on to the columns, of which they seem to form a\\npart, rather than a separate cap for the arches to rest on. One hardly\\nknows how this particular style grew or where it emanated, but it is not\\nunlike the palm-leaf capital of an Egyptian column. The aisles are\\nrather shallow for the width of the nave. The side chapels are shut off\\nfrom them by good metal grilles or beautiful marble screens. Four very\\nancient black pillars with crosses engraved stand against four of the\\naisle piers. They are supposed to have been placed at the gates of old\\nBologna by S. Petronio himself, and are much venerated by the Bolognese.\\nOn the floor of the church is traced the celebrated meridian line of\\nGian Domenico Cassini. Under the immense canopy which stands over the\\nhigh altar Charles V. was crowned in 1530 by Pope Clement VII. The\\nEmperor had been invited to Italy by the last of the Ducal House of\\nSforza, and with his coronation commenced the foreign occupation of\\nNorth Italy.\\n\\nBologna's cathedral is dedicated to S. Pietro. It is situated in the Via\\ndell' Indipendenza, but is so wedged in between the high buildings which\\nadjoin it on both sides that it is difficult to find. S. Pietro is a\\nhuge barn-like edifice commenced in the bad period of 1605. It is a very\\nancient foundation with no redeeming architectural features. The most\\ninteresting thing it contains is Ludovico Carracci's celebrated\\n\\\"Annunciation.\\\" After the scaffolding had been removed on the\\ncompletion of the work which is over the arch above the high altar,\\nCarracci discovered some bad drawing in one of the figures. He died soon\\nafter this -- from grief, so the story goes, as the authorities would not\\npermit him to re-erect it at his own cost and remedy the defect.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe church of S. Stefano, or rather the seven different edifices which\\nare thus named, occupies the site of a temple of Isis. It stands below\\nthe level of the little Piazza de S. Stefano, and on its exterior wall\\nis one of the open-air pulpits not uncommon in Italy. The first church,\\ncalled Il Crocifisso, is of the sixteenth century and not interesting.\\nFrom a door in the north wall one goes down half a dozen steps into the\\nsecond church of the Santo Sepolcro. This is a circular building,\\nsupposed to have been the old baptistery. Twelve columns, brick and\\nmarble alternating, support a good Romanesque gallery under the dome.\\nThe six marble shafts came from the pagan temple. In the centre is a\\ngrand altar-pulpit, which has a stairway leading up on either side.\\nUnder the altar is an urn which at one time held the remains of S.\\nPetronio. On the stone floor a shutter of iron covers the well that\\npossesses miraculous properties, these having been imparted to it by the\\nsaint. The church dates from the tenth century. An iron grille in one of\\nthe walls shuts off the oldest church of all, a basilica of the fourth\\ncentury. It is dedicated to SS. Paolo e Pietro. Forty-eight columns with\\nByzantine and Greek capitals support the brick barrel vault of the nave.\\nThis is dimly lighted by small round clerestory windows. The altar\\nstands in the tribune at the top of much-worn limestone steps. This also\\nhas a brick vault. At the end of the narrow aisles are the sarcophagi of\\nS. Agricola and S. Vitalis -- Bologna's S. Vitalis. The next church, if it\\nmay be so called, is formed by the small court known as the Atrio di\\nPilato. It has never been touched since the eleventh century, and\\ncontains a very ancient font. Down more steps is the church of the\\nConfessio. This old crypt must be a good twenty feet below the level\\noutside. The quadripartite vaulting is borne by thick stunted columns\\nthat are barely five feet high, though one is said to be the exact\\nheight of Christ. It is very dark, and dates from the tenth century. The\\nsixth church is the passage which leads to the seventh and last, that of\\nthe Trinity. Four rows of columns with Byzantine and Romanesque capitals\\nsupport the roof of this square building. In one of the chapels, in a\\ngalleried niche, there is an extraordinary life-sized wooden group of\\nthe Adoration of the Magi. Mary wears a crown of brass studded with\\nuncut stones. On the Child's head is a mitre of the same. The\\nexpressive faces of the Three Kings, who bring offerings, are extremely\\nna\\u00efve. The first wears the conical hat of the ancient shepherds of the\\nhills of Venetia that one still comes across in out-of-the-way\\ndistricts.\\n\\nThe adjoining cloisters of the suppressed Celestine monastery are\\nremarkable in the solidity of the short pillars, not four feet high,\\nwhich form the lower colonnade. These are in absolute contradistinction\\nto the elegant double shafts of the upper gallery. The brickwork\\nthroughout the whole of S. Stefano is very good. Concentric patterns,\\nsquares, chequer work where small squares of marble and glazed tiles\\nhave been introduced, diamonds, and oblongs are arranged in a perfect\\nharmony of design the like of which one cannot find in Italy. The\\nexterior of S. Sepolcro is, in this respect, unsurpassed.\\n\\nBologna's university is one of the oldest in Italy, and the first in\\nwhich academical degrees were conferred. It was founded in 1119 by\\nIrnerius. Numerous schools were established in the West after Byzantine\\nauthority had faded away. Among the first was that of Bologna, where\\nPepo began to expound the law in 1075. Irnerius followed him\\nfive-and-twenty years later and introduced the Justinian code. His\\nfollowers became known as Glossatori, a word derived from the Greek\\n \\nglossators was Accursius, who compiled the gloss\\u00e6 known as the \\\"Glossa\\nordinaria,\\\" a work which soon became the acknowledged authority. The\\nvisitor who wanders through the city and finds himself in the\\nmarket-square will there see outside the church of S. Francesco three\\ncanopied tombs. The sarcophagi which rest on a platform borne by pillars\\nare those of three Glossatori, and one of them contains the remains of\\nAccursius. The canopies of these tombs are covered with green tiles. S.\\nFrancesco is a fine Gothic church with two elegant campanili . It is\\nundergoing extensive restoration, and, though of some architectural\\ninterest, does not compare in other ways with that of S. Domenico.\\n\\nThis church, wherein repose the remains of the founder of the Order of\\nPreaching Friars or Dominicans, was begun with the intention of\\nfollowing the prevailing fashion of the day and constructing another\\nGothic fabric. Except for the pointed windows in some of the chapels, S.\\nDomenico bears no traces of this intention. The interior of white\\nmarble, in a medley of styles in which poor Renaissance predominates, is\\nvery cold. The exterior has a very heavy frieze of white marble; the\\ncommencement of its outer covering carried no further than this. It is\\nseen in the sketch, which also shows the canopied tomb of the\\nlearned jurist, Rolandino Passageri, who was selected by the city to\\nframe the reply to the letter in which the Emperor Frederick II.\\ndemanded the release of his illegitimate son Enzio. In the church lie\\nGuido Reni, whose tomb is in the chapel shown with the heavy frieze, and\\nhis talented fellow-artist Elisabetta Sirani, King Enzio, Taddeo Pepoli,\\nCaptain of the People in 1334, and the great S. Dominick.\\n\\n \\n\\nBorn in Old Castile in 1170, S. Dominick was ordained priest in 1198.\\nHis fiery zeal against \\\"heretics\\\" and his extraordinary preaching powers\\nsoon brought him into great prominence. He was instrumental in\\nestablishing courts for trial and punishment of obstinate \\\"heretics.\\\"\\nThe commissioners, who were invested with a jurisdiction that gave them\\npowers of torture, and life and death, were known as \\\"Inquisitors,\\\" and\\ntheir conclaves paved the way for the dreaded Inquisition. S. Dominick's\\ntomb is one of the finest in North Italy. It is one of the earliest\\nworks that the genius of Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano produced, having been completed\\nthirty years before his masterpiece at Pisa was begun. A magnificent\\niron grille separates the chapel from the nave. On the top rail are four\\nvery charming little figures in bronze of saints. The tomb is adorned by\\nbas-reliefs illustrating the chief events in the life of the saint.\\nBelow these is a very delicately carved set of smaller ones by Alfonso\\nLombardi, which form a sort of predella , and are nearly three hundred\\nyears later. The urn which contains the saint's remains is behind the\\nupper set. A small statue of S. Petronio in front is by Michael Angelo,\\nand the best of the beautiful little angels at the corners claims the\\nsame hand as its sculptor. Cherubs at the top of the monument hold two\\nvery heavy festoons of flowers, which somewhat mar the fine composition\\nof the whole. From this it is evident that the exuberance of Pisano's\\nyouth had yet to learn the reticence which comes with age.\\n\\nNo description of Bologna would be complete without mention of its\\nwonderful towers. The graceful Torre Asinelli rises to a height of three\\nhundred and twenty-one feet, and, although nearly four feet out of the\\nperpendicular, tapers upwards so imperceptibly that the inclination is\\nnot noticeable. Close by it stands the Torre Garisenda, built by the two\\nbrothers Garisenda. It leans ten feet in one direction and three in\\nanother, and rises to a height of one hundred and sixty feet. Although\\nthe guide-books tell one it was thus constructed, it has undoubtedly\\nsunk into its position, as the different stages inside slope with the\\ninclination of the tower. These two are not the only towers of Bologna,\\nbut, being situated in the centre of the oldest quarters of the city,\\nare those that are best known.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARMA\\n\\n\\nParma is very much like any other of the smaller cities of Italy. It can\\nhowever boast of a prehistoric lake-dwelling settlement, unearthed in\\n1864, and a still later, though very early origin as an Etruscan colony.\\nTo-day it is a bright little place pleasantly situated on the broad\\nstream that gave it its name. If it were not, however, for its\\ncathedral, its ancient baptistery, and its inseparable connection with\\nthe art of Correggio, there would be but little to interest the stranger\\nor even call for a halt at its railway station. Four bridges span the\\nriver Parma, and from each the blue line of the Apennines may be seen\\nstretching away over the tops of the orchards until lost in the distant\\nhaze. The old Roman road, the Via \\u00c6milia, which we have already seen\\nstarted out of Rimini, bisects Parma from east to west, and crosses the\\nriver by a fine old bridge, the Ponte de Mezzo. This is the only\\nstructure of the four which can lay claim to any age. It has a narrow\\nroadway inclining up to the centre with high parapets on either side,\\nand partakes very much of the character of a Roman edifice. Except for\\na few inscribed slabs there is nothing of any consequence left to remind\\none that the pleasant little city of to-day was once a flourishing\\ncolony of Imperial Rome. In the Guelph and Ghibelline feuds it espoused\\nthe Pope's cause and successfully withstood a siege by Frederick II. In\\n1341 it came into the hands of the Visconti, Dukes of Milan, and was\\nassociated with that duchy for two hundred years. Pope Julius II.\\nincorporated it with the Papal States, and thirty years after this the\\nreigning Pope, Paul III., gave it to his natural son Pietro Luigi\\nFarnese. This family supplied seven dukes to Parma where they reigned\\nuntil the male line became extinct in the year 1731. The Bourbons came\\ninto possession of the duchy through Marie Louise, and with the\\nassassination in the public thoroughfare of Duke Charles III., its\\nhistory may be said to have come to an end.\\n\\nThe cathedral and baptistery, with the ecclesiastical buildings which\\nform the square in which they stand, make a group of much interest. The\\nfirst named is a very fine example of Romanesque work. It was commenced\\nin 1058, but not consecrated until fifty years later, nor really\\ncompleted till the middle of the thirteenth century. The fa\\u00e7ade is\\nhowever entirely the original design.\\n\\n \\n\\nTwo rows of arcades traverse its length; the lower is on a level with\\nand carried through the upper portion of the central porch. A third\\nfollows the line of the gable under a heavy cornice. The porch is\\nsimilar to the one illustrated of Verona's cathedral. Two colossal lions\\nbear the burden of the double canopies and were the work of Bono da\\nBisone. The sun is sculptured on the keystone of the arch, and in the\\nsoffits the months are illustrated by a series of reliefs of\\nagricultural pursuits, as in S. Mark's at Venice. A good many Roman\\ntablets have been used as decoration and for building material along the\\nwhole fa\\u00e7ade. Two other doors, as well as the central portal, give\\nentrance to the church. The only other feature of the exterior worth\\nmention is the beautiful red brick campanile with its green tiled\\nspire.\\n\\nThe first impression one receives of the interior is that of extreme\\nsolemnity and great majesty. It never wears off. The high altar, a blaze\\nof silver and gilt, stands well placed eighteen steps above the nave.\\nThe transepts also are thus situated, and there is enough length in the\\nseven bays that separate the aisles from the nave to put the choir well\\nback from the spectator as he enters at the west door. From the high\\naltar the eye instinctively travels upwards to the spandrils in the drum\\nof the dome where part of Correggio's grand frescoes are seen. The\\nfourteen fluted columns of the nave are quadrangular. Seven have\\nCorinthian capitals and seven are Romanesque with traces of Byzantine\\norigin in the figures, beasts and birds which form the volutes. Some of\\nthese are peacocks with curling outstretched necks; others are the heads\\nand upper limbs of human figures. The triforium gallery has elegant\\npillars in pairs, that support round arches. The clerestory is placed\\nvery high. The vaulting of the nave is peculiar, it is elliptical. The\\nwhole of the walls are covered with frescoes by Lattanzio Gambara and\\nGirolamo Mazzuola, who was a pupil of Parmigianino. A frieze is above\\nthe capitals of the fluted pilasters that support the arch of the choir\\nand runs on into the transepts. It is symbolical of the strength of the\\nChurch. Lions are seen here hunting antelopes, deer, and other animals;\\nthat is, the Church is chasing away all evil doers.\\n\\nThe crypt under the choir is architecturally interesting, as it shows in\\nsome of the capitals of its thirty-eight columns the evolution from pure\\nByzantine to Lombardo-Romanesque work. But perhaps it will be the\\nfrescoes in the dome that draw visitors to this fine church rather than\\nits architectural features. In the decoration of this Correggio\\nsurpassed himself in his mastery of chiaroscuro and the foreshortening\\nof the human figure. The \\\"Assumption of the Virgin,\\\" though very\\nadversely criticised when finished, and now greatly injured by damp and\\nneglect, is still one of the grandest paintings of its sort extant.\\n\\nAlmost adjoining the south-west corner of the cathedral, and built on\\nsloping ground, stands Parma's celebrated baptistery. It was begun in\\nthe year 1196, from designs by Benedetto Antelami. The construction was\\nfor many years very spasmodic, and wholly ceased when the bloodthirsty\\nEzzelino da Romana governed North Italy for Frederick II. in the\\nthirteenth century, and forbade the inhabitants to quarry any more\\nmarble. At his death it was pushed on, and in the end finished towards\\nthe close of that century, a date which accounts for the pointed arches\\nat the top of the interior. It is built of Verona marble, and is an\\noctagon with three arched portals, on which are some very interesting\\nsculptures of Old Testament history. Jacob, out of whom grows a tree in\\nthe branches of which are his brothers with Moses at the top, is on one\\nside of the north door. Another tree, with David and Solomon and the\\nProphets, is a pendant on the other. The south doorway is decorated in a\\nsimilar style, but the trees are full of all the birds apparently then\\nknown. Barn-door fowls, storks, parrots, eagles, ducks, and peacocks,\\n&c. &c., find a place in this extraordinary aviary in stone. Signs of\\nthe Zodiac form a sort of frieze on the lower portions of the eight\\nsides of the exterior. Four tiers of columns forming open galleries\\nsupport a continuous architrave, which, whatever the architectural\\nmerits, is not artistically a pleasing arrangement. The interior is\\nsixteen-sided. Between each division a long marble shaft is carried from\\nits base on the floor right up to the converging ribs of the pointed\\nvaulting. The whole of the walls and vault are covered with frescoes.\\nThe upper are early, and appear to be almost contemporaneous with the\\nfinishing of the building. The lower bear the names of Niccolo da Reggio\\nand Bartolino da Piacenza, and are of fourteenth-century date. The Life\\nof John the Baptist naturally takes precedence in these interesting\\nexamples of mural decoration. The huge font in the centre of the\\nbaptistery is cut out of a single block of marble. It has a centre\\ncompartment like that already described in S. Giovanni in Fonte, in\\nVerona. The registers of the baptistery go back as far as the year 1459,\\nsince when it is known that all the babies born in Parma have been\\nreceived into the Faith within its walls.\\n\\nThe church of S. Lodovico, also called S. Paolo, was formerly attached\\nto a Benedictine nunnery. Correggio's celebrated series of pagan\\nfrescoes cover the walls of the \\\"parlour\\\" of the nunnery. They were\\nexecuted to the order of the abbess, Giovanna da Piacenza, and are more\\nfitted for a \\\"Trianon\\\" than a convent. Minerva, Juno, Bacchus, and other\\nheathen gods and goddesses, with Cupids, and such-like profanities, are\\nmost charmingly arranged amidst a lattice pattern of flowers and\\nfoliage. At the period, the beginning of the sixteenth century, when\\nthis dainty scheme was painted, great licence and irregularities\\nprevailed in some of these conventual establishments. The abbess and her\\nnuns often entered into all the gaieties of the outside world and\\nindulged in the vices pertaining to it. In this case the wrath of the\\naustere Adrian VI. was visited on Giovanna and her flock, and S. Paolo\\nwas closed, the abbess dying within a month after this humiliation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGENOA\\n\\n\\nThe poet Tasso in his \\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\\" sings of the exploits of the\\ngreat commander of the First Crusade; and although Godfrey de Bouillon\\nhad little to do with Genoa, it was from its port that his fleet spread\\nsail in 1096 and disappeared over the southern horizon on its way to the\\nHoly Land. Nearly three years had passed in hard fighting before Godfrey\\nand his army found themselves before the walls of Jerusalem. Meanwhile\\nthe Second Crusade had started from Genoa, under the command of\\nGuglielmo Embrianco. He joined forces with De Bouillon, and the Holy\\nCity fell to their arms on July 15, 1099. Embrianco covered himself with\\nglory; and on his return, among other treasures, brought home the\\ncelebrated Sacro Catino, which he presented to his native city. This\\ndish of green glass is in the Cathedral. For centuries it was supposed\\nto have been fashioned from a single emerald, and tradition has it as\\nthe very dish, the Holy Grail, which held the Paschal Lamb at the Last\\nSupper.\\n\\nThe port of Genoa is very different now to what it was in those early\\ndays. Ships of all nationalities and every sort of build find refuge\\nbehind the numerous breakwaters which protect them from every gale that\\nblows. The Molo Vecchio is the oldest of these shelters, and built upon\\nhalf its length is an old quarter that is one of the fast-vanishing\\nslums of the city. On the sea-ward side of this mole the Mura della\\nMalapaga frowns on incoming craft, just as when in days gone by it bid\\ndefiance to the enemies of Genoa whose temerity had led them thus far in\\nattacks on the city. It is terminated by a grand sea-gateway of very\\nmassive construction. At the end of a subsequent extension the old\\nlighthouse rises, now well within the port. The house still stands in\\nthe old quarter in which Marco Polo was imprisoned after the defeat of\\nthe Pisans at the battle of Curzola, when he was taken captive. The Molo\\nNuovo stretches from the west side of the port near the tall Pharo, and,\\nrunning outwards, bends back and covers the Molo Vecchio from the\\nsoutherly gales.\\n\\n \\n\\nGenoa's quays present a busy picture with the endless traffic that makes\\nher the premier port of Italy. Strings of heavily laden carts drawn by\\nteams of great mules are continually passing to and fro. Cabs rattle on\\nthe pavements, their drivers cracking their whips, the horses'\\nheads decorated with the long tail feathers of the Amherst pheasant that\\ndance about to the music of the harness-bells. Groups of boys play pitch\\nand toss with coins, and still cry \\\"Croce e Griffo\\\" (\\\"Cross or\\nGryphon\\\"), a cry as old as the wars with Pisa. Itinerant pedlars pester\\nfolk to buy what no one seems to want. Under the arcades that face the\\nsea-front shops of all sorts exhibit everything the seafarer can\\npossibly require, and a lively business goes on in restuffing the\\nemigrants' mattresses with dry sea-weed or hay. Up, behind all this,\\nnarrow streets wind through the old parts of the city and form an\\nintricate maze wherein it is not difficult to miss one's way. Many of\\nthe houses here are seven, eight, or nine storeys high. All the day's\\nwashing -- and every day is washing day -- hangs out from the windows on\\nlong bamboos, or flutters from a cord stretched across the confined\\nthoroughfares. Fowls, in their inquisitive endeavours to find food, try\\nto satiate an appetite which is never satisfied. They are all scraggy.\\nDark courtyards at the bottom of these tall dwellings teem with\\nscreaming children and scolding women who are engaged at the fountain\\ntroughs with the washing. The ear-splitting cries of hawkers hasten\\none's footsteps down the steep descents, and one dodges out of their way\\nonly to lose oneself in vain attempts to leave the picturesque but\\nsqualid quarters of old Genoa.\\n\\nHowever fascinating these slums may be -- and they can hold their own from\\nthe painter's point of view with those in any other Mediterranean\\nport -- it must be acknowledged that the palaces for which Genoa is justly\\nfamous have hardly a rival. Historically the most interesting is the\\nPalazzo di S. Giorgio, which stands close to the quayside at the east\\nend of the Piazza Caricamento. It was erected in 1261 by Guglielmo\\nBoccanegra, Captain of the People, for his own residence. At his death\\nit was taken over as the government office for the registration of\\npublic loans, or compere , and named the Palazzo della Compere. In 1407\\nthe Banking Company which practically ruled commercial Genoa acquired it\\nas their headquarters, and its name was changed to that of the city's\\npatron saint. This bank was the oldest in the world. It originated after\\nthe Genoese had driven the Venetians out of Constantinople, and so\\ncrippled the trade of their great Adriatic rival that for a time they\\nwere masters of nearly all the Eastern commerce that flowed westwards.\\nThis increase in prosperity was to a great extent the cause of the\\nformation of a trading company, which accepted deposits and advanced\\nloans to others than its own members. Thus was founded a bank that\\ncarried on its business successfully until the last Doge of Genoa was\\nunseated and the mushroom Republic of Liguria proclaimed. The bank's\\nproperty was then confiscated, and Genoa, governed by time-servers and\\nplace-hunters, fell upon evil days.\\n\\nThe Palazzo has been much altered and restored, but retains some of the\\noriginal Genoese Gothic of Boccanegra's building. The Grand Hall on the\\nfirst floor contains many statues of the city's benefactors and\\nprominent men, and is an interesting epitome of their charities, which\\nare commemorated on tablets attached to each. Some of these statues are\\nseated, others are standing. The former are of men who purchased their\\nniche in this Temple of Fame by payment of one hundred thousand livres\\nto the state; while those who wished to be handed down to posterity at a\\ncheaper rate had to content themselves with effigies that for ever are\\non two legs. The building is now the Customs House, and so once more\\nmoney passes through different hands within its walls.\\n\\nThere are no other streets in Italy which can boast such an array of\\nnoble houses as the renamed Strada Nuova, now the Via Garibaldi, and the\\nVia Balbi. The Palazzo Rosso has a magnificent sala that has a roof\\ndecorated with the armorial bearings of the Brignole family and those\\nthey intermarried with. The Municipality is now lodged in the Palazzo\\nDoria Tursi. It has a grand fa\\u00e7ade flanked by open arcades with gardens\\non top, and was built for one of the Grimaldi by Rocco Lurago, a Como\\narchitect. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, and a bust of him\\nstands in the great hall of the palace, the Sala della Giunta. In its\\npedestal are some of his autograph letters to the Banco di S. Giorgio.\\nHis family came from Piacenza, but at the time of his birth his father\\nwas warden of the Porto dell' Olivella, one of the city gates. The\\nPalazzo Ducale, a huge building of mixed styles, was begun in the\\nthirteenth century but not finished until the sixteenth. The Palazzo\\nDurazzo has a grand vestibule and the finest staircase of all. The\\nPalazzo Doria, standing alone in a delightful garden which extends\\ntowards the harbour, is beautified by a good loggia with arcades. Many\\nare the palaces built by the great families of Genoa, the Spinola,\\nPallavicini, Balbi, Fieschi, Cambiasco, and others, as well as those\\nalready mentioned. They all contain large collections of pictures and\\nother treasures, and it can certainly be said that the old nobility have\\nleft a hall-mark on their city. The earlier buildings all possessed\\ntowers, and during the Guelph and Ghibelline feuds, when street\\nfighting was ever recurrent, these vantage positions were of immense\\nstrategic value -- it was so pleasant to put the opposing faction hors de\\ncombat by pouring boiling pitch and molten lead on to the heads below!\\nStreet fighting became at length such a nuisance to the peaceable\\ninhabitants that the order went forth that all towers were to be\\ndemolished, with one exception, the tower that Guglielmo Embrianco\\nattached to his house. This alone was spared. And it is due to the\\nveneration in which his name was held that it stands to-day the solitary\\ndefensive relic of Genoa's family feuds. It will be noticed that some of\\nthese palaces are faced, like the Cathedral, with bands of black and\\nwhite marble. This distinction was granted to the four noble houses of\\nDoria and Spinola, who were adherents of the Pope, and Fieschi and\\nGrimaldi, who took the Emperor's side in all wars.\\n\\nThe Cathedral is a good example of what may be termed Genoese Gothic. It\\nis dedicated to S. Lorenzo, and was consecrated by Pope Gelasius II. in\\n1118. The fa\\u00e7ade, separated into three unequal parts, is a good example\\nof thirteenth-century Gothic. The piazza on to which it faces slopes\\nsharply downhill -- all Genoa is up and down hill -- and the Cathedral rises\\nwell on its tier of steps. Bands of black and white form the exterior\\nwall of the whole building, and are effectively carried through the\\nrecesses of the portals. The centre porch has twisted columns, which are\\ncarried round the splay of the arch. The columns themselves alternate\\nwith others that are circular. The bases and pedestals are covered\\neither with carving or inlaid chequer and lozenge patterns. The two\\nflanking porches are similar, and assist very greatly to increase the\\npleasing effect of this somewhat elaborate treatment, which is\\nheightened by the two detached spiral columns on either side and those\\nthat terminate the fa\\u00e7ade at each end. In the tympanum over the central\\ndoorway is a figure of S. Lawrence lying nude on a gridiron. The fire\\nbeneath is stoked and kept alive by bellows handled by those who\\nassisted at his martyrdom. Above is a figure of the Almighty surrounded\\nby an angel, a lion, a peacock, and a deer. The detached column at the\\nsouth-west angle of the fa\\u00e7ade, seen in the illustration, carries a\\nfigure of the patron saint under a canopy. It rests on the back of a\\nlion; four smaller beasts of the same species encircle the base. The two\\nhuge couchant lions at either end of the steps are of much later date\\nthan these. From the south-west angle a fine turreted tower rises\\nupwards from the square, and with its copper dome forms a great feature\\nof the Cathedral as one walks up the Strada Carlo Felice. This\\nstreet is narrow and full of traffic, so much so that it is with\\ndifficulty one makes out the many mutilated tablets with Roman\\ninscriptions, built haphazard into the south wall of the Cathedral, and\\nthe canopied medi\\u00e6val tombs let in above.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe interior of the building is disappointing. One expects to find more\\nspace. A gallery at the west end, under which you find yourself directly\\nupon entering, forms a sort of atrium. It is supported by very massive\\nclustered columns which carry a good groined vault with heavy ribs. This\\nwas originally the cantoria , or organ-loft. Nine small bays on either\\nside separate the nave from the aisles. The single columns of the arches\\nare of red and purple marble from the renowned quarries at Tortosa, in\\nSpain. At each corner of the black marble bases, and touching the\\n torus of the column, the head of a bird or animal has been carved. The\\narches of the bays are pointed. Above them is an open triforium formed\\nby rows of small stunted arches that are carried by single and clustered\\ncolumns in banded black and white. The clerestory is of small narrow\\nsingle lights. The transepts are Renaissance, and the choir a mixture of\\nstyles.\\n\\nThe chapel of St. John the Baptist in the north aisle bears a\\nresemblance to that of \\\"Il Santo\\\" at Padua. Four slender carved pillars\\nsupport the entablature of good Renaissance design, on which are\\nexceptionally well arranged panels illustrating the saint's life.\\nFilippo Doria erected the canopy borne by porphyry columns which stands\\nover the altar. Under this, enclosed in an iron casket within a marble\\nark, on which are sculptured reliefs, are the remains of St. John.\\n\\nGenoa's fleet was homeward bound after one of the crusades, when,\\nthrough stress of weather, it took shelter in the port of Myrra, in\\nLycia. Hearing that a monastery close by contained the sacred remains of\\nthe saint, some of the bolder spirits of the fleet entered the church\\nattached, and, despite the protests of their co-religionists, carried\\noff in triumph all that remained of St. John. The relics were presented\\nto their own Cathedral of S. Lorenzo on arriving home. Here they have\\nrested ever since. No women are admitted into the chapel -- a prohibition\\nimposed by Pope Innocent VIII. in remembrance of the guilt of Herodias.\\nThe Treasury holds many things of value and interest besides the Sacro\\nCatino already described. Among them is a fine piece of Byzantine\\nmuch-bejewelled metal work known as the Cross of Zaccaria. It was\\ncarried off from Phocea by Ticino Zaccaria at the capture of that place.\\n\\nThe church of S. Bartolommeo degli Armeni contains the celebrated\\npicture on a cloth of the head of Christ. It was given to one of the\\nMontaldi, a noble Genoese family, by John Paleologus, Emperor of\\nConstantinople, in return for important services rendered. The legend\\nruns that Agbarus, King of Edessa, sent an artist, Annanias by name, to\\npaint our Lord's portrait. Annanias was no portrait painter, and failed\\nin the attempt. Our Lord then took a cloth, pressed it to His face, and\\nsent the impression back to the King. Leonardo Montaldo bequeathed it to\\nthe church in 1382.\\n\\nThe church of S. Donato, with its Romanesque tower that was built into\\nthe walls of Genoa forming one of its defences, dates from the eleventh\\ncentury. There are many other ecclesiastical fabrics in a place which is\\nfast losing all traces of old associations. Of the three sets of walls\\nbuilt at different times as the city slowly enlarged itself, the outer\\nalone bears any semblance of its pristine state, and modern Genoa, with\\nup-to-date improvements, is encroaching on these. But for all this its\\nsituation is superb, and it is in every way a bright and charming place.\\nTo those who enter by rail it is impossible to grasp the incomparable\\nposition the city occupies. Coming in along the Cornice road from the\\nwest, or that from the east, it can be better realised. But the best\\napproach is by sea. The long line of distant mountains that first\\nappears on the horizon gradually opens up, peak rises beyond peak, the\\nnearer hills become detached, valleys are revealed, and soon white\\nhouses may be discerned dotting the dark grey slopes. A long, broken\\narray of villages fringes the blue waters, gathering closer together as\\nland is approached. The mass of warm yellowish tint scintillating in the\\nbrilliancy of a Mediterranean sun takes shape, and the eye by degrees\\nseparates long terraced rows of buildings, church towers and domes from\\none another. The colour changes, and a heterogeneous combination of\\npink, white, yellow, and grey discloses the far-famed city rising tier\\nabove tier from the busy port that lies at its base. A whistle sounds,\\nthe rattling cable rushes out, the anchor plunges into the water, and\\nour ship is at rest. We are in the historic port from which the First\\nCrusade started, and from which not so long ago the patriot Garibaldi,\\nwith the friendly aid of Rubattino, sailed with his devoted thousand for\\nSicily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPISA\\n\\n\\nYou will not find in all Italy anything that is placed quite so well\\nwith an eye to effective grouping as the Baptistery, Cathedral, and\\nCampanile of Pisa. Nowhere does anything approach so near to the\\necclesiastical exclusiveness of an English cathedral close as the great\\nsquare of level green sward in which these three remarkable fabrics\\nstand. From one corner of the Piazza del Duomo part of the university\\nbuildings looks over the turf to the Baptistery. Hard by the seat of\\nlearning is the Porta Nuova, a fine gateway that pierces the old walls\\nof the city -- walls of an almost unpaintable red. Within the walls, on\\nthe other side of the Cathedral -- that is, to the north -- the Campo Santo\\nstands with bare fa\\u00e7ade and domed tower. Adjoining it on the east,\\nconventual buildings and the Palace of the Archbishop occupy the angle\\nof the Piazza. They face the Campanile. The one or two establishments\\nwhich come next as we continue our giro are full of little marble\\n\\\"Leaning Towers\\\" and other souvenirs which the tourist delights in. Save\\nfor the intrusiveness of these shops, there is nothing else in the\\nsurroundings of the vast square that detracts from the fascination of\\nthe wonderful group in the centre.\\n\\nThe Pisa of to-day cannot have changed much from the Pisa of two hundred\\nyears ago. It is true that, outside the old walls which encircle her, a\\nstraggling suburb is growing up, but within them noble palaces still\\nfront the River Arno, and others occupy the best positions in the city.\\nDwellings of the poorer classes line the narrow streets that connect the\\nwider and more spacious thoroughfares; they crowd thickly together, and\\nthe life of the pavements is the life of Italy as the tourist loves to\\nfind it -- the life of days gone by.\\n\\nIt has been said that all roads lead to Rome; in Pisa all roads lead to\\nthe Piazza del Duomo. In the centre stands the Cathedral; to the west of\\nit, the Baptistery; to the east rises the Campanile, or Leaning Tower.\\nPisa had well-nigh reached the zenith of her power when in 1063 her\\npeople resolved to commemorate a great victory over the Saracens by\\nbuilding a new cathedral. Ninety years later, having destroyed their\\nSouthern rival Amalfi, the Pisans commenced the Baptistery. The year\\n1174 saw the first stone of the Campanile laid. Thus in a little over\\none hundred years these three buildings, which mark so important an\\nepoch in Italian ecclesiastical architecture, were under construction.\\nThe advent of a man of unknown origin, Busketus, who designed the\\nCathedral, and whose epitaph is on one of its walls, heralded a new\\nphase in the art of the country. And although he adapted something from\\nthe Romanesque, this grand church of his was the precursor of a style\\nthat we find amplified, but not improved upon, in Ferrara, Pavia, Parma,\\nand, most notably of all, in the neighbouring city of Lucca. In the\\nhistory of Italian ecclesiastical architecture Pisa stands pre-eminent.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade of the Cathedral is very striking. The seven round arches of\\nthe blind arcade that form the lowest tier or base are continued round\\nthe entire fabric. The pedestals from which the columns of this arcade\\nspring rest on a bold but simple base-table that also encircles the\\nbuilding. These columns are round on the fa\\u00e7ade, the eastern apse, and\\nthe apse at the end of each transept, but become pilasters elsewhere.\\nThis extremely good arrangement does not break up the flat walls by too\\nmany obtrusive perpendicular lines. On the contrary, it enhances their\\nnoble length, and at the same time improves the semicircle of the apses.\\nThree bronze doors occupy three arches of the fa\\u00e7ade arcade. They are\\ngood examples of the seventeenth century. Crude mosaics in the tympanums\\nabove are a jarring colour note which one would willingly suppress. It\\nis otherwise, however, with the wonderful patterns of inlaid marble and\\nthe rich ornamentation of vine-leaves and floral forms, human heads and\\nanimals, that embellish the whole fa\\u00e7ade -- a character of decoration that\\nfinds a fitting terminal in the crockets on the gables and the figures\\nat their ends. Above the arcade four deeply recessed galleries fill the\\nwhole space of the fa\\u00e7ade. The lowest of these is on a level with the\\nclerestory lights in the aisles. The next is cut off at either end by\\nthe angle of the gable; the columns diminish in size with the slope of\\nthe aisle roof. The third is in a line with the clerestory of the nave,\\nand the topmost diminishes with the gable, which is carried beyond and\\nabove the ridge of the roof of the nave. The slender pillars that\\nsupport the arches of these galleries have wonderfully carved capitals,\\nand stand out in the brilliant afternoon sun from the deep shadow behind\\nwith marvellous effect.\\n\\nOne enters the Cathedral by the south and only door which escaped the\\ngreat conflagration of 1596. Its bronze panels are by Bonannus, who has\\nhanded down twenty-four episodes of Gospel history in the very ingenuous\\nstyle of his time. A lead-covered penthouse wards off the inclemency of\\nthe weather. The fine cupola which rises above the crossing is rather\\ndwarfed by the Gothic arcade and finials which surround its base. The\\ngrand effect of the Cathedral is due in a measure to the mellowing of\\nthe white marble, which the sun has seemingly baked to a beautiful warm\\nyellow and light red. On the north side, which is exposed to the bitter\\n tramontana wind from the Monti Pisani, the marble is blistered and\\nscored, and has acquired an ashen white that in this sunny land is not\\npleasant.\\n\\nThe interior is lofty. The effect obtained by the bands of black and\\nwhite marble of which the walls are composed is not so embarrassing to\\nthe eye as in Siena's holy fane. The nave is divided into ten bays; the\\ncolumns that support the round arches are magnificent monoliths of\\ngranite. These bays are carried in a continuous colonnade across the\\ntransepts and along their east and west walls. The aisles are double. As\\na consequence the forest of columns and arches is almost bewildering;\\nand if it were not for the fine proportions of the nave, the eye would\\nhave but little rest from a multiplicity of shadows and disturbing spots\\nof light. The pointed triforium, that is borne by the arches of the\\nnave, is continued across the transepts into the choir. The base of the\\ncupola at the crossing is elliptical, the length being east and west and\\nthe narrow sides north and south. The interior of the dome is covered\\nwith frescoes. The design of the six altars in each aisle is attributed\\nto Michael Angelo. The transepts are terminated by two apsidal chapels\\nwith mosaics in the semi-domes said to be designed by Cimabue. The same\\norigin can be more justly claimed by that which decorates the vault of\\nthe choir apse, and in which the great artist has depicted our Lord in\\nGlory, and S. John. The pavements of the choir and crossing are\\nexceptionally fine opus Alexandrinum . The huge bronze lamp that hangs,\\nswinging slightly, from the coffered and gilded roof of the nave is\\nsupposed to have suggested to Galileo the idea of the principle of the\\npendulum.\\n\\nTo the west of the Cathedral is Pisa's beautiful Baptistery. This\\nbuilding was commenced by Diotisalvi in 1153, and continued later on in\\n1278. The lowest storey is of the first mentioned date, and, like the\\nCathedral, is composed of a blind arcade, pierced in this case with\\nsmall round-headed windows. An open gallery circulates round the whole\\nedifice above this. Its columns support round arches that are surmounted\\nin piers by crocketed gables, pierced and cusped. A figure stands on the\\napex of each, while between every pair small open turrets thrust their\\npinnacles upwards. Above this gallery a series of windows with a similar\\narrangement breaks the base-line of the somewhat ugly pear-shaped\\ndome. As a prevention against the corroding influence of the salt sea\\nwinds, this dome is tiled on its south-west surface. The other portion\\nis covered with lead.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the centre of the interior, generally entered by the door opposite\\nthe west fa\\u00e7ade of the Cathedral, stands the font in which baby Pisans\\nhave for many generations been baptized. Like others, it is made for\\ntotal immersion. The walls which surround the appropriately \\\"waved\\\"\\nblack-and-white pattern of its floor are extremely beautiful. A\\ndelicately carved framework of marble encloses wonderful panels of\\ninlaid mosaic somewhat in the style of the pulpit in the illustration to\\n\\\"Salerno.\\\" Six small basins are let into the walls of the font and are\\nused now for the Holy Rite. Near the altar stands Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano's\\nmasterpiece. This hexagonal pulpit rests on seven slender columns of\\nmarble and granite. Some of these columns rise from their bases on the\\nbacks of lions, gryphons, and crouching human figures, thus in a way\\nrepresenting the dominion of the Word of God over creation. The\\nrectangular panels of the pulpit stage are beautifully carved in high\\nrelief. Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano's art, which bears evident traces of pagan\\ninfluence, is seen at its best in these panels of the Nativity,\\nAdoration of the Magi, Presentation in the Temple, the Crucifixion, and\\nLast Judgment. On the steps is a red marble pillar standing on the back\\nof a lion. It supports a small marble book-rest from which the Epistle\\nwas read. The desk on the pulpit itself is placed on an eagle, and was\\nused for the reading of the Gospel. Eight marble piers and eight granite\\ncolumns support the gallery beneath the dome. The whole of this noble\\ninterior is very light and airy, and Pisan mothers should have more\\ncause to hope for a bright future for their babes than their sisters in\\nParma, if a comparison is permissible between the bright cheeriness of\\nthe one place and the mystical gloom of the other.\\n\\nThe Campanile stands to the east of the Cathedral. Its base is some feet\\nbelow the restful green of the grass that covers the whole of the\\nPiazza. Four different architects carried out its erection during a\\nperiod that extended over nearly two hundred years. The base, another\\nblind arcade, was begun in 1174 by Bonannus; the fourth gallery was\\nadded by Benenato, the next two by William of Innsbr\\u00fcck, and the topmost\\nby Tommaso. The foundations were unfortunately laid in sea-sand, and the\\ntower settled at an angle that causes it to lean towards the south\\nthirteen feet out of the perpendicular. Galileo utilised this feature\\nfor experiments on the velocity of falling bodies.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Campo Santo, the dome of which is seen in the illustration to the\\nright of the Cathedral, is a quiet cloistered court on the walls of\\nwhich are an extraordinary series of frescoes. Those on the north wall,\\nby the Florentine, Benozzo Gozzoli, who was a pupil of Fra Angelico, are\\nthe most interesting. The Gothic arches and slender columns of the\\ncloister, and the well-kept garden-plot in the centre, out of which tall\\ncypress-trees rear themselves in ordered array, add much to the dignity\\nof this quiet spot.\\n\\nThe old Dominican basilica of Sta Caterina stands in a corner of the\\npiazza of the same name. Great plane-trees almost hide from view its\\nbeautiful fa\\u00e7ade, which, like that of the Cathedral, is gabled and\\narranged in galleries. Here, however, these are Gothic, with trefoil\\ncusped arches, developing in the topmost to cinquefoil, and giving an\\nair of elegance to the whole that is lacking in the Cathedral. A\\ncomparison of the two fa\\u00e7ades ends with the opinion that while in Sta\\nCaterina there is more grace, the Cathedral possesses more architectural\\nfitness for the design and proportions of the outline. Diotisalvi built\\nthe little octagonal church of S. Sepolcro for the Knights Templars, and\\nNiccol\\u00f2 Pisano erected the fine campanile attached to the church of S.\\nFrancesco. This tower is partly supported by consoles, or brackets,\\nwithin the church. The staircase runs up both inside and outside its\\nwalls.\\n\\nS. Stefano, which contains a S. George by Donatello, is close to the\\nCarovana in the Piazza dei Cavalieri. The piazza is thought to be the\\nold Roman forum. The Carovana was the Palace of the Knights of S.\\nStephen, and was another of Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano's works, and, although\\naltered later on by Vasari, is a fine example of Domestic architecture.\\nA double flight of steps leads up to the entrance-door, on either side\\nof which are tall windows. The fa\\u00e7ade is covered with frescoes and\\nadorned by six busts in niches of the first half-dozen Grand Dukes,\\nMasters of the Order. The roof projects far out, and the eaves,\\nsupported by well-carved cantilevers, throw a deep shadow down the front\\nof the palace. The Order of S. Stefano was founded in 1561 by Cosimo I.,\\nbut never distinguished itself amidst the Orders of Chivalry, and was\\ndissolved in 1869. A statue of the founder stands over a fountain in\\nfront of the steps.\\n\\nAmong the buildings that face the Arno, the Palazzo Lanfreducci, with\\nthe words \\\"alla Giornata\\\" and a chain pendant over the doorway, the\\nPalazzo Lanfranchi, where Byron lived, and the fine old fortress-tower,\\nthe Torre Guelfa, are the most notable in a city that at one time\\ndisputed with the mighty Genoa the rule of the Mediterranean. The\\nrivalry between these two maritime powers ended only when, after the\\ndisastrous battle of Meloria, the Genoese filled up the harbour of Pisa,\\nand she became no longer of any account as a naval base.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLUCCA\\n\\n\\nLucca is one of the most delightful little cities in the peninsula, and\\nits seventy-two churches, taken as a whole, the most interesting in\\nItaly. In matters ecclesiastical it is one of the oldest foundations in\\nthe country, and is reputed to have been the first place to have\\nembraced Christianity. The first bishop of Lucca, a disciple of S.\\nPeter, was S. Paulinus, and the long line of prelates who followed him\\nwere elevated to the higher dignity of Archbishop in 1726. The canons of\\nLucca are mitred, and the prelate has the privilege of wearing the\\ninsignia of a cardinal. It was always a Ghibelline city; even in the\\ndays of the Countess Matilda its inhabitants sided with the imperial\\nparty. When the attempt of Francesco Burlammachi to confederate the\\nTuscan cities failed, the Luchesi formulated the Martiniana Law, which\\npermitted only a few of the leading families to participate in the\\ngovernment. The result of this was a peace that prevailed for many\\nyears. But perhaps the most important historical event that occurred\\nwithin its walls took place in far earlier days than the sixteenth\\ncentury. The first triumvirate was formed when Julius C\\u00e6sar, Pompey, and\\nthe wealthy Crassus met and entered into an agreement whereby the power\\nwas divided between the three. More tangible relics of Roman occupation\\nare to be found where the amphitheatre once stood. The oval form of this\\nis well preserved in the extremely picturesque Piazza Mercato -- the\\nMarket Place. The wooden stalls of the market folk are practically\\nlittle huts with tiled roofs, that follow the lines of the amphitheatre\\nseats in gracefully curved alleys. In the Pinacoteca may be seen a print\\ndated 1785, in which the space is enclosed by a high wall. In the centre\\nis a tastefully laid out garden adorned with statues and rose bushes,\\naround which a horse race is in progress. Many columns used in the\\nerection of churches, and fragments of all sorts built into the walls,\\nare evidences of Lucca's importance among the colonies of ancient Rome.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe cathedral was founded as early as 573 by S. Frediano. The first\\nbuilding was close to the present Duomo, and was erected on the site of\\nthe church of S. Giovanni -- a very interesting Lombard edifice. The\\nsquare baptistery attached to S. Giovanni, with its original waved black\\nand white pavement and ancient square font, is well worthy of study.\\nPope Alexander II., who supplied William of Normandy with a holy banner\\nto assist in the invasion of England, consecrated the cathedral,\\nwhich, although much altered in the fourteenth century, still bears the\\nimpress of the architectural vogue of the tenth. The fa\\u00e7ade was added in\\n1204 by Giudetto. A portico of three unequal arches supports three tiers\\nof small arches. These form galleries diminishing in length as they rise\\none above the other to the horizontal cornice at the top. A magnificent\\nsquare campanile rises at the south end of the portico. Huge iron\\nbraziers stick out under its battlements at the four corners. It seems\\nto crush the arch that springs from one side of its base, out of all\\nproportion with the other two. This is very apparent from a distance,\\nand produces an uncomfortable feeling. But, when one makes the intimate\\nacquaintance of the portico and begins to examine the exquisitely\\ndesigned arabesques, &c., that decorate its arches, there is nothing but\\nadmiration for a mind that could play with stone as Giudetto has done in\\nthis case. The piers which support the three round arches have each four\\nslender columns. These are beautifully carved with all manner of\\nintricate patterns. On the central pier Eve is seen tempting Adam to eat\\nof the Forbidden Fruit. They are at the base of a tree, which growing\\nupwards spreads out branches whereon rest the early Kings of Israel and\\nthe Prophets. The exterior members of the arches are covered with\\nfinely cut foliage. The capitals are formed by the semi-Gothic classical\\nacanthus leaves of the period. Above the abaci of the capitals three\\nlions, crouching on consoles or brackets, grip in their thin claws a\\nsnake, a dragon, and a demon. Between two of the arches there is a good\\nstone group of S. Martin dividing his coat with a beggar by the use of a\\nbronze sword. The interior wall of the portico has a flat arcade of red\\nmarble columns and arches. Three doors give entrance into the cathedral.\\nTheir tympanums are decorated by well-executed reliefs. A double frieze\\nruns along the wall. On the lower portion figures, engaged in\\nagricultural pursuits, and the Signs of the Zodiac are cut; on the\\nupper, the life of S. Martin depicted in a series of panels. Some\\nexcellent examples of graffiti work decorate part of the wall. The\\ngalleries of the fa\\u00e7ade are like those that appear in the illustration\\nof the church of S. Michele.\\n\\nThe chief feature of the interior of the Duomo is a fine Gothic\\ntriforium. As in Pisa's Cathedral, this goes round the whole nave,\\ntransepts, which it also crosses, and choir, stopping short only at the\\napse. It is formed of double divisions of three pointed and cusped\\narches, which on the west wall are increased to groups of four each. The\\ntransepts are double. A massive pier in each carries the triforium\\nacross in a most effective manner. The nine bays on either side of the\\nnave have round arches. The fine roof, which is vaulted and groined, is\\nunfortunately spoilt by a very bizarre scheme of colour that is not\\nredeemed by the beautiful glass in the windows of the apse. Half up the\\nnorth aisle is an octagonal chapel built of marble, but almost entirely\\ncovered with gilt. It is known as the Tempieto, and contains the\\nvenerated relic of the V\\u00f3lto Santo, or Holy Face. It is supposed to be\\nan image of Our Lord, executed by Nicodemus, but is evidently a work of\\nthe eleventh century carved in two different species of wood. A much\\nfiner work of art is the beautiful tomb of Ilaria Caretti in the north\\ntransept. With her little dog, emblem of fidelity, at her feet, the\\nfigure of this gracious lady lies extended on a noble sarcophagus.\\nLittle winged putti surround its base, and it ranks among the best\\nproductions of the accomplished Jacopo della Quercia.\\n\\nOne of the most perfect Gothic arcades in all Italy is to be found in\\nthe church of Sta Maria della Rosa. It is situated close to the\\nArchbishop's palace at the east end of the cathedral. The spaces between\\nthe pointed arches and the top lights of the church are filled with\\nexquisitely carved cherubs peeping out from a mass of foliage. In the\\nPiazza dei Servi stands another small church, that possesses a carved\\nwooden roof not in any way inferior to the marvellous one that adorns\\nthe Badia in Florence. It was erected during the days when Lucca was a\\nrepublic, and one panel has the coat of arms of the city, with two great\\nleopards as supporters and \\\"Libertas\\\" for a legend.\\n\\nThe church of S. Frediano is close to the city walls. Its fine tower is\\nseen on the right in the illustration. Frediano, or \\\"Fair Hair,\\\" was a\\nson of a King of Ulster. Trained in Galloway, he travelled to Rome,\\nwhere he was well received by Pelagius I., and housed in the Lateran. He\\nbecame Bishop of Lucca in 565, and after the destruction of the first\\ncathedral by the Lombards commenced the erection of the present\\narchi-episcopal edifice. The church is full of interest, and contains\\nthe huge rectangular block of stone, computed to weigh three tons, which\\nthe saint lifted into a cart drawn by oxen, and which was to be used in\\nthe building of his cathedral. There is a fine circular font in the\\nchurch, with the Passage of the Red Sea carved on its panels by the\\nunknown Magister Robertus. Close to this, in the chapel dedicated to the\\npatroness of domestic servants, Sta Zita, is a good example of Giovanni\\nDella Robbia's work. Most of the church is built from the stones of the\\nRoman Amphitheatre. The altar is placed at the west end. The fa\\u00e7ade\\nis a very dignified composition, in which an Ionic colonnade and a good\\nmosaic of our Lord in glory play an important part. The grand\\n campanile , however, is its glory. This rises with tiers of open\\narches; but here they depart from the usual plan and increase in pairs.\\nOne tier of a single pair is the lowest; above are two of three arches,\\nand the next two of four arches. Two sides of this splendid tower are of\\ngreater width than the others.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the sketch a distant tower can be seen on which is growing a clump of\\ntrees. It is attached to the beautiful, red-brick Palazzo Borghi, one of\\nthe two fine palaces in Lucca built in the Venetian Gothic style. The\\nstory goes that the tower was built by Paolo Guigni, and that on its top\\nhe planted trees, under which he gave a series of banquets to show his\\nindifference for the enemy who were then besieging the city. A very\\npleasant walk leads us along under the grand limes and elm trees that\\ncompose the shady boulevards on Lucca's old walls. Many a good study of\\nroofs and distant mountains, in which the bare crags and rugged peaks of\\nthe Carrara range form a fine background, can be obtained from these\\nwalls; and many a beautiful peep through the foliage on to gardens below\\nwill reward the painter who strays out of the accepted route and makes a\\nsojourn in the bright little city.\\n\\nThe church of S. Michele has the most striking fa\\u00e7ade of any so-called\\nPisan-Gothic building. It is another work of Giudetto's, but is anterior\\nto that which he added to the cathedral. It is interesting to note how\\nthe fine colonnade at the base of S. Michele's fa\\u00e7ade was amplified in\\nthe later work of the cathedral by the portico which takes its place.\\nBetween the columns of this colonnade the closed lozenge-shaped lights,\\na familiar feature in the churches of the Pisan style, give a certain\\namount of solidity by their deep shadows. Above is an open gallery,\\nunder which is a marvellously intricate frieze of arabesques. Some of\\nthe pillars of this gallery are covered with inlaid marble, others are\\ntwisted or decorated with chevrons. On two of them repulsive-looking\\ndragons, snakes, and demons crawl downwards in high relief. At each end\\nis a cluster of four slender columns bound by knots. The capitals are\\nboldly cut, with heavy square abaci , from which bosses and floral work\\nprotrude. The corbels of the round-headed arches are composed of heads\\nof animals and demons, and the arches themselves are beautifully inlaid\\nwith geometrical designs. The frieze above is divided into panels of\\n graffiti , wherein lions, goats and birds, &c., are depicted in all\\nsorts of attitudes. The gallery above this is very similar, but with\\neven better pillars supporting its arches. It slopes upwards from\\nthe gable ends. Then comes the strange and airy feature of this\\nremarkable fa\\u00e7ade -- a false gable with two galleries ending in a pointed\\napex. Standing on canopied turrets at each end of the gable are angels\\nblowing bronze horns. Their robes are embroidered with inlaid marble and\\ntheir outspread wings are of bronze. On the acroteria , or pedestal, at\\nthe top, is a colossal statue of S. Michael with vestments adorned by a\\ngilded pattern. His wings are formed of separate bronze plates to\\ndiminish wind pressure, and make a good note of colour against a blue\\nsky. At the back of this false gable a flight of steps ascends from the\\nroof to the statue. As will be seen in the illustration, the colonnade\\nis carried along the other walls of the church and campanile . This\\nagain is a grand tower and like that of S. Frediano has two sides\\ngreater than the others. The interior of S. Michele is very simple, very\\nbeautiful and dignified, and quite unspoilt by any whitewash or colour.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are many other churches worthy of description if space allowed,\\nbut passing mention must be made of the earliest known work of Niccol\\u00f2\\nPisano. This is a relief of the \\\"Deposition from the Cross\\\" in the\\ntympanum of the arch of a side door at S. Martino. There is much else\\nto see in the compact and well-ordered little city that is situated so\\nbeautifully in a great bowl with mountains on every side. Much, too, to\\nwonder at in the legend S.P.Q.L. that the municipio still writes up on\\npublic notices as a reminder of the days when its inhabitants made the\\nlaws that governed the Republic of Lucca.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFLORENCE\\n\\n\\nAlthough Florence has no doubt an Etruscan origin, her first historical\\nrecord dates from the time of Tiberius. During his reign the inhabitants\\npresented a petition to the august presence praying him to prevent the\\ndiversion of the River Clanis into the Arno. Through many subsequent\\nvicissitudes she rose from an obscure beginning to be the centre of the\\nArt of the civilised world. This was accomplished in the days when\\nFlorentines were not ashamed of \\\"soiling the fingers with trade,\\\" and\\nwas due to the good taste and patronage of her wealthy merchant\\ncitizens, who took the keenest interest in the development of their city\\nas the home of all things cultured. The Florence of to-day is rapidly\\nbecoming as cosmopolitan as London, and as a consequence has a growing\\ntrade in the manufacture of \\\"antiques.\\\" But so great is the charm of\\nthis wonderful city that every year sees an addition to the long list of\\nthose, who coming from other lands, either rent a flat within the walls\\nor occupy a villa outside. It is a charm that never dies -- indeed,\\nbecomes intensified. Bitter winds may whistle through the draughty\\nstreets, and tearing down the Arno from the mountains howl across its\\nbridges; the end of the \\\"merrie\\\" month may still see deep snow on the\\nhilltops, yet no one who has once been in Florence, even under these\\nundesirable conditions, but wishes to come again. And this charm -- what\\nis it? Is it that the city stands in the midst of a garden, a veritable\\nbed of roses? Does it lie in her classic river along the banks of which\\nDante oftentimes wandered? Is it because Cimabue, Giotto, Leonardo,\\nMichael Angelo, Raphael, the della Robbias, Fra Angelico, and Donatello,\\nall were at their zenith in Florence? Go to the Pitti and Uffizi and\\nmarvel at their powers. Is it in her glorious buildings, her magnificent\\npalaces, and the traditions of her great families -- the Medici,\\nBuondelmonti, Uberti? In all of these surely lies a charm that nothing\\ncan dissipate! Yes, in all these; but still there is a something beyond\\nthem, a subtle, indefinable spell that enwraps the senses and captures\\none body and soul in this Queen of cities.\\n\\n \\nFLORENCE]\\n\\nOf all the great Florentine trade-guilds, the Wool-weavers were the\\nrichest, and the illustration shows a restored corner of their Hall with\\nthe redecorated altar behind the iron grille. On the opposite side is\\nthe Gothic church of Or S. Michele. Originally the site was\\noccupied by a corn market, in the loggia of which stood the figure of\\na much-worshipped Madonna. Walls were built round the loggia and the\\nmarket removed to the storey above. The niches on the exterior of the\\nchurch contain statues of the patron saints of the numerous\\ntrade-guilds. Among them was a fine S. George, the patron saint of the\\nArmourers Guild, by Donatello. This is now in the Bargello, having been\\nreplaced by a cast. The figures of SS. Mark and Peter were gifts from\\nthe linen merchants and the butchers, and are by the same master-hand.\\nThe best stained glass in Florence decorates the fine Gothic windows of\\nthe church. Their very elaborate tracery is cleverly designed to get the\\ngreatest effect from the top light -- so necessary in the narrow and dark\\nstreet. The Misericordia Brethren may be seen in the sketch carrying\\nout one of the self-imposed tasks for which they receive no payment\\nwhatever. The Compagnia della Misericordia was founded by Pier di Luca\\nBorsi in the year 1240. Men of all grades of society belong to the\\nOrder, and once a year attend a service in the cathedral, when they take\\na pledge to abstain from profane language. They nurse the sick, carry\\npatients to the hospitals, and the dead to their last home. Every one\\nwho knows Florence is familiar with the hurrying footsteps of the\\nblack-robed figures as they proceed on their errands of mercy. The\\nheadquarters of this noble self-sacrificing Order are on the left in the\\nillustration of the Campanile.\\n\\nThose who recollect Florence in the eighties will remember that the\\npicturesque old quarter, the Mercato Vecchio, occupied the site of the\\nfine Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele. This pestilential plague spot, into\\nwhich it was hardly safe to venture, was done away with in the years\\n1890-95. When the work of demolition was begun it was found to be so\\nfoul and insanitary that no house-breakers were allowed to touch a\\nsingle stone until three months of stringent disinfection had elapsed.\\nThis is one of the very few clearances that have taken place in the\\nheart of the city since the fifteenth century, and the thought of it\\ncarries one back to the days when that great reformer, Fra Girolamo\\nSavonarola, set Florence on fire with his fierce disputations. A great\\nbronze disc with a medallion portrait of the ascetic monk marks the spot\\nin the Piazza della Signoria where he ended his days at the stake with\\ntwo brave companions. In his little cell in the monastery of S. Marco\\nthere are two pictures which present us with the details of the tragedy.\\nSave for the flight of steps that has taken the place of the platform\\nwhere his judges are seen sitting, the Palazzo Vecchio, wherein he was\\ncondemned, is the same to-day as it was then. It is the grandest secular\\nbuilding in Florence, and this is saying a great deal. Built of huge\\nblocks of rough stone, it was commenced in 1299 by Arnolfo di Cambio,\\nand is a testimony to the splendid construction of the fourteenth\\ncentury. The top storey projects on brackets from the walls, which stand\\nfour-square. Under these brackets are the Ghibelline and Guelph arms;\\nthe former is a white lily on a red ground, the latter a red lily on a\\nwhite ground, quartered with the crescent of Fiesole. The present arms\\nof Florence, so familiar all over the city, are a red fleur-de-lys with\\ntwo sprays on a white ground. The battlements that surmount this storey\\nare square-shaped Guelph, while those of the great tower which dominates\\nthis part of the city are the swallow-tailed Ghibelline. This fine\\nlandmark is three hundred and seven feet high, and has a projecting\\ngallery underneath the loggia with which it terminates. The palace was\\nbuilt to accommodate the eight Priori, who, under the presidency of the\\nGonfaloniere, ruled Florence. It remained the seat of government for\\nover three hundred years until Cosimo de Medici, having usurped the\\npower, removed his court to the Pitti Palace.\\n\\nFrom Michelozzo's beautiful cortile , which one enters first, a noble\\nstaircase ascends to the Salone dei Cinquecento. It was in this\\nmagnificent hall, where a statue of Savonarola is now placed, that he\\nwas tried and condemned. There are other fine rooms in the Palazzo\\nVecchio, but nothing approaches the beauty of the little cortile \\nbelow. Nine columns of grand proportions bearing round arches support\\nthe arcade that forms part of the courtyard. Each column has a different\\ndesign above the fluting which runs half-way up them all. The delicate\\nlow relief of these exquisitely modelled devices, some of which are\\ngrape clusters, others children with garlands, heads, and classic\\nornamentation, is so slight, that the effect on every column obtained by\\nthe light which pours down from high above makes each one seem a simple\\nmass of half-tone thrown strongly out against the deep shade of the\\narcade beyond. It is an architectural masterpiece of what the painter\\ncalls \\\"values.\\\" A delightful fountain in the centre of the cortile , by\\nVerrochio, adds to the sense of repose that one experiences when the\\nglare and noise of the piazza are left behind.\\n\\nThe south side of the Piazza dei Signoria is taken up by the Loggia dei\\nLanzi -- a good specimen of the domestic Gothic style of Italy. Three\\narches form the base that supports the lower storey. A rich balustrade\\nand projecting cornice adorn the top. Benvenuto Cellini's \\\"Perseus,\\\"\\nand \\\"Judith and Holofernes\\\" by Donatello, are among the statuary placed\\nin the loggia . The building was erected for the use of the Priori, and\\nfrom it they witnessed all great spectacles that took place in the\\nsquare. It derives its name from the guard of foreign soldiers that\\nCosimo I. established in quarters hard by. To the east and running south\\nis the great Ufizzi Palace, which contains some of the finest art\\ntreasures that Florence possesses.\\n\\nDante's house stands in the Via Dante, to reach which one leaves the\\npiazza at the north-east corner, passing the back of the Badia on the\\nway thither. The Badia was the Church of the Benedictines, and is built\\nin the shape of a Greek cross. It is notable for the grandest coffered\\nwooden roof in Italy. Just above the frieze which runs round the top of\\nthe walls, a fine series of well-carved brackets carries the first\\nportion of the roof -- a flat space beautifully ornate with good\\narabesques. Deep-set bosses in recesses circulate round the carving\\nbeyond this, until they centre in a recess so deeply set that it almost\\nbecomes a miniature dome. Heavy brackets support and carry the outward\\nthrust. The miniature dome takes the form of a Greek cross, and from it\\nthe whole design springs in a very symmetrical manner. Such a massive\\nwooden ceiling speaks volumes for the constructive art of the day.\\n\\nOpposite the Badia stands the Bargello, or Palazzo del Podest\\u00e0. In its\\ncourtyard is the well-known outside staircase that, sketched \\\"to death,\\\"\\nis to be seen represented in almost every shop in Florence. The palace\\nis the national museum, and among its grand collections the work of the\\ndella Robbia family can best be studied. Florence is such a\\ntreasure-house in every way that one might wander on from church to\\npalace, and museum to gallery for a year, and then be barely acquainted\\nwith what lies behind its walls.\\n\\nFlorence, too, was the home of the Renaissance, and although Giotto\\npreceded the great master of early Renaissance, Brunelleschi, his famous\\nCampanile is more classic in style than Gothic. The accompanying sketch\\nwas made towards twilight when a day's heavy rain had cleared off. The\\ngeneral impression one carries away of the beautiful bell tower is that\\nof a white mass rising majestically above the congested traffic of the\\nnoisy street below. The year 1334 saw the commencement of Giotto's\\ndesign. His death, however, took place when the work had but reached the\\nfirst storey of the five. Taddeo Gaddi and Francesco Talenti carried it\\non, and to the latter are due the windows of the upper storeys. Small\\nlozenges in the lowest depict the Development of Civilised Man from the\\nCreation. Above these is a series of sculptures, and in niches yet\\nhigher up are the Prophets, Evangelists, Patriarchs and Sibyls. Giotto\\nintended to add a spire to the heavy balcony which projects from the top\\nof the last storey. The whole structure is cased in white, pink and\\ngreen marble, and thus harmonises with the exterior of the Duomo which\\nit adjoins. Had the spire been added, the campanile would not have the\\nrather top-heavy appearance it has when seen from some distance away.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe cathedral is a building that stands on the site of a very early\\nchurch dedicated to S. Salvadore. Appropriately named Sta Maria del\\nFiore, the construction was commenced in 1298 from the designs of\\nArnolfo di Cambio. Many hands worked for nearly two centuries at\\nArnolfo's designs, and continually altered them. On the whole, whatever\\nits merits, the building cannot be said to be an architectural success.\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade, completed as recently as 1887 by Emilio di Fabris, is\\nperhaps the most fortunate feature. The Gothic windows on the north side\\nare certainly very beautiful. The mass of the huge dome seen from the\\ncorner of the Via del Orviolo piles extremely well above the domes of\\nthe apse and south transept. But most of the good points of the exterior\\nare lost in the \\\"noisy\\\" pattern of the different coloured marble panels,\\nwhich, like those in Giotto's campanile , encase the whole building.\\n\\nThe interior is vast and empty, and the dull grey colour that covers the\\nwalls is almost worse than whitewash. Four immense bays constitute\\neither side of the nave. The heavy piers that support the arches would\\nbe better without the ugly caps above the capitals. There is a gallery\\nabove with pointed arches, and four circular windows on each side form\\nthe clerestory. The best portions of the interior are the two aisles.\\nThe glass in the windows of these, although almost obscured by dust and\\ncobwebs, is very lovely. The interior of the great dome was painted by\\nVasari and Zuccaro, but reveals no beauties of design. The High Altar is\\nsituated beneath this, and the choir stalls which are around are\\nenclosed by a high marble screen. Under the altar, in a fine bronze\\ncasket, lie the remains of S. Zenobius, who was bishop of Florence at\\nthe end of the fourth century. The apse of the cathedral consists of\\nfive chapels; the middle one is dedicated to the saint. Behind the High\\nAltar is a fine, though unfinished Piet\\u00e0 , the last work commenced by\\nMichael Angelo. He intended it for his own tomb, but died before it was\\ncompleted. There are many things of value in both the Sagrestia della\\nMese, the beautiful bronze doors of which are by Michelozzo, and the\\nSagrestia Vecchia, over the door of which is one of Lucca della Robbia's\\nvery best works. It is true that with oft-repeated visits the vast\\nbuilding grows on one, but, however much its size may impress, it cannot\\nbe called a landmark in Italian architecture.\\n\\nClose by these two structures and due west of the cathedral fa\\u00e7ade, in\\nthe middle of the Piazza del Duomo, stands the Baptistery. Its eight\\nwalls were covered with marble by Arnolfo di Cambio some time after the\\nwest door had been removed and the rectangular space for the altar\\nconstructed inside. The three doors that remain are, with the lintels,\\nsuperb examples in bronze of the Renaissance period. The twenty panels\\nwhich depict the life of S. John the Baptist on the south door are the\\nwork of Andrea Pisano. At the base of one lintel two nude male figures\\ncarry children at a vintage festival; at the base of the other are two\\nfemale figures, amidst a cluster of corn stalks. Andrea Pisano has\\nalmost excelled himself in the exquisite foliage which grows up both\\nposts. Above the door is a bronze group in which S. John kneels to\\nreceive the stroke from the executioner's sword, while an angel holds up\\na hand shielding the sight from her eyes. The East door by Ghiberti\\ncontains prophets and sibyls in niches between the ten panels that\\nillustrate episodes of the Old Testament. The third door is by the same\\nhand. Its twenty panels of Gospel history are surrounded by exquisite\\nfoliage, amidst which snails and beetles crawl and bees suck honey,\\nwhile here and there the fascinating head of an impudent little frog\\npeeps out.\\n\\nThe interior does not compare with Pisa's Baptistery. Granite columns\\nwith gilt Corinthian capitals support a triforium gallery composed of\\nround arches with Ionic pillars. The square lights of the clerestory,\\nwhich alternate with mosaic panels, are behind another gallery that\\nleans inwards. From this springs the mosaic-covered dome. Up to the year\\n1571 a large font stood in the centre, directly under the opening in the\\nmiddle of the dome, which until then had no cupola. It was moved in that\\nyear by Francesco I. for the baptism of his son! An act of sacrilege\\nwhich speaks volumes for the absolute power of the autocratic grand\\ndukes of those days.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is very interesting to examine the almost interminable series of\\nportraits that hang on the walls of the long passage connecting the\\nUfizzi and Pitti Palaces. This passage crosses the river, and may be\\nseen in the illustration of the Ponte Vecchio, with its square barred\\nwindows looking up the river. It is above the jewellers' shops -- a\\nfavourite haunt of the tourist -- that hang so airily like spiders over\\nthe water and crowd the old bridge. Amongst this extraordinary\\ncollection of portraits of the Medici and their collaterals, may be\\nseen one of our own Charles II., Eleanor of Toledo, wife of Cosimo I.,\\nand Catherine de Medici, whose sly eyes, cunning and cruel mouth in no\\nway belie her character. All the reigning grand dukes are here, and not\\none of them can be said, if these are faithful portraits, to have a\\nreally open honest countenance. To judge by their physiognomies, they\\nruled by brute force and craft. However, there are bronze figures of two\\nof the race who in metal appear more like noblemen than these travesties\\nin paint. Indeed when one sees the gilded figures of Ferdinand I. and\\nCosimo II. standing over their tombs in the Capella Medicea, we feel\\nthey were men of the great race that made Florence famous throughout the\\ncivilised world.\\n\\nThe Capella Medicea stands at the back of the fine church of S. Lorenzo.\\nIt is a gloomy octagonal building with a dome, and lined throughout in a\\ndull and heavy scheme, with most costly marble. The interior of the dome\\nis painted and gilded. Six members of the great family lie here in their\\nsarcophagi. The remains of two more rest in the Sacristy. But it is not\\nin connection with any reverence for the scions of the Medicean House\\nthat our footsteps are drawn hither. No, the little sacristy is crowded\\nall day with those who come to see the work of Michael Angelo. Beneath\\nthe statue on the tomb of Giuliano de Medici are the colossal figures of\\nDay and Night. These two wonderful creations are surpassed by Dawn and\\nTwilight on the tomb of Lorenzo, a grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent,\\nand father of Catherine de Medici. His well-known seated figure is on\\nthe tomb. More simple than these is the beautiful, but unfinished, group\\nof the Virgin and Child. The little altar, too, is a masterpiece of\\nsimplicity by the same great hand.\\n\\nTo the church of S. Lorenzo is attached the celebrated Laurentian\\nLibrary, which contains the most valuable collection of MSS. in Italy,\\nthe Vatican alone excepted. Among these is the seventh-century MS. of\\nthe Vulgate Bible, written by Ceolfrid Abbot of Jarrow. At the corner of\\nthe Piazza de S. Lorenzo is a fountain surmounted by a statue of\\nGiovanni delle Bande Nere, leader of the \\\"Black Hand,\\\" whose son became\\nthe Grand Duke Cosimo I. Opposite this fountain is the magnificent\\npalace of the Medici, the Palazzo Riccardi. From its beautiful\\n cortile , with reliefs by Donatello, a fine staircase leads up to the\\nbig hall that has a ceiling painted by Luca Giordano. The palace was\\nbuilt by Michelozzo for Cosimo, who lavished his wealth to such an\\nextent that the title he acquired of Pater Patri\\u00e6 was perhaps no\\nmisnomer. By the same profuse expenditure his grandson Lorenzo became\\nknown as Lorenzo il Magnifico. The family of Medici appears in the\\nchronicles of Florence towards the end of the twelfth century; but the\\nfirst member to lay claim to any distinction was Salvestro, who took a\\nprominent part in the revolt of the Ciompi in 1378. The leader of this\\ninsurrection was Michele di Landi, a ciompo or wool-carder. Giovanni,\\nthe banker, amassed the great wealth which enabled his son Cosimo to\\ncarry out his ambitions.\\n\\nApart from the Capella Medicea the church of S. Croce may be looked upon\\nas the Westminster Abbey of Florence. In it is the tomb of the great\\nmaster who created \\\"Dawn and Twilight.\\\" The monument to Michael Angelo\\nBuonarotti is the work of Vasari. Alas! one cannot but lament that the\\nirony of Fate has ordained the resting-place of genius should stand\\nagainst a wall on which are painted red curtains! Not only red curtains,\\nbut a hideous red canopy with gold tassels drawn aside by vulgar little\\nabominations in the shape of fat cherubs. For once, one longs for the\\nwhitewash brush. The cenotaph of Dante is placed close to the beautiful\\nRenaissance tomb of Leonardo Bruni. The recumbent figure of the\\ndiplomatist lies stretched out on a slab borne by eagles, and represents\\nreal repose in a marvellous manner. The red brick floor of the church\\nis almost covered with tomb slabs, some still in good relief, others\\nworn flat. Among them is that of John Ketterick, Bishop of Exeter, who\\ndied in Florence in 1419 when on an embassy for his sovereign.\\n\\nThe airy interior of S. Croce is very fine. Slender octagonal columns of\\na russet hue bear pointed arches with Italian-Gothic capitals. The\\naisles have wooden roofs. The glass in the windows is good; and the\\nchapels at the east end and in the transepts are covered with most\\ninteresting frescoes by Giotto, Taddeo and Agnolo Gaddi and others. S.\\nCroce is still served by the Black Conventuals, a sub-order of S.\\nFrancis. The cloisters attached to the monastery were designed by\\nArnolfo di Cambio, and through them one reaches the Capella Pazzi, one\\nof Brunelleschi's best buildings. The fine portico with its colonnade of\\nIonic columns has a frieze of cherubs attributed to Donatello. The\\nentrance to the cloisters is from the Piazza S. Croce, the buildings on\\nthe south side of which are typical of old Florence. The upper storeys\\nof these grey-brown walls overhang and are supported by huge wooden\\ncantilevers. One house, the Palazzo di Niccolo dell' Antela, is covered\\nwith allegorical paintings by Giovanni da S. Giovanni, and on it is a\\nwhite marble disc that marked the goal in the game of calcio . The\\nPiazza, which is one of the largest in the city, was in bygone days the\\npublic games-ground.\\n\\nAnother fine church of one of the great preaching Orders is S. Maria\\nNovella, which stands in the piazza of the same name, not far from the\\nrailway station. The fa\\u00e7ade is a very clever adaptation by the genius\\nwho planned the transformation of \\\"Il Tempio\\\" in Rimini, Leo Battista\\nAlberti. In S. Maria Novella he fitted Renaissance ideas to the earlier\\nGothic construction of the arcades and lower portions of the buildings.\\nLike all Dominican churches the nave is disproportionately large, built\\nalways thus to accommodate the great congregations who flocked to hear\\nthe sermon; and so that all could hear, the pulpit was placed nearer the\\nwest than the east end. In the sixteenth century Vasari altered the\\ninterior and took away the marble screen that divided the conventual\\nfrom the public part of the church. It stood where a couple of steps run\\nright across the church at the fourth bay of the nave. This is lofty,\\nwith a groined vault and pointed arches. The transepts have lateral\\nchapels and the choir is very shallow. One of these chapels is that of\\nthe Rucellai family, whose coat of arms with an inflated sail has been\\nused with as good an effect by Alberti in the decoration of the fa\\u00e7ade\\nas the Malatesta coat at Rimini, where it will be remembered the little\\nelephants play so important a part in his scheme. In this chapel is the\\nfamous panel, the so-called Cimabue's \\\"Madonna,\\\" which some critics\\nattribute to Duccio da Siena. Speaking personally, however, I failed to\\ndiscover the greenish undertones that are a feature in Duccio's work.\\nThe story tells us that when the picture left Cimabue's studio it was\\nhailed by the people in the streets with great admiration and holy\\nfervour. Attached to the west wall of the church are the cloisters. The\\nChiostro Verde, so called from the greenish colour of its frescoes,\\ncontains the Spanish chapel. One can here spend a very instructive\\nmorning examining the fine mural decorations that cover the walls. The\\nChiostro Grande is now a military gymnasium; but the upper part is\\ndevoted to the Institution for Deaf Mutes and the Society for Repressing\\nBeggars. Many useful articles can here be purchased that are made by the\\nvery poor. Tourists, make a note!\\n\\nThere is another useful institution, and one perhaps that is much better\\nknown. The Spedale degli Innocenti, or Foundling Hospital, which admits\\ninfants without any inquiry, and when the children are old enough boards\\nthem out in peasant families, where they are trained to earn a\\nlivelihood. The hospital is the work of Brunelleschi. In the spandrils\\nof the loggia are the medallions of infants in blue and white by\\nAndrea della Robbia, reproductions of which hang on many a wall\\nthroughout the civilised world.\\n\\nNot far off is the monastery of S. Marco, the cloistered courts of which\\nonce ran red with the blood of the monks. Fra Angelico's intensely\\nreligious frescoes in the monastic cells surely helped to inspire the\\nbrethren to defend their home by force of arms against those who were\\ndetermined to eradicate every vestige of their beloved Savonarola. A few\\nrelics of this great democrat are still to be seen in his cell. The\\nwriting-desk he used, a book of commentaries in his own minute hand, his\\ncrucifix and other personal objects, remain as silent witnesses of the\\nfierce struggles in a mind brought to the lowest depths of despair and\\nwell-nigh prostrate when the last act was accomplished in the Piazza\\ndella Signoria.\\n\\nOf the many great Florentine palaces the two that hold the incomparable\\ncollections of pictures are the best known. The Uffizi stands on one\\nside of the river, the Pitti on the other. Emulating the lavish\\nexpenditure of their rivals, the Medici, the Pitti family employed\\nBrunelleschi and Fancelli to erect a building which should outshine all\\nthe Medicean palaces in Florence. So much was spent on it that\\neventually the family were ruined, and Fate, that so often plays with\\nthe over-ambitious, ordained that their rivals should step in and\\npurchase the huge building. The Grand-dukes of the Medici took up their\\nresidence in the building, part of which is now the Royal Palace. From\\nthe beautiful Boboli Gardens at the back, a very good view is obtained\\nof the cathedral and Giotto's Campanile, with Fiesole and the mountains\\nin the north rising beyond. But if we wish for a comprehensive\\nimpression of Florence as she lies in the valley of the Arno, we must\\nascend the hill on the top of which the church of S. Miniato al Monte\\nstands. Beneath the cypress trees at our feet the classic stream,\\ncrossed by its famous bridges, winds away in the direction of the Monti\\nPisani. The great dome of the Cathedral seems almost out of proportion\\nwith the lesser landmarks around it. More than ever does one wish to see\\nthe spire that Giotto designed to finish his grand bell-tower. And as\\nthe eye wanders over roofs and embattled walls, the mind goes back to\\nMedicean days, ignoring for once the utilitarian vandalism that has\\ncarried the noisy tramcar through the intricacies of the maze below us\\nin desecration of the memorials of a great age.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPERUGIA\\n\\n\\nIn the vicinity of Perugia many remains of Etruscan civilisation have\\ncome to light, and part of the old Etruscan city walls still stand. On\\ntop of the huge blocks of stone of which they are composed one may also\\nsee the defensive superstructure added by the Romans, and above this the\\nred brick of a later date. Wandering in the older parts of the city,\\nwhere the houses are terraced on the steep hill-slopes and the narrow\\nstreets, often burrowing under them, wind sinuously in and out, one is\\ncarried right back without an effort into medi\\u00e6val times. Neither does\\nit require any effort to picture the sanguinary faction fights between\\nthe great Perugian families, the Oddi and Baglioni. Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano's\\nlast work, the figures on the fountain by the steps of the Cathedral,\\nand the unfinished wall of the building itself, are to-day just as they\\nwere in the fifteenth century when these same steps ran red with blood\\nin the accomplishment of the diabolical plot which wiped out a whole\\nfamily, save one. So tired of these conflicts were the more law-abiding\\nPerugians after this deed, or so surfeited with blood, that the might\\nof the Church Militant was called in to put an end to all distracting\\nfeuds. The advent of Pope Paul III. was looked upon at the time as a\\nreal deliverance; but the crafty Pontiff, knowing the hornet's nest he\\ncame into, was sagacious enough to build for himself a fortress-palace\\nin an impregnable position. This, the Rocca Paolina, stood partly on the\\nground at the end of the Corso Vannucci where a big hotel is now, and on\\nthe garden space in front of it. The visitor to Perugia can never forget\\nthe incomparable view from the wall of this garden; nor wonder, when he\\nlooks over the veritable precipice beneath it, that the Baglioni, whose\\npalace was demolished to make way for Paul's fortress, could hold in\\nterror the rest of Perugia from the security afforded by their own\\nwalls. Perugia is like an octopus, with a central hill on which the\\nCathedral is situated, and from which long feelers stretch out in all\\ndirections. A statue in a public garden at the end of one of these\\nfeelers, or, more correctly speaking, promontories, commemorates the\\nexpulsion of the Swiss Papal Guard by General Fanti in 1860. The city\\nthen joined the newly formed kingdom of Italy and made an end of the\\nChurch's supremacy by demolishing the Rocca Paolina.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is rather extraordinary that when the strife between the nobles of\\nPerugia was at its height art was in the most flourishing condition.\\nFashion, or perhaps the hall-mark of the \\\"gentleman\\\" of those days,\\ndictated that he should patronise art. We see this in the records of all\\nthe great families of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and\\nhowever bloodthirsty and revengeful they were amongst themselves, they\\nhad this one great merit. And so we find that while the Oddi were\\nslaying the Baglioni, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Raphael, and Signorelli\\nwere all at work in Umbria, where one half of the people seem to have\\ngiven up their lives to bloodshed and the other half to the\\ncontemplation of sweet-faced Madonnas and paintings of religious\\nfervour.\\n\\nIn the middle of this ancient city stands its Cathedral, but, alas! with\\nno redeeming architectural feature, either outside or within. The\\nexterior reminds one of the tale of the man who, having made a little\\nmoney, built a house like a cube with windows, telling his friends that\\nwhen he could afford it he would have the architecture put on. All that\\ncan be said about its outer walls is that if the design of pink marble\\nquatrefoil slabs had been carried out and finished, it would have looked\\neven worse than it does now.\\n\\nThe bronze statue of Pope Julius III. on the south fa\\u00e7ade was erected by\\nthe subscriptions of the people to show their appreciation for the\\nrestitution of those privileges of which they had been deprived by the\\nbuilder of the Rocca Paolina. It is placed on one side of a door, and on\\nthe other side the pulpit, put up for the use of S. Bernardino of Siena,\\nwho came to Perugia to preach peace and allay the feuds of the nobles,\\nis a sort of pendant.\\n\\nTen octagonal columns, painted to represent marble, stand in the nave\\nand support the Gothic groined vaulting which springs from gilded\\nCorinthian capitals. The first bay on the south side is enclosed by a\\ngood iron grille. Within is the Capella del S. Anello, containing\\nPerugia's most sacred relic, the wedding-ring of the Blessed Virgin.\\nThis was filched one day from Chiusi, the pleasant little town where one\\nso often changes trains on the way from Rome. To prevent a repetition of\\nthe theft it has, since its arrival in Perugia, been enclosed in a\\nreliquary that can be opened only by fifteen different keys kept by\\nfifteen different citizens. The Capella de S. Bernardino occupies the\\nopposite bay of the north aisle. The choir is a five-sided apse, round\\nwhich are the canons' stalls of good intarsia work. The central of the\\nthree windows is almost filled by the organ loft, and the choir gallery\\nis above the stalls. In the north transept a little door in an almost\\nhidden angle of the wall opens out into the cloisters. Of the two\\ncourts the inner, with two galleries, is a very picturesque and quiet\\nspot. Creepers come trailing down the walls, flowers in boxes add a\\ntouch of colour, and the cooing of doves gave one the idea that here at\\nany rate, in the precincts of a sanctuary, was a haven of rest from the\\nbrawling world outside. The Cathedral library has a great treasure in\\nthe possession of the Codex of St. Luke of the sixth century. It is\\nbound in silver and written in letters of gold on purple-coloured\\nvellum -- a splendid combination.\\n\\nNot many of Perugia's churches can rejoice to-day in the preservation of\\ntheir original state. Those attached to the disendowed monasteries are\\nnow mostly barracks, and others have been restored or propped up as a\\nconsequence of intermittent earthquakes that developed great cracks in\\ntheir walls. Coming through the Porta Susanna, the lowest part of which\\nis Etruscan masonry put together without any cement, one leaves the\\nancient city behind, and, turning to the right, sees across the vacant\\nPiazza de S. Francesco the gem of Perugia's ecclesiastical architecture.\\nThe little oratory of S. Bernardino stands adjoining the ruined church\\nof St. Francis. The lovely fa\\u00e7ade of this tiny building is by Agostino\\nDucci, who built it in marble and terra-cotta. Its two doors are\\nenclosed by a rounded archway, in the tympanum of which is a figure of\\nour Lord in Glory with two archangels. S. Bernardino is beneath. Around\\nhim are many angels who sing to the accompaniment of the musical\\ninstruments on which they play. Beyond the angels are two rows of\\ncherubims with heavenly faces. The ground colour of the tympanum on\\nwhich all these delicately modelled bas-reliefs stand was evidently at\\none time a gorgeous blue and gold. It has faded to a beautiful \\\"broken\\\"\\ncerulean. The jambs of the portal are green serpentine, and contain\\nthree figures of angels on each side. They carry implements of husbandry\\nand agriculture. Six panels on the fa\\u00e7ade have more angels with musical\\ninstruments. Arabesques cover the posts of the portal, and laurel is\\ncarved on them as well. Four terra-cotta saints occupy niches; under\\nthese are scenes in higher relief illustrating events in the life of S.\\nBernardino. In one he is depicted saving a boy from a watery grave. The\\ndelicate pink and warm opaque yellow of the terra-cotta, the white\\nmarble and green serpentine, and the exquisite note of blue, with traces\\nover all of faded and half-obliterated gilding, make this gem one of the\\nbest pieces of external colouring to be met with in Italy.\\n\\n \\n\\nOne finds a church situated at the extremity of each of Perugia's\\npromontories. The Romanesque church just outside the S. Costanza Gate is\\nwell worth a visit, if it be only to look at its eastern portal.\\nSlender, twisted pillars of marble support the architrave, on which is a\\ncentral figure of Christ seated in a circle. On either side are the\\nsaint with a dove, and a lion with a gryphon. Elegant pilasters are\\ncarried from the steps up above the architrave. They are carved with\\nquaint trees growing out of monsters, and support goats and other\\nanimals. Leo XIII., when Bishop of Perugia, restored the fa\\u00e7ade, but\\nvery judiciously left this portal alone. Crosses and other Christian\\nsymbols in terra-cotta are the fruit of the restoration. On to all\\nthese -- in fact, wherever they could find a purchase -- the mason-bees have\\nsettled and built their nests. The drowsy hum from the busy little\\ncolony adds much to the pleasure of a reverie as one sits on the steps\\nof the doorway and looks across the vale to Assisi, baking in the sun,\\nand to the scarred mountains beyond.\\n\\nThe never-completed church of S. Domenico, which Giovanni Pisano\\ndesigned as a Gothic building, contains a grand Gothic monument by that\\nmaster. The figure of Pope Benedict XI., who died by eating poisoned\\nfigs, lies on his sarcophagus behind curtains which two charming figures\\ndraw aside. The fine Gothic canopy of the tomb is supported by twisted\\ncolumns inlaid with tesser\\u00e6 in the same style as the pillars in the\\nportico of Lucca's cathedral.\\n\\nThe Benedictine church of S. Pietro would have been a very impressive\\nbasilica had not every inch of its walls been covered by poor frescoes\\nand huge canvases of mediocre paintings. The nave is simple, with a good\\ncoffered roof. In one of the aisle chapels there is a very beautiful\\naltar by that delightful artist, Mino da Fiesole; and the tabernacle\\nover the high altar is a good example of marble work. It is surmounted\\nby bronze figures standing at the angles round the base of its little\\ncupola. The magnificent reading-desk is also worthy of note. It rests on\\na table with good carved panels illustrating events in S. Peter's life.\\n\\n \\n\\nOne of the finest Domestic Gothic fa\\u00e7ades in Italy is that of the\\nPalazzo Pubblico. A grand doorway of clustered and twisted columns\\nornamented with arabesques gives on to the Corso Vannucci. Above the\\nportal are the city's three protectors, SS. Lorenzo, Ercolano, and\\nCostanza. By their sides and overhanging the pavement, on brackets, are\\ntwo huge gryphons holding a sheep and a calf. Within the building are\\nthe Municipal Offices, and on the third floor the pinacoteca , on the\\nwalls of which hang some of Perugino's best work. The fa\\u00e7ade, which\\nfaces the Piazza del Duomo, has a fine flight of steps leading to\\nan entrance on the first floor. Above this are two more gryphons in\\nbronze and a lion. Depending from the gryphons is the great chain and\\nbar which were captured from the Sienese. Three fine arches support a\\n loggia , outside which is a pulpit, removed hither from the demolished\\nchurch of S. Salvatore. This side of the Palazzo is the oldest part of\\nthe building, preceding in construction that which is in the Corso\\nVanucci by fifty years. A third part, that was added in 1429 for the\\nBankers' Guild, is known as the Collegio del Cambio. The great hall\\ninside is decorated with very good examples of Perugino's brush, and has\\na marvellous ceiling covered with arabesques and medallions by his\\npupils. Carved stalls and benches of walnut wood with intarsia work,\\nand fine doors, complete an ensemble which is one of the best examples\\nof an early Renaissance interior.\\n\\nThe old Piazza del Sopra Mura, so called because the buildings on one\\nside were erected on the Etruscan walls, has been renamed the Piazza\\nGaribaldi. A statue of the hero may be seen in the illustration. On the\\nright of the sketch, built on the walls, is the Palazzo del Capitano del\\nPopolo, at present the Assize Court. Its Gothic fa\\u00e7ade has a good porch\\nand a ringheria , or balcony. The piazza is one of the best \\\"bits\\\" in\\nthis quaint old city, and when filled with market folk haggling over\\nbargains under their umbrellas is a typical Italian scene in a typical\\nItalian setting.\\n\\nThere are not many places in Italy that boast so fine a view as Perugia\\ncan from the garden where once stood the Baglioni's palace. In winding\\nlines directly beneath one a road, buttressed up by great blocks of\\nmasonry, now leads downhill to the station. To our left is a mat of\\ngrey-brown roofs, out of which rise hundreds of curiously shaped\\nchimneys. Heavy stones keep some of the roof tiles in place. A necessary\\nprecaution, for, although these are laid three deep, a storm of extra\\nviolence is apt to whisk them away by scores. Glimpses of delicious\\nwalled-in gardens and old conventual courtyards nestling behind high\\nwalls break the colour of our brown mat with relieving patches of green.\\nBell towers and a spire or two rear themselves out of the harmoniously\\ncoloured network and catch the early sun like beacons. Tortuous alleys\\nappear and disappear amidst this delightful chaos, and little figures\\nlike ants may be seen labouring up the steep slopes. A sudden jump in\\ncolour from brown to green and the eye has leapt a thousand feet or more\\nto the vast and fertile plain beyond. Shadows thrown by fleecy clouds,\\nwith which from our height, we seem to be on a level, chase one another\\nover the emerald carpet. Little hills, covered with trees, appear as\\nflat as the plain below. Dark cypresses and pines cluster round the\\nfarms and homesteads that punctuate the landscape with white dots. Long\\nthin ribbons of the same colour tell where the main roads run to Assisi,\\nto Foligno, to Rome or Orvieto. As the eye travels on, the emerald\\nmerges imperceptibly into green of a blueish tinge. Hills twenty miles\\naway rise in a purple mass under the shadow of the clouds above. But\\nwhat a perfect canopy the sky is! The sun pierces the well-ordered\\nbattalions that are moving across it from the west, and with long,\\nstraight rays strikes the windings of the river that runs on to the\\nEternal City and flows out to sea. Far away, through the yellow haze\\nthat throws the purple hills into such bold relief, are shadowed forms\\nrising tier above tier in the mystery of distant sunlight. The snowy\\ncrests of Italy's central chain toss themselves up to heaven, hardly\\ndistinguishable from the farthest mass of the marching hosts of the sky.\\nYes, truly an unforgettable view, and one which the Baglioni of old,\\nfrom their castle windows, must have drunk in with pride. Well nigh as\\nfar as their eye reached the country owed them allegiance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nASSISI\\n\\n\\nOf all the wonderful hill towns of Italy, Assisi can claim a kind of\\npre-eminence in saintship and monasticism. The delicate finger of time\\nhas touched lightly and lovingly the little medi\\u00e6val fortress which gave\\nto the world S. Francis and S. Chiara. One might say that every stone in\\nthe place is saturated with the memory of the former and sweetened by\\nthe recollection of the saintly woman who outlived him many years. The\\nlife of S. Francis of Assisi is one of the most enthralling tales in the\\nhistory of the saints. He, who was the son of a rich cloth merchant, and\\nup to the age of twenty-four had led a gay and vicious life, has left to\\nhumanity one of the greatest examples of charity, humility and chastity\\nthat the world has ever seen.\\n\\nAs one approaches the quiet little place, the first thing to attract is\\nthe great church of S. Maria degli Angeli, built over the Porziuncula.\\nThis, a small chapel, was presented to S. Francis by the Benedictines of\\nMte Subacio, and is the scene of the closing years of his life and his\\ndeath. A fine altarpiece by Andrea della Robbia in the north transept\\nshows the saint receiving the stigmata , or wounds of our Lord's\\nPassion. Pope Pius V. raised the cupola that is directly over the spot\\nwhere S. Francis expired. The charming little garden where the saint\\ncultivated his plants and medicinal herbs adjoins the sacristy; and\\nthere still flourish in it the thornless roses of the legend. Two years\\nafter the death of S. Francis, the immense building that rises on a\\nmassive substructure was commenced by Gregory IX. The great convent and\\ntwo churches, one above the other, that seem from below as solid as the\\nrocks beyond, were erected over the saint's grave. S. Francis, when\\ndying, expressed a wish to be interred outside the city walls; but his\\ndisciples, so we are led to believe, carried his body up secretly two\\nyears later, and placed it in a sarcophagus, which was found imbedded in\\nthe rock in the year 1818. It had lain there inviolate for six hundred\\nyears.\\n\\nThe lower church, which one enters by a Gothic porch, is very dark. This\\nis emphasised if the sun happens to be very brilliant. By degrees,\\nhowever, the wonderful ultramarine used in the decoration of the groined\\nroof asserts itself, and what at first seemed utter blackness unfolds\\nimperceptibly into an extraordinary scheme of colour. The costly blue\\nwas presented by Hecuba, Queen of Cyprus, whose tomb is in the church.\\nThe great porphyry vase in which it was brought thither is there too.\\nChapels raised six steps above the floor of the nave take the place of\\naisles; and their windows, filled with stained glass, do not help to\\nmitigate the darkness. The High Altar stands at the inter-section of the\\nnave and transepts. Immediately beneath is the rock containing the\\nsaint's remains. The altar itself is a huge slab of stone brought from\\nConstantinople. It rests on twenty slender columns that form a sort of\\narcade with trefoils and mosaic spandrils. The tour compartments of the\\nvault above are adorned with some of the finest of Giotto's work. They\\nare known as the Poverty series, and Chastity, Obedience, and S. Francis\\nin Glory.\\n\\nA fine vestibule at the west end of the nave fronts the Piazza\\nSuperiore, and carries the fa\\u00e7ade of the upper church. This is smaller\\nthan the lower church by the width of the side chapels, and consists of\\na nave, short transepts, and apse. The nave is decorated by a once noble\\nseries of frescoes by Giotto of the life of S. Francis. They are much\\ndamaged by injudicious restoration, and comparing them with other works\\nby the same master-hand, it is open to question whether much of the\\ncolour from his brush is now on the walls. Above them is the almost\\nruined work of Cimabue. Alas! that such masterpieces should have been\\nso neglected.\\n\\nOn the way to the upper town one passes through the old Roman Forum, now\\nthe Piazza Grande. In the square stands the Palazzo del Capitano, to\\nwhich a fine tower is attached. Further on, as one climbs the ascent,\\nthe street opens out into the Piazza Rufino, at the end of which the\\ncathedral is situated. Dedicated to the first bishop of Assisi, who\\nsuffered martyrdom in the year 286, the building was commenced in 1140.\\nThe fine fa\\u00e7ade has three portals, elaborately carved in low relief, and\\nthree very good round windows. Grotesque figures of birds and beasts are\\nset on brackets near the centre window, and occupy other places on the\\nfa\\u00e7ade. The interior was restored and altered at the end of the\\nsixteenth century, and is in no way remarkable. It contains, however,\\nthe font in which S. Francis was baptized, and two good statues of white\\nmarble, one of S. Francis, the other of S. Chiara.\\n\\n \\n\\nAssisi is distinctly a sun-baked city; and built of local warm-coloured\\nstone, it looks almost on fire when the rays of the setting sun light up\\nits walls, its roofs, and its towers. Thus does the illustration depict\\nthe cathedral's fa\\u00e7ade and Romanesque campanile . In the piazza stands,\\non a pedestal, the bronze statue of the saint which replaced that\\nwhich is inside the building. The street under the houses on the\\nleft leads to the Roman theatre, and on the right one proceeds to the\\nchurch of S. Chiara. The mummified body of S. Clare still rests in the\\ncrypt; and the Crucifix which spoke to Giovanni Bernardone in the church\\nof S. Damiano is in the north transept. To this crucifix was due the\\nchange which transfigured the life of the young man, and gave to the\\nworld one of its greatest saints. Giovanni was nicknamed Francesco by\\nhis father, who had an extensive trade connection with France, and a\\nname given in jest has become one of the most remarkable in the history\\nof the Church. The country round Assisi is full of beautiful subjects\\nfor pen and pencil; and long meditative rambles are within reach of the\\npoorest pedestrian. The spirit of S. Francis dominates all. It is not\\nfar to the carceri , the little dug-out rock chambers that he at first\\ninhabited with his few followers; and the gorge through which one climbs\\nto reach them is that where he was one night attacked by robbers, who\\nfinding their victim clad only in a hair shirt, beat him and left him\\nfor dead in a drift of snow. The life of S. Francis has ever been an all\\nabsorbing one for the painter's art. One of the favourite subjects\\nconnected with it is his marriage with the Lady Poverty. The vows he\\ntook of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience were demanded from all his\\nfollowers. His rule once established, his disciples were known as the\\nFrati Minori. When preaching to the poor he often exposed to view a\\nrepresentation of the birth of Christ which he carried about, and it was\\nover this pres\\u00e9pio , or manger, that the first Christmas carols were\\nsung.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIENA\\n\\n\\nSiena, the Ghibelline, at one time always at war with Florence the\\nGuelph, no longer disputes with her ancient rival the glory of being the\\nforemost of Tuscan cities. But, though she no longer does this, pride in\\nher Roman origin has never ceased. She still retains the S. P. Q. S. as\\nthe head-line of municipal notices; and the she-wolf and twins are to be\\nfound sculptured on many a column that adorns some of her little\\ncourtyards as well as on odd corners about her walls. Nine gates, one of\\nwhich boasts a barbican, admit the stranger to her dark up-and-down-hill\\nstreets. She possesses many fine palaces. She might have possessed the\\ngrandest Gothic cathedral in all Italy had funds permitted its\\ncompletion. As it is, it is one of the most remarkable and is adjoined\\nby one of the most beautiful campanile in the country. If the visitor\\nbraves the heat of August, she can show him the very best survival of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times in her celebrated Palio , or horse-race, that takes\\nplace every year in the great piazza. In her streets you will hear the\\npurest Italian spoken. Her women, as the month of May comes round, don\\nthe most becoming of straw hats, and her people are justly famed for\\ntheir courtesy. Fortunately for some of us, the tourist hurries on to\\nFlorence or Rome. But for him who loves the repose and personal charm of\\nan old-world city, Siena will always open her arms and gather him in an\\nembrace that will hold him for ever enchanted by the fascination of a\\ndelightful memory.\\n\\nAlmost in the centre of the city and occupying a space on the top of the\\nhighest hill, Siena's cathedral is to-day a fragment only of what its\\nbuilders hoped to erect. The west end of the original nave is away at\\nthe end of the piazza to the south of the present south transept. The\\npresent nave was built as one of the transepts, and when its size is\\nrealised the grand scheme that was never completed can be judged. The\\nbuilding was begun in 1229 and the dome over the crossing finished\\nthirty years later. About sixty years after this the scheme to construct\\nthe huge nave was commenced. It was only owing to a terrible plague\\nwhich carried off, it is said, eighty thousand people, that this was\\nabandoned. The tracery of a very beautiful Gothic window remains at the\\nunfinished west end, to make one marvel at the splendid proportions of\\nthe intended fabric.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe cathedral, of which a fine view is obtained from the church of S.\\nDomenico on the opposite hill, is approached from the Piazza del Duomo\\nby twelve marble steps. The topmost which forms the platform in front of\\nthe fa\\u00e7ade is inlaid with graffiti designs in black and other colours.\\nThree crocketed gables crown Giovanni Pisano's fa\\u00e7ade. Their surface is\\ncovered with modern mosaics. Under the centre gable, surrounded by a\\nsquare frame of Gothic niches filled with half-length figures of saints,\\nis an immense round window devoid of all tracery, but filled with good\\nglass. A flat black band of marble frames the niches. Elegant turrets\\nwith crocketed pinnacles surmounted by saints are on either side of this\\ngable. The two other gables are flanked by towers, each with a solid\\nturret. The purest piece of architecture is the gallery which is between\\nthe centre and these two side gables. Below runs a classic frieze\\nseparating the upper from the lower part of the fa\\u00e7ade. The columns and\\npilasters of the three portals are of white and red marble; they are so\\nheavily laden with elaborate sculpture of beasts, birds, and foliage\\nthat they seem to lose their raison d'\\u00eatre and no longer support\\nanything. The capitals of all these are formed of elongated acanthus\\nleaves, and might be likened to a field of waving maize. It is very\\ninteresting to note, by the classic work which Pisano introduced\\neverywhere on the fa\\u00e7ade, how difficult it apparently was for him to get\\naway from the tradition of his country's classic architecture when\\ndesigning a Gothic fa\\u00e7ade.\\n\\nThe whole front is covered with white marble statues perched on every\\navailable place. Gargoyles, like chevaux de frise , protrude from every\\nangle and corner. On the brackets over the four main columns of the\\nporches are two horses, a winged lion, and a lion regardant . The whole\\nof the front lacks repose, a condition which is intensified by the black\\nand white inlay of the flat surfaces. The centre gable overlaps the\\nportal beneath, and the apexes of the two side gables are beyond the\\nmiddle of the two side portals. This is a good arrangement, and assists\\nthe balance of the composition, which is well restrained by the deep-set\\ngallery and dark shade of the flanking towers.\\n\\nThe pointed windows of the south aisle and transept are canopied. On top\\nof each of the buttresses between them is a white marble figure. The\\nmagnificent campanile rises above the chapel close to the south door.\\nLike the rest of the cathedral it is banded in black and white marble.\\nThe lowest of its seven courses is constructed with a solid exterior,\\nthe next is pierced by an arch, the third by two arches, and so on,\\nincreasing until at the top stage there are six arches. Four turrets\\nwith slender spires finish off the corners at the top, and a good\\nhexagonal spire rises from the centre. The dome is supported by an open\\ngallery. The idea of a central tower never seems to have appealed to the\\nItalian in his Gothic work; even at Milan the spire of the cathedral can\\nhardly be said to rise from a tower.\\n\\nThe interior of the cathedral, by reason of the very decided black and\\nwhite bands of marble, although mellowed with age, is not restful to the\\neye. The nave consists of five bays on each side. The aisles have round\\narches. The transepts are double and of unequal length. All the windows\\nare pointed with the exception of the two round ones at the east and\\nwest ends. The clustered columns of the nave are of very good\\nproportion; above them is a heavy frieze. Between the numerous consoles\\nof this is a series of terra cotta busts of all the Popes. Executed at\\none time, they are, like the medallion portraits of the Pontiffs in S.\\nPaolo fuori at Rome, not authentic likenesses. What gilding there is, is\\naway up in the roof and on the bosses in the soffits of the arches, but\\nit is old and not really obtrusive. The same may be said for the\\nstar-spangled blue vault. The illustration shows the cold light from the\\nnorth transept window striking Niccol\\u00f2 Pisano's beautiful pulpit, in\\ncontradistinction to the warm rays that penetrate this noble fabric\\nthrough the clerestory windows of the nave. Arnolfo di Cambio and\\nNiccol\\u00f2's son Giovanni had a share in the execution of this splendid\\nwork, which may be ranked next to the pulpit in the Baptistery at Pisa.\\nThe pavement of the whole cathedral is composed of graffiti in\\ncoloured marble pictures. To preserve this unique pavement the\\nauthorities have wisely covered the nave and aisles with a wooden floor;\\nand except during the month of August and on great festivals, when this\\ncovering is taken away, the only portion in the lower part of the church\\nexposed to view is that under the dome. This is railed off.\\n\\nThe six niches at the top of the clustered columns that support the\\ncupola are filled with colossal metal figures. On bronze brackets, fixed\\nto each pier of the choir, are thirteenth-century bronze figures of\\nangels holding lamps. One admires the good taste that has always left\\nthese bronzes ungilded. The same praise may be accorded in the case of\\nthe grand bronze candlesticks on the high altar, and the magnificent\\ntabernacle by Lorenzo di Pietro which rests on it. The only note which\\nreally jars is the crescent of hideous gilded cherubims that partially\\nsurround the east window. The choir stalls, which were exchanged for\\nthose in the convent of Mont' Oliveto Maggiore, nineteen miles out of\\nSiena, have extremely good intarsia work of architectural and\\n\\\"still-life\\\" panels.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the north aisle is the Piccolomini chapel, with a very fine\\nRenaissance wall of carved arabesques. In niches stand statuettes, in\\nthe execution of which Michael Angelo had a hand. The celebrated\\nLibreria Piccolomini adjoins this. Its walls are decorated with the\\nfrescoes of the life of Pius II., a scion of this noble House. In the\\ncentre of the library stands the beautiful group of the Three Graces, a\\nGr\\u00e6co-Roman work which Raphael drew from and studied.\\n\\nThe baptistery, S. Giovanni Battista, is below the east end of the\\ncathedral on a steep hill-side. Its exceptionally good Gothic front by\\nGiacomo di Mino was never completed, and for this reason, as will be\\nseen in the illustration, the roof of the cathedral has a barn-like\\ntermination at this end. The interior is a sort of transverse nave with\\ntwo piers supporting a groined and vaulted roof. The frescoes of the\\napse, though much faded, still retain some of the rich colouring with\\nwhich two Brescian painters decorated them. The font is a very beautiful\\nexample of Giacomo della Quercia's work, and is adorned with six bronze\\ngilt panels, one of which is by Donatello. Small figures occupy the\\ncorners, and are by the same master-craftsman.\\n\\nAmong the many great names on Siena's roll of fame, the two saints\\nCatherine and Bernardino are perhaps the best known. A little way beyond\\nthe margin of the first picture of this chapter, to the left, is the\\nhouse where the former first saw light. The last of twenty-five children\\nborn to Giacomo Beninsca and his wife, her childhood was marked by an\\nextraordinary ascetic devotion overwhelming all other feelings, so that\\nat the age of sixteen she entered the Order of S. Dominic. The series of\\nchapels which the Casa Beninsca is now turned into will be for some,\\nfrom their sacred associations, the most interesting spots in all the\\ncity. The house has a charming loggia and cortile , but otherwise no\\narchitectural features worthy of note. On the hill above, and behind the\\nspot from which the sketch was made, is the church of S. Domenico, in\\nwhich S. Catherine worshipped; it is a huge building in the style of all\\nDominican churches, with a great nave, no aisles, a shallow choir and\\ntransepts. Her life was one replete with visions. In the chapel at the\\nwest end S. Catherine took the veil. Little could she have known at the\\ntime, that she was ordained some future day to be the prime factor in\\nrecalling Pope Gregory XI. from Avignon to Rome.\\n\\nS. Bernardino was the son of the Governor of Massa Maritima, a Sienese\\ntown not far from the coast opposite the Isle of Elba. He joined the\\npreaching Order of S. Francis at the age of twenty-two, and was one of\\nthose who always drew immense crowds to listen to his eloquent words.\\nWhen in Florence he made a bonfire of evil books and vanities, thus\\nforestalling one of Savonarola's great revolutionary acts. So great was\\nhis influence considered to be that, while in Perugia, the great bell\\nwas always tolled during his occupation of the pulpit. Care of the poor\\nwas one of his chief aims, and he established the \\\"Monte di Piet\\u00e0,\\\" for\\nlending money on small pledges, to save those in want from the heavy\\nhand of the usurer.\\n\\nOf all the palaces in Siena that which stands on the south side of the\\nCampo, the Palazzo Pubblico, is the most famous. Nearly every one who\\nreads these lines must be familiar, through photographs or otherwise,\\nwith the magnificent campanile \\\"del Mangia\\\" -- a title that originated\\nwith a figure, nicknamed the \\\"Glutton,\\\" that at one time struck the\\nhours on its bells. The illustration gives a view of the tower seen\\nthrough the Arco di S. Guiseppe. It is three hundred and thirty-four\\nfeet high, and is built of brick with a machicolated stone cap and\\nbell-turret above. At its base stands the Cappella della Piazza, a very\\nbeautiful open loggia , built to commemorate the city's deliverance\\nfrom the great plague that was instrumental in causing the proposed\\nenlargement of the cathedral to be given up. The Palazzo itself consists\\nof a huge central square block with Sienese battlements -- square with\\nhatched mouldings. A couple of turrets rise in three storeys above the\\ntwo side wings of the block. The lowest storey of the building is of\\nstone, the others of that delightful red brick which charms the\\npainter's eye, and is peculiar to Siena. All the windows of the palace\\nare pointed, with a flat containing-member outside the three lights of\\neach. Two good courtyards give entrance by stairways to the upper floors\\nof the building, which is now used for judicial business. Almost\\nopposite, across the Campo, is the Palazzo del Governo, formerly the\\npalace of the great Piccolomini family. It contains the treasures of\\nSiena, the state archives; and in front of it stands the Font Gaia.\\n\\nIn the Via del Capitano, leading into the Piazza del Duomo, is the\\nPalazzo Squarcialupi. This thirteenth-century building was, in the old\\ndays, the official residence of the Judges of Appeal and the Captains of\\nWar. The Loggia dei Mercanti was built in the fifteenth century for the\\nuse of the City Fathers who assembled here in their business capacity of\\nmerchants to judge trade disputes. So widespread was the fame of this\\nimpartial tribunal that foreigners often brought their differences\\nbefore it for adjustment. The palace is now known as the Casino dei\\nNobili. Many fine residences line the tortuous and shady thoroughfares,\\nand others form parts of the different squares. Most of them have iron\\nrings and brackets let into their walls similar to many of the\\nFlorentine palaces and those already mentioned in the chapter on\\nBologna.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is not, however, so much in the individual buildings that the charm\\nof Siena lies, nor in the long line of painters whose works are on the\\nwalls of the Spedale in the Piazza del Duomo, in the Accademia delle\\nBelle Arti, and elsewhere. Rather is it in the personal and intimate\\nnote of the beautiful old city taken as a whole. For even the sojourn of\\na single week will captivate and make one feel as if he belonged to\\nSiena, and Siena to him. It may be that the wheeled traffic, which can\\nfollow but two or three distinct lines through her streets, shuts off in\\nsilence large areas of the city, and that the visitor is left more to\\nhimself and his reveries than is the case in most Italian towns.\\nWhatever it be, it is difficult to define, but the more one knows Siena\\nthe more whole-heartedly does one give oneself up to her charm.\\n\\nIs there anything quite the same, quite so peaceful, and yet so full of\\nhistory's wars, as the view from the pleasant gardens of La Lizza? Pass\\non to the walls of the Fortessa at the end of \\\"the Lists,\\\" or old\\ntilting-ground, and what a beautiful landscape unfolds itself!\\nUndulating ground, covered with vines and orchards, carries us into a\\nmiddle distance of cypress and pine-clad hills. These stretch away into\\nan opalescent haze, out of which to the north and east rise the peaks of\\nfar-distant mountains. To the west but one great mass soars above the\\nsea of golden mist -- Mte. Amiata, always different yet always the same. A\\nsolitary mountain, once seen ever remembered; a mountain one can love.\\nWhat a land of sunshine and pastoral beauty it is! Always at its best in\\nspringtime before the summer's sun has laid its grip on the red earth\\nand scorched it sere, and when the showers of April freshen and draw\\nfrom the warm soil that scent of Mother Earth, which nothing man has\\never made can equal and which no money can buy.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nORVIETO\\n\\n\\nOrvieto, yet another of the wonderful hill towns of Italy, is quite\\nunlike any of those with which this book has hitherto dealt. It has an\\nabsolutely insular position, due to its situation on top of an isolated\\ncrag of dark volcanic rock which rises out of the wide valley of the\\nriver Paglia. The rock, which crowns the steep slopes of a hill, goes\\nupwards a sheer precipice on three sides. On the fourth, the old road\\ncircles and winds in and out of olive groves and orchards, until, having\\nclimbed the ascent, it finally enters the city in a bold curve close to\\nwhere the funicular rail from the station terminates. The principal\\nentrance is the Porta Maggiore at the other end of the rock. It is a\\ngateway hewn out of the solid tufa and built across a very narrow\\nnatural gorge. Two other gates pierce the walls. One, at the east end,\\nis close to the old Fortessa -- now converted into a charming garden. Like\\nan old eagle that in his declining years cannot trust his wings for far\\nflight, this grim old city, built of black lava, broods over the sweep\\nof country below. Very few places in the country occupied so\\nimpregnable a position.\\n\\nOn the northern slopes of the hill there has been unearthed in a\\npeasant's garden one of the most complete Etruscan necropoli in Italy.\\nOne tomb is left exactly as it was found, with the contents -- vases,\\njars, utensils of bronze, &c. -- in their original position.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the troublous times that so often overtook Papal Rome no fewer than\\nthirty-two different Pontiffs found refuge in Orvieto from incipient\\nrevolutions. The impregnable situation of the city rendered it safe and\\nimmune from attack. Pope Clement VII., who fled here after the sack of\\nRome by the Emperor Charles V., caused the Pozzo di S. Patrizio to be\\nmade. This extremely cleverly constructed well is hewn out of the solid\\nrock for a depth of one hundred-and-eighty feet, and has a double spiral\\nstaircase outside the water shaft. The Papal Court naturally followed\\nthe Pope, and Orvieto in the days which have gone must have worn a more\\nhuman air than it does now. One can understand that then its dark,\\nsolemn streets resounded with a little gaiety, and its palaces had a\\ngreater show of life than they have at the present time. True, the\\nowners now spend most of the year in Rome, and reside in their fortress\\nhomes for the summer months only. But even their advent does not,\\nto the stranger, bring much more life into this solemn place. No\\nother word describes the palaces of Orvieto better than the above.\\nNearly every one of these fortress palaces has a tower of defence, the\\nwalls of which are from eight to ten feet thick. Many of them are\\nconnected with one another by underground passages, and none have any\\nwindows at all accessible from the outside. The lower class of\\ninhabitants are quiet and sad-looking. They appear even to this day to\\nlive under some heavy mental weight. Maybe generations of suppression\\nand the dominance of an intriguing Court has had an influence that is\\ninbred into the children born now. Then, too, it was so far down hill\\nand up across the opposite slopes to the world beyond! So toilsome a\\nclimb to return home! You feel this to-day when you live in\\nOrvieto -- feel that this silent city is an island. Can you be surprised,\\nwhen you think of these adverse influences, that the poorer Orvietans\\nhave not quite the gay and friendly air of the peasantry of the plains?\\nBut whatever the people may be, they live in a wonderful old city, and\\nthey live under the shadow of a grand Gothic cathedral.\\n\\nStanding in a fine open piazza with the Palazzo del Papa on one side,\\nthe Hospital on another, and the Bishop's palace on a third, this fine\\nchurch occupies the vantage ground of Orvieto. In the Vatican, one of\\nRaphael's well-known frescoes illustrates the miracle of Bolsena. It\\nwas to commemorate this that Pope Urban IV. founded the cathedral. The\\nmagnificent fa\\u00e7ade has three porches. The centre one has round arches,\\nand the other two are pointed. Four flat panels are at the bases of the\\nshafts that divide the fa\\u00e7ade. These shafts end in crocketed pinnacles\\nsurrounding the Gothic turrets, which soar upwards beyond the three\\ngables at the top of the fa\\u00e7ade. The gables themselves rise above the\\nroofs of the nave and aisles. The only fault one can find with this\\nbeautiful building, and it is one common to most Italian Gothic\\nchurches, is that the fa\\u00e7ade is \\\"stuck on,\\\" and does not really form\\npart of the architectural composition of the building. A glance at the\\nillustration will explain what is meant.\\n\\nThe four panels are justly placed among the masterpieces of Italian\\nsculpture of the thirteenth century. Vasari attributes the designs to\\nNiccol\\u00f2 Pisano. This may be, but it is known that Giovanni Pisano and\\nothers were the artists who executed them. The first in order begins at\\nthe lowest left-hand corner of the north panel, and records the Creation\\nof the World and all beasts and birds. Then follow the histories of Adam\\nand Eve, Cain and Abel, Jubal -- making bells, and Tubal-Cain measuring on\\na scroll with a compass.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis completes the first and best panel of the four. Each incident is\\nenclosed by a very beautifully cut and intricate pattern of the vine.\\nThe second panel depicts scenes from the Old Testament; the third, the\\nTree of Jesse, the Nativity and Life of Christ, with classic foliage\\nintervening. The fourth is very good and represents the Resurrection;\\nhere figures of a very Greek type rise from Greek sarcophagi. Saints,\\nVirgins, and the Saviour in Glory surrounded by Apostles also find\\nplaces on this panel. It finishes in the lowest right-hand corner with a\\nmost realistic scene in Hell. Raphael, it is said, came to Orvieto to\\nstudy these wonderful works.\\n\\nImmediately above and at the bases of the four shafts are the huge\\nbronze symbols of the four Evangelists. They rest on the abaci of the\\npilasters which form a sort of drip-course right along the fa\\u00e7ade. Over\\nthe centre porch is a bronze tent, the curtains of which Angels draw\\naside revealing the Virgin and Child seated. The lights, forming the\\ntympanums of the porches, are thin sheets of alabaster. The columns are\\nspiral and twisted, octagonal and quadrangular. Each is set against a\\ndifferent coloured background of black lava, red, white, or grey marble;\\nand each is covered with geometrical mosaic. The wheel window of the\\nfa\\u00e7ade is beautified with exceptionally good tracing. It is framed by\\nquatrefoils in panels, with the head of a saint in each. On two sides of\\nthese, in recessed rectangular niches, are statues of the Twelve\\nApostles.\\n\\nAt the top of the frame are canopied niches with a row of saints. The\\nwhole of this wonderful front is covered by modern mosaics which do not\\nquite fit in with the severe lines of the architecture. Neither does the\\nscheme of colour in which they are executed take its place with the\\nwarmth of the marble as well as it might.\\n\\nThe whole of the main building is constructed in bands of black lava and\\nwhite marble. Semicircular chapels in the aisles break the monotony of\\nthe lower portion of the exterior; while the upper is rendered less\\nsevere by the pointed clerestory windows, a dripstone and string-course,\\nand a good cornice.\\n\\nThe interior is one of the best in Italy. It was greatly improved when\\nthe colossal statues which stood at the bases of the piers were removed,\\nand the side chapels cleared of their altars and rather meretricious\\nadornments. The massive columns of the nave, eight of which are round,\\nfour clustered, and two engaged, have capitals that partake of a style\\nfar more classic than Gothic. Above the round arches they support runs a\\ntriforium gallery. This is open in the nave, and covered at the west\\nend, where it follows the slope upwards of the gables of the aisles. At\\nthe east end it is carried over the window, being also covered in here.\\nThe windows of the aisles are all filled, or partly filled, with thin\\nslabs of alabaster. The effect of light produced through this thick but\\ncomparatively translucent medium is extremely mellow and beautiful.\\n\\nThe short transepts are raised three steps above the nave, and the choir\\nfive. A fine red marble balustrade separates the latter from the rest of\\nthe church. The open stalls in the choir have some extremely good\\n intarsia work. The wooden screen that shuts them off from the nave is\\na carved mass of most intricate geometrical design. Under the east\\nwindow is the bishop's throne, backed and surrounded with more good\\n intarsia , in which saints and sainted bishops with their symbols most\\neffectively figure. The walls above and around are covered with\\nfourteenth-century frescoes by Pietro di Puccio and Ugolino, both native\\nartists. In their present faded state they harmonise beautifully with\\ntheir surroundings, to which the colour of the well-worn red marble\\nfloor of the cathedral adds a pleasant note.\\n\\nThe work of Luca Signorelli can be better studied in the Cappella della\\nMadonna di S. Brizio than anywhere else in Italy. This chapel\\npractically forms the shallow south transept. In the magnificent\\nfrescoes which adorn its walls one can trace the possible influence of\\nthis great painter on the works of Michael Angelo. Two panels of the\\nceiling came from the brush of Fra Angelico. The north transept is\\nalmost entirely occupied by the Cappella del S.S. Corporale. The\\nreliquary containing the \\\"Corporal,\\\" or linen cloth of the Miracle of\\nBolsena, is kept over the altar. This reliquary is a fine piece of\\nsilver-gilt work, with two dozen beautiful panels of blue enamel. It was\\non to this linen cloth that the Blood dropped from the broken Host, and\\nconvinced the officiating priest of the Real Presence. Pope Urban IV.\\nhad it brought from Bolsena, and commenced to build this magnificent\\ncathedral as a great shrine in which the sacred relic should rest for\\never.\\n\\nBehind the cathedral, that is to the east, Orvieto, not many years ago,\\nwas a ruined, broken-down mass of insanitary buildings. Gardens now take\\nthe place of what was a plague-spot, and the houses of the city as we\\nfind it now occupy barely one-half of the area contained within the\\nwalls. In this respect modern ideas have decidedly improved Orvieto.\\nWhat is left of the old streets is well looked after from the sanitary\\npoint of view; and from the artistic, there are not many places in Italy\\nwhere subjects are to be found in such plenty. The massive Torre del\\nMoro is close to the Piazza del Popolo, where stands the ruined church\\nof S. Domenico. This fine Romanesque structure is entered by a flight of\\nsteps at the west end; it is built over a massively constructed crypt,\\nnow used as a granary. The mighty arches of this crypt sustain part of\\nthe church, but it does not extend beneath the whole of the fabric. One\\nof the numerous arched gateways which are to be found throughout the\\ncity intervenes between it and the little buttressed dwelling underneath\\nthe east end. From this rises the solid campanile . An arcade runs\\nround the whole church. This good feature is composed of round arches,\\ncontaining small round-headed lights. The outer member of each arch is\\nfinished by a broad, flat, square billet, the inner has a cable pattern.\\nAbove is a dripstone and string-course.\\n\\nSaturday sees the piazza crowded with country folk, and it then presents\\na busy scene. All the rest of the week it is silent and deserted. I was\\nthere with my sketch-book one afternoon. A thunderstorm was rolling\\nabout in the hills. The air was charged with disturbing electricity.\\nSwifts flew screaming round the ruined church. A kestrel up in the\\nbattered old tower cried to her young. The storm crept nearer. Grand\\ncumuli clouds piled themselves higher and higher above the\\nlightning-riven mass of rain-sodden blackness below. A beautiful\\nswallow-tail butterfly, brilliant against the deep purple background,\\ncame gracefully sailing across the square into the sunshine. It hovered,\\nnow here, now there, like a spirit from another world seeking rest but\\nfinding none. Little puffs of wind stirred odd bits of straw and paper\\nabout the piazza. Dust began to eddy round and round. A drop of rain\\nfell on to the open leaves of my sketch-book. It was the writing on the\\nwall; so I closed the book and hurried home. For half an hour the\\nheavens emptied themselves on Orvieto. To me a stage-play of some scene\\nin her past was re-enacted in the sky; the passing storm seemed so\\nappropriate to the rugged old city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nROME\\n\\n\\nWith pen in hand one approaches the subject of the Eternal City with\\ngreat diffidence. The more one's acquaintance with her has ripened, the\\nmore does the attempt to write a chapter seem a hopeless task. There are\\nso many Romes -- Republican Rome, Imperial Rome, Rome of the Papal\\nsupremacy, Christian Rome, Pagan Rome; and then Modern Rome, with a\\nmunicipality that is fast changing the face of everything. Catering for\\nthe tourist in these days of cheap transit does much to alter things. In\\nthe end it will defeat its own object, and history will be contained in\\nlibraries and museums only. Rome, like London, is fast becoming\\ncosmopolitan. The per\\u00edcolo giallo , or \\\"yellow peril,\\\" as the motor\\npost 'bus is facetiously called, rushes through streets where not so\\nlong ago solemn processions of the Mother Church wended their way.\\nBuilding is going on at present with feverish haste. The \\\"boom\\\" of 1880,\\nwhich ruined many of the wealthy families who speculated in it, does not\\nseem to have acted as a deterrent to others. The great boulevard\\nprojected by the powers that be, slowly grows in length. Despite the\\noutcry against such vandalism, an area that might disclose and yield up\\nunknown arch\\u00e6ological treasures if properly excavated is being levelled\\nin the sacred names of sanitation and opportunism! The picturesque\\ndwellings that lined the banks of Rome's famous river have disappeared,\\nand the yellow waters of the historic Tiber rush along between massive\\nwalls of stone.\\n\\nIs it possible amid all these rapid changes to realise what Rome has\\nbeen and is still? No, not on any of her seven hills, not in her\\nstreets, nor on her river embankments, not even in her churches, can\\nthis now be done. No: to realise the power and majesty of Ancient Rome\\none must go out into the Campagna, that desolate plain in which she\\nlies. There, where the stupendous ruins of her great aqueducts stretch\\naway in utter loneliness to the distant hills; there, where once a\\nprosperous people dwelt in plenty, and where the only living things\\nlikely to be seen now are a statuesque goatherd and his nibbling\\nflock -- there, one may gather an idea of the might of ancient Rome. By\\nHadrian's Wall, which cuts the Borderland of England, one may do the\\nsame; and there are none of her ruined outposts, east or west, where her\\nmajesty is not more apparent than in the Eternal City herself.\\n\\n \\n\\nUp on the Palatine, close to the trees that are seen in the sketch of\\nthe Clovis Victori\\u00e6, the Etruscan wall of the first Rome is now in\\ncourse of excavation. Up there, too, are the remains of the first wall\\nof the Roman city built by Servius Tullius. In the Via Merulana part of\\na great earthwork with a moat outside can still be seen. Long after\\nCarthage had been practically obliterated by her rival, Rome had\\nextended so far, and attacks from outside became of so great a danger to\\nthe inhabitants, that Aurelian found it necessary to build a line of\\ndefence which the present walls might be said to occupy. From that time\\nonwards the city grew steadily to a magnificence and power which has\\nnever been equalled. She ruled the known world. But it was not until\\nConstantine the Great transferred himself and the seat of empire to\\nByzantium that the turning-point in her fortunes was reached. Well has\\nthe great emperor earned that proud title! From Milan he issued the\\ndecree which gave to the much persecuted Christians equal rights with\\nother religions; and even went further, embracing the faith he had\\nbefriended.\\n\\nMany churches lay claim to be the oldest foundation in Rome. S.\\nPudenziana is said to be the church S. Paul founded in the house of his\\nSenator friend Pudens. Recent excavations under S. Clemente have brought\\nto light early-Christian masonry beneath the Republican and Imperial\\nremains, over which the present edifice stands. S. Prisca is another\\nancient church; and tradition attributes S. Giovanni in Laterano, S.\\nPietro, S. Paolo, S. Lorenzo, S. Croce in Gerusalemene, S. Agnese, and\\nSS. Pietro e Marcellino to Constantine's era. The first four of these,\\nwith S. Maria Maggiore, were afterwards known as the Patriarchal\\nChurches over which the Pope presided. With S. Croce and S. Sebastiano,\\nthey became the seven churches of Rome. In them the Pontiff celebrated\\nHigh Mass; and they were the principal churches which drew pilgrims from\\nthroughout Christendom. In these seven the high altar presents its back\\nto the congregation, for His Holiness celebrates Mass with his face to\\nthe worshippers. The Papal supremacy really owed its foundation to\\nGregory the Great. But it was not until two hundred years after his\\ndecease, when on Christmas Day of the year 800, Charlemagne was crowned\\nby Leo III., that the \\\"Holy Roman Empire\\\" became an accomplished fact.\\nUnfortunately for Ancient Rome the Carlovingian period was one of\\ndemolition and plunder. Christian zeal cared nought for the beauty of\\npagan buildings, and many an one was pulled down and a church erected\\nwith the material. It was later on however, in the time of the\\nRenaissance, that columns and marble of every sort were used for the\\nadornment of the numerous sacred edifices which sprang up. What was not\\nwanted in construction was ground down to make lime. Banding iron,\\nclamps, bronzes, and every description of metal that was found were\\nthrown into furnaces and melted down. Nothing that could be made use of\\nfor building material was spared. The Church could never forget the\\npersecution she had undergone, nor the thousands of martyrs who had died\\nfor the Faith. Is it a matter for surprise then -- a surprise one must add\\nmingled with great regret -- that the glorious buildings of ancient Rome\\nhave almost disappeared?\\n\\nWhichever of all Rome's churches was founded first, there is no\\ndisputing the fact that the huge fabric which occupies one side of the\\nPiazza di S. Pietro is the most famous Christian edifice in the world.\\nBernini's best work, the grand colonnades on two sides of the square\\nlead up in splendid curves to the great fa\\u00e7ade of S. Peter's. But, so\\ngreat is the size of the building, so far set back the dome, that it is\\nimpossible to realise the immensity of either from any point of view in\\nthe piazza. The first church was founded in the year 90 at the place\\nwhere so many martyrs had suffered death during the time of the tyrant\\nNero. The Emperor Constantine commenced afterwards the erection of a\\nbasilica on this spot, the fa\\u00e7ade of which Raphael has handed down in\\nhis fresco of the Incendio del Borgo. When Julian della Rovere became\\nPope Julius II., he wantonly ordered the destruction of the church as it\\nthen stood. This was done to make way for a greater with which his own\\nname would be for ever connected; and he employed Bramante to design the\\nnew cathedral. Hands once more were laid on the buildings of ancient\\nRome and the construction was begun from its ruins. Except for some of\\nthe columns, the whole of the marble work of S. Peter's was, up to the\\ncommencement of last century, abstracted from the same source.\\nBramante's designs were never carried out. The many alterations to which\\nthey were subjected after his death led to great dissatisfaction, and in\\nthe end Michael Angelo was consulted. All he could do was to reserve as\\nmuch as possible of the great architect's ground plan, and this is,\\nexcept for the lengthening of the nave and the addition of the fa\\u00e7ade,\\nas the great cathedral stands to-day.\\n\\nThe immense travertine columns of the fa\\u00e7ade form part of a portico\\nwhich is over two hundred feet in length. Above the columns runs an\\ninscription recording that it was put up by the Borghese Pontiff, Paul\\nV. A balustrade, broken by pedestals, surmounts the cymatium ; on the\\npedestals are extra-colossal figures of the Saviour (in the centre) and\\nthe Twelve Apostles. At either end are groups of barroque angels\\nsurrounding a circle over which is the Papal Mitre. In one of these\\ncircles there is a timepiece. The ceiling of the portico is a fine\\nexample of stucco work.\\n\\nThere are five doors which open into the building. The central is of\\nbronze and one of the few things spared by the destroyer Julius when he\\ndemolished the old basilica. The doors next to this are those by which\\none enters the church. In March 1910 the old and very unhygienic leather\\nflaps were removed, and glazed swing-doors have taken their place. The\\nPorta Santa, or door at the north end of the portico, is walled up. It\\nwas only opened for the purpose of celebrating a Jubilee, and has been\\nclosed since 1825.\\n\\nMany and repeated visits are necessary to S. Peter's before the size of\\nthe vast interior can be in any way grasped. It is only when one is\\naccustomed to the scale of the little human figures walking about and\\ntheir insignificance in proportion to the whole, that the immense height\\nof even the Corinthian pilasters of the piers becomes apparent. The roof\\nis vaulted, coffered and gilded. It is supported by four piers on each\\nside of the nave. The floor is of coloured marble, and has the\\nmeasurements of the great churches of Christendom let in with brass at\\nthe spot where each would end if measured from the east. Just inside the\\ncentral bronze door is a slab of porphyry upon which the emperors were\\ncrowned. At the base of each pier, as well as in other parts of the\\nchurch, the colossal statues of the founders of different religious\\nOrders find a place. The last pier on the right has a bronze figure of\\nS. Peter seated, one foot of which is partially worn away by the lips of\\ndevotees.\\n\\nThe dome grows upwards from four massive buttresses. Niches above their\\nbases contain figures of SS. Longinus, Andrew, Helena, and Veronica, who\\nholds the napkin with the impress of the Saviour's Face. Under the dome\\nis the Confessio of S. Peter, to reach which a double flight of steps\\nleads down. Eighty-nine lamps for ever burn on the balustrade which\\nencloses the well of the entrance; and doors of gilded bronze shut off\\nthe niche in which the sarcophagus of the Apostle rests. Soaring high up\\non four bronze columns ninety-four feet from the floor, the great\\n baldacchino rises above all. But so immense is the space under the\\ndome that one has no idea of the height it attains. It was designed by\\nBernini, and is made partly of the bronze which covered the roof of the\\nPantheon.\\n\\nNothing at all can be said in praise of Bernini's design. The high\\naltar, at which only the Pope celebrates mass, is above the Confessio \\nand directly under the cross which forms the apex of this somewhat\\nunsightly mass of metal. The interior decoration of the dome is not in\\nany way striking. Above the four statues of the already enumerated\\nsaints are the loggie , containing the sacred relics of the lance which\\npierced the crucified Saviour's side, the head of S. Andrew, a portion\\nof the Cross, and the \\\"Volto-Santo\\\" -- the napkin or handkerchief of S.\\nVeronica, which wiped the Lord's brow on the way to Calvary. Four\\nmosaics of the Evangelists are beneath the frieze which carries the drum\\nof the dome; and a series of four each are between the sixteen gilded\\nribs of the vaulting. In the tribune at the east end of the cathedral is\\nthe ancient wooden episcopal chair of S. Peter.\\n\\nAmongst other celebrated things which S. Peter's contains is the Piet\\u00e0\\nof Michael Angelo in the Capella della Piet\\u00e0. The great sculptor has\\ninscribed his name on the girdle of the Virgin -- the only occasion on\\nwhich he has done so. Opening out from this chapel is another, in which\\nis a column, said to be that against which Christ leaned when preaching\\nin the Temple at Jerusalem. Adjacent to this is the tomb of the great\\nCountess Matilda by Bernini. The tombs and monuments of many Popes are\\nto be found in other chapels, but none of them possess any real artistic\\nmerit. The best is that of Alessandro Farnese, Pope Paul III. It is by\\nGuglielmo della Porta, and was one of the most expensive to erect. In\\nthe crypt, which is divided into two parts, the Grotte Vecchie, and the\\nGrotto Nuovo, are the sarcophagi and fragments of sarcophagi of many\\nother Popes, among them being that of Nicholas Breakspeare, the only\\nEnglishman who ever attained the dignity. The sarcophagus of S. Peter,\\nalready mentioned, is in the Confessio , or shrine of SS. Peter and\\nPaul, which is richly ornamented with gold and studded with jewels.\\n\\nIn the Stanza Capitolare, which is part of the sacristy, are some\\nremnants from the brush of Giotto that at one time adorned the walls of\\nthe old Confessio . The treasury contains a wonderful collection of\\njewelled crucifixes and candelabra. Among the latter is to be found the\\nwork of Cellini and Michael Angelo. The famous sacerdotal robe known as\\nthe Dalmatica di Papa San Leone, and said to be that used at the\\ncoronation of Charlemagne, is also kept here. Apart from its sacred\\ninterest, the great cathedral of S. Peter's cannot be said to raise any\\nfeelings other than wonderment at its size and admiration for its grand\\nproportions. The exterior is disappointing, and many and many a visit\\nmust be paid to the interior before wonderment reaches admiration. Just\\nas it is possible to gain the best impression of the power of ancient\\nRome outside Rome itself, so does one grasp the size of the mighty\\nfabric only when some miles away in the country beyond the walls. Climb\\nthe lower slopes of the hills near Tivoli or Frascati, and what does one\\nsee? Apparently a level plain, out of which rises far away a marvellous\\ndome. From Tivoli, especially, one sees nothing of the city on the Seven\\nHills. The line of fir-trees beyond Monte Mario is visible, and maybe,\\nthe afternoon sun shining on the distant Mediterranean. But save for the\\ngreat dome there is nothing to indicate to the eye that the Eternal City\\nlies well within the range of vision. Yet in Rome itself, though it is\\nparadoxical to say so, the dome of S. Peter's in no way dominates\\nanything, albeit that it rises above everything else. The enormous\\nmonument in course of erection on the Capitoline appears bigger. Each of\\nthe seven hills seems to be of greater altitude. But the former is not\\nso large, and the latter do not reach the same height. Thus, the great\\nchurch holds her own -- but, physically as well as spiritually, one must\\ngo outside Rome to realise this.\\n\\nTo return to ancient times, we find an absorbingly interesting link with\\npre-Christian days sculptured on one of the panels which decorate the\\ninterior of the Arch of Titus. The Via Sacra passed under this arch,\\nwhich was erected to commemorate the taking of Jerusalem. The panel in\\nquestion has figured on it in bas-relief a procession bearing the\\nseven-branched candlestick and tabernacle which were spoils from the\\nJewish Temple. This is the only known material proof existing of the\\nformer object, and may therefore be justly said to be of surpassing\\necclesiastical interest. Through the archway one sees the half-ruined\\nwalls of the Colosseum, the greatest amphitheatre in the world. This,\\ntoo, is of intense religious interest. In the arena hundreds of\\nChristian martyrs were torn to pieces by wild beasts, or butchered to\\nfill the passing hours with amusement for the Roman populace. Pope\\nBenedict XIV. consecrated the interior after erecting gates outside to\\npreserve it from the demolition which up to his day had been going on\\nfor centuries. Small chapels were also formed amongst the lower\\nstructural arches, and services held where once the walls resounded to\\nthe shouts of bloodthirsty spectators. Close by the Colosseum is another\\nfine archway, the Arch of Constantine. This likewise, has an interest\\napart from its design. It was put up when the great emperor declared\\nhimself in favour of the Christian faith. The devout may ponder over the\\nfact that these two arches, so closely connected with Christianity, are\\nstill standing, while nearly every other has long since been razed to\\nthe ground.\\n\\n \\n\\nAway to the south-east of these three buildings the Mother Church of\\nRome is situated close to the city walls. Here, on rising ground,\\noverlooking the vast Campagna, stands S. Giovanni in Laterano, \\\"omnium\\nurbis et orbis ecclesiarum mater et caput.\\\" Dedicated originally to\\nChrist the Saviour, and afterwards in the sixth century to S. John, this\\nfine basilica is of much greater, arch\\u00e6ological interest than S.\\nPeter's. The present building dates from the seventeenth century. All\\nthat remains of the once attached Benedictine monastery is to be found\\nin the very beautiful cloisters, which are a transition between\\nRomanesque and Gothic. The church itself has a fine eastern fa\\u00e7ade -- it\\norientates to the west -- of five arches with an intervening gallery. In\\nthe atrium is a statue of Constantine found in his Therm\\u00e6 . The\\ninterior of the basilica is simple, with a very good opus Alexandrinum \\nfloor. The aisles are double, and are separated from the nave by eleven\\nbays on each side. Colossal statues of Apostles and Prophets find places\\nat the bases of the pillars. The transepts and tribune are raised above\\nthe body of the church. In the centre, the high altar is situated under\\nan ornate Gothic canopy. This contains a tabernacle, erected partly at\\nthe expense of Charles V. of France, to receive the busts of SS. Peter\\nand Paul which were found amidst the ruins of the older church. A few\\nyears ago the tribune was extended and beautifully inlaid with mosaic\\ncarrying out a design of the thirteenth century. Michael Angelo is said\\nto have designed the flat ceiling of the nave, and there is a wooden\\nfigure of S. John by Donatello in the sacristy.\\n\\nIn the Piazza di S. Giovanni in Laterano stands a building that contains\\nthe Scala Santa, a flight of steps from Pilate's palace in Jerusalem,\\nwhich Christ is said to have ascended. They are covered with wood, and\\nmay only be ascended on the knees. Light enters through barred windows,\\nand partly illumines the solemn gloom of this deeply interesting place.\\nAt the top of the stairs is the Sancta Sanctorum, on the architrave\\nabove which is engraved in Latin: \\\"There is not a place in the whole\\nworld more holy.\\\" This was the old chapel of the Popes and the only part\\nof the Pontifical palace that the fire of 1308 did not consume. The\\npresent Palazzo del Laterano was built on part of the site of that which\\nthis fire destroyed. The old palace was the residence of the Popes from\\nthe time of Constantine until their migration to Avignon. The building\\nthat now enjoys the above title is a museum, wherein are many fine\\npieces of pagan sculpture as well as other interesting antiquities. The\\nbaptistery of the Lateran stands to the west of the basilica. The\\ninterior of this octagonal building is simple but not well lighted.\\nEight porphyry columns support an antique architrave; and eight smaller\\ncolumns of marble rise from this and support the dome. The font is in\\nthe centre of the floor, which is lower than the pavement near the\\nwalls. It is of green basalt, and is supposed to be that in which the\\nAnglo-Saxon king Caedwalla was baptised in the year 689. Rienzi bathed\\nin it the night before he summoned the Pope and the Electors of Germany\\nto appear before him for judgment.\\n\\nAnother and more magnificent basilica is that of S. Paolo fuori, which\\nis situated two miles out of Rome on the Via Ostia. It is the grandest\\nof the many basilicas Rome possesses. Constantine erected a trop\\u00e6um ,\\nor sepulchral monument over the spot where Lucina buried the apostle's\\nbody; and in 386 the Consul Sallustrius by the Emperor's order began to\\nbuild the church, which was known as the Basilica Ostiensis. The little\\ntown that arose around this sacred spot was on the banks of the Tiber,\\nand from its position was subject to raids from the Saracens and other\\nmarauders who sailed up the stream. John VIII. in the ninth century\\nenclosed the basilica and most of the surrounding buildings within a\\nfortified wall. For fifteen hundred years this grand church has had as\\nvenerated a shrine as S. Peter's. The kings of England were its\\nprotectors until the Reformation severed their connection with the Roman\\ncreed; and sovereigns from all parts of Christendom came here to\\nworship. On July 17, 1823, the pine roof caught fire and fell into the\\nnave. The heat from the smouldering mass was so great that some of the\\ncolumns split and the whole fabric was almost entirely destroyed. Pius\\nIX. presided at a great function in 1854, when prelates from all over\\nthe world assisted at the consecration of the restored building. Eighty\\nmonoliths of Simplon granite, brought down Lake Maggiore to the river Po\\nand then by sea up the Tiber, sustain the roof of the nave and aisles. A\\nseries of Papal portraits form a frieze above them. Magnificent columns\\nof Egyptian alabaster presented by Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt,\\nsupport the baldacchino over the high altar. The bases of these\\ncolumns are malachite, and were given by the Czar Nicholas of Russia.\\nMany other portions of this noble church were given by other princes.\\nThe dismay and regret at its destruction were universal. The body of S.\\nPaul rests in the Confessio beneath the altar. The very beautiful\\ncloisters of the old Benedictine monastery, now a barrack, vie with\\nthose at Monreale in Sicily, which are illustrated in another chapter.\\nThe noble atrium at the west end of the basilica is almost complete,\\nand when it is finished and opened out to the river, S. Paolo fuori will\\nonce more take rank as one of the grandest ecclesiastical edifices in\\nItaly. Among the other basilicas of Rome, S. Maria Maggiore, or the\\nBasilica Liberiana, is the largest, and commands a fine position on the\\nEsquiline. S. Sabina on the Aventine, that hill which is still almost\\nentirely covered by gardens, is connected with the Dominican monastery\\nthat adjoins it. The church possesses a wonderfully carved wooden door\\nand an orange tree in its court which grew from an orange pip that S.\\nDominic planted. S. Agnese fuori is close to one of the entrances to the\\nnumerous catacombs. Into this church every twenty-first day of January\\ntwo lambs are brought to be blessed. After the ceremony is over they are\\npresented to his holiness at the Vatican, and then sent to the convent\\nof S. Cecilia-Trastevere. Here the good nuns weave their wool into\\n palliums , which are subsequently worn by different metropolitans of\\nthe church.\\n\\nThe only Gothic church in Rome is that of S. Maria sopra Minerva. It\\ncontains the tomb-slab of Fra Angelico, whose face, rendered in marble,\\nhas a very sad and rather austere look. The interior of the church is\\nmarble, and it cannot be said that this polished shining surface is\\ndesirable for the lines of a Gothic building. Not far from S. Maria is\\nthe most perfect pagan edifice in all Rome -- the Pantheon. Here again we\\nhave a heathen fabric that afterwards became a Christian church.\\nBoniface IV. consecrated the temple, that Marcus Agrippa had built more\\nthan six hundred years previously, to S. Maria ad Martyres. Sixteen huge\\ncolumns of oriental granite form the portico, and the ancient bronze\\ndoors still remain. The interior is a magnificent rotunda lighted by a\\ncircular aperture in the centre of the coffered dome. Against the walls,\\nin recesses, rest the sarcophagi of Raphael and other painters. Here\\ntoo, sleeping his last long sleep, lies King Victor Emmanuel II., to\\nwhom all Italians owe so much.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe church best known to foreigners is undoubtedly that which figures in\\nthe illustration, S. Trinit\\u00e0 de' Monti. There is nothing about the\\nchurch itself to call for comment; but its fine position, above the\\nbeautifully arranged steps, in the middle of what may be called the\\n\\\"foreign quarter,\\\" makes it worthy of note. Close by is the Villa\\nMedici, the French Academy of Rome. At the base of the steps is the\\nflower market. Until recently Italians had a great objection to cut\\nflowers in their rooms -- they were supposed to be unhealthy. Through\\nforeign influence this is slowly giving way, and the market is as\\nmuch patronised by the Romans as by the residents of other\\nnationalities. Not many years ago the foot of these steps used to be\\nthronged every morning by artists' models, who, in the picturesque garb\\nof their native districts, sat here waiting for a day's hire. The few\\nwho still do this have moved off to the steps of the Greek church in the\\nVia del Babuino, and the flavour of the Campagna and the mountains they\\ngave to the Piazza di Spagna is now a thing of the past. Everything\\nchanges, everything passes away. The gaily coloured costumes of the\\n ciociare , the peasants from the districts between Rome and\\nNaples -- so-called from the cioce or sandal they wear -- is now never\\nseen. The exaggerated dress of the flower sellers, who pester the\\nforeigner to buy little faded nosegays, is simply worn for the purpose\\nof extracting soldi and as a subterfuge for begging. Away up in the\\nmountains beyond Tivoli are two villages, Saracenesco and Articoli.\\nThough they are adjacent the dialect of the inhabitants is different.\\nThere is a deadly feud between them. They both provide the artist in\\nRome with models. Those who come from the last named pose for the\\nfigure, but those from Sarecenesco will only sit draped. They still\\nprovide the wet-nurses for Roman babies; for the physique of these\\nSabine villagers is very fine, as fine perhaps as in the days when the\\nSabine women were carried off by Roman youths.\\n\\nBeyond the Villa Medici lie the beautiful gardens of the Pincio. From\\nthe terrace at the end, on the brow of the hill, one gets the famous\\nview of Rome. The shady walks and well-kept drives of these noted\\ngardens, and those of the adjoining Villa Borghese, are the favourite\\nrendezvous in the evening for Roman society. We must leave this\\nbeautiful pleasaunce and dive down into the labyrinth of streets\\nbelow. Nothing probably strikes one so much on a first visit to the\\nEternal City as the number of fountains and obelisks that are to be\\nfound in whichever direction a morning's walk takes one. Rome is the\\nbest supplied of any capital in the world with water, and though she has\\nnot the thirteen thousand odd fountains recorded by Cardinal Mai in the\\nyear 1540, those that remain still flow unceasingly. The Aqua Virgo\\nbrought into Rome by Agrippa to supply his therm\\u00e6 at the back of the\\nPantheon rushes a never-failing supply into the huge Fontana di Trevi.\\nOne may sometimes see a Roman of the poorer class drinking furtively\\nfrom the basin into which the water runs, drinking because he is leaving\\nhis native city and wishes to assure a safe return. The Fontana del\\nTritone is formed by dolphins, whose tails meet to support the\\ncoat-of-arms of the Barberini -- the fine Palazzo Barberini is close\\nby -- and is surmounted by a Triton holding a conch shell to his mouth. In\\nquite another district, down by the river hidden away amidst the narrow\\nstreets of the Ghetto, is the little Piazza Tartaruga. In the middle of\\nthis charming little square stands the Fontana delle Tartaruga. The\\ndesign of this beautiful \\\"Fountain of the Tortoises\\\" has been attributed\\nto Raphael. It is certainly worthy of his great name. The bronze figures\\nof the four youths supporting the basin of the fountain are\\nexceptionally good. With one hand each grasps the tail of a dolphin, the\\nother is raised above their heads to assist the struggles of the little\\nbronze tortoises that are endeavouring to crawl over the slippery wet\\nlip of the bowl. The Fontana La Barcassia, in the Piazza di Spagna, a\\ncorner of which is seen in the sketch of S. Trinit\\u00e0 de' Monti, is no\\ndoubt better known than the last named, but there is no public fountain\\nin Rome that approaches in any way the artistic merit of \\\"The\\nTortoises.\\\"\\n\\nIt is but a step from this to the gloomy looking Palazzo Cenci, which\\nrecalls the tragedy of Beatrice of that name. Another pace further on\\nand we find ourselves in a recently cleared space with the new Jewish\\nSynagogue standing close to the river Embankment. Here was situated the\\nold Ghetto of Rome, a quarter which is being fast demolished. One\\ncertainly cannot regret the disappearance of some of the abominable\\nslums that not so long ago stood where the housebreaker's pick and\\nshovel have been at work. It was but a few yards from the synagogue that\\nthe sketch of the Isle of S. Bartholomew and the old Roman Pons\\nFabricius was made. S. Bartolommeo is the only island on the Tiber in\\nits course through Rome; and the picturesque buildings of the old\\nmonastery are the only buildings left, which the yellow river washes, of\\nall those that less than thirty years ago lined its banks. There is a\\ndifferent air about the Trastevere district across the water. It is\\nanother city altogether than the one left behind on the other bank. The\\nforeigner is not so much in evidence, we are once again in Italy. Mount\\nthe steep ascent of the Janiculum, and from the wide space in front of\\nthe colossal equestrian statue of Garibaldi you will get a grand view of\\nRome, with the Campagna and Alban mountains beyond. From the top of the\\nhill, as one turns northwards, we seem on a level with S. Peter's great\\ndome. One is puzzled once again, when remembering how it really towers\\nabove all, to find that it is not of much significance in the view.\\nNothing of course is seen of the Vatican, which is situated on the other\\nside of S. Peter's. In the illustration of the Cathedral, however, there\\nis just visible the corner which adjoins it.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Vatican is the largest Palace in the world and contains the vastest\\nand most heterogeneous collection of all. It is quite impossible to\\nenumerate a tenth of the treasures hidden behind its ochre-coloured\\nwalls. Neither can one enter here into any description of the Sistine\\nchapel with Michael Angelo's masterpiece, or Raphael's magnificent\\nfrescoes in the Stanze and Loggie. We must pass over the famous picture\\ngallery and the antiquities in the Museo Pio-Clementino and the Museo\\nChiaramonti, simply remarking that the Vatican Museums hold the finest\\ncollections in the world. There is one antique in the square outside\\nwhich deserves a passing notice, and that is the great monolith of\\ngranite standing in the centre of the Piazza di S. Pietro. If Rome is a\\ncity of fountains, it is also a city of obelisks. This enormous block of\\nstone was brought by Caligula from Heliopolis and placed in the circus\\nof Nero, which occupied so much of the ground on which the great\\nbasilica was afterwards erected. Eight hundred men, besides many horses\\nand over forty cranes, were requisitioned to elevate it in its present\\nposition. Turning away from the Vatican and diving into the squalid\\nquarters of the Borgo, one comes on to the covered passage which John\\nXXIII. commenced to build in order to afford a safe mode of retreat\\nfrom the palace to the Castle of S. Angelo. The fortress of S. Angelo\\nwas erected by the Emperor Hadrian as his family tomb; and, as such, its\\nexterior was perhaps decorated with statues. The Emperor died in his\\nvilla at Bai\\u00e6 on the Bay of Naples, but his body was brought here, to be\\njoined, as time went on, by the mortal remains of Marcus Aurelius,\\nCaracalla, and others.\\n\\nThe history of the castle is the history of Rome in the Middle Ages. It\\nhas many times withstood a siege, and among other vicissitudes fell\\nbefore the prowess of Totila and his Goths. The sarcophagus of its\\nfounder was used as the tomb for Innocent II., and its inverted lid now\\nforms the font in the baptistery of S. Peter's. The streets in the\\nneighbourhood of the castle have undergone an absolute change. Wide\\nthoroughfares and huge blocks of flats cover the ground that a few years\\nago was a huge slum. The new Courts of Justice face the river, and the\\nembankment in front is now a fine boulevard. We cross the water once\\nmore, by the Ponte Margherita, the bridge which is highest up the Tiber,\\nand find ourselves in that fine square the Piazza del Popolo. Above the\\nbeautiful terraces that form the precipitous slope of the Pincio, the\\ntrees that adorn the gardens stand out against the blue of the sky. At\\nthe foot of the terraces is the church of S. Maria del Popolo, erected\\non the site of the Domitii tombs, the ghost-haunted burial place of the\\ncruel Nero. Adjoining the church is a grand gateway, the Porta del\\nPopolo. Under its arches on the straight road that runs north, the Via\\nFlaminia, marched out of Rome all those legions that went forth to\\nconquer and to extend the bounds of an Empire that has seen no rival.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNAPLES\\n\\n\\nThe old Greek colony of Parthenope was founded by settlers from Cum\\u00e6,\\nand when the islanders of Pithecus\\u00e6 (Ischia) built their adjoining town\\nof Neapolis, it became known as Pal\\u00e6opolis. Its port was where the\\nharbour of S. Lucia existed up to twenty years ago. Neapolis occupied\\nthat part of the present Naples which lies to the east of this. About\\n400 B.C. the Republic, formed by these two then united towns, allied\\nitself with Rome; and during the height of the Empire's power, her\\nrulers, statesmen, and poets built themselves residences on the shores\\nof the beautiful bay. Augustus did much for Neapolis, and Tiberius\\nsought refuge in that entrancing island, Capri, where to this day his\\ninfamies are a byword. Claudius, Nero, Titus, and Hadrian, whose palace\\ncan be seen under the waters of the blue Mediterranean near Pozzuoli,\\nhave all left traces of some sort or other in and about Naples. Lombards\\nand Normans, Swabians and Spaniards were each in turn drawn hither,\\nallured by the beauty of the situation. Colossal figures in marble of\\nthe most famous rulers of Naples occupy niches on the fa\\u00e7ade of the\\nRoyal Palace, and here Roger the Norman, Frederick II., the Swabian, who\\nfounded the university, Charles of Anjou, Alfonso of Arragon, Charles\\nIII., Joachim Murat, and Victor Emmanuel II. gaze stonily from their\\nretreats at the noisy tram and rushing motor-car.\\n\\nThe Spanish Bourbons were the last to rule in Naples before Italy was\\nunited towards the close of the last century. They did much to improve\\nthe city but nothing to help its people. Twenty years ago there were\\nstill left members of the aristocracy who every year journeyed to Paris\\nto pay their court to Francis II., the last of that race of kings whose\\nreign had ended at the disastrous battle of Gaeta.\\n\\nNaples, like Rome, changes every year. Modern improvements bring\\nsanitation, but do away with all that is picturesque. All over the world\\nhotels are becoming a great factor in the life of the folk who have\\nspare cash, and Naples, with her splendid water supply and unrivalled\\nposition, is not behind in her eagerness to catch the foreigner's gold.\\nTourists by the thousand reach her by sea, and the enterprising agents\\nwho arrange the itinerary pop them into cabs, drive them through the\\nstreets, and deposit them at the far-famed Museum, where they are\\nhustled from one gallery to another by the anything but intelligent\\nguide. However, the Museum alone is worth a visit to Naples. The ashes\\nfrom Mte Somma which smothered Pompeii, preserved for subsequent ages\\nobjects in bronze, in earthenware, and in glass, which lie in their\\ncases -- an open book of the domestic life of the Roman for every one to\\nread. The great Farnese Hercules, brought by Caracalla from Athens to\\nadorn his baths in Rome, is in one of the lower galleries. It is without\\nexception the finest illustration of mighty strength in repose that\\nexists. In the days when Glycon the Athenian evolved and produced this\\nmasterpiece, art was of more account in the lives of the people than it\\nis now, and so much was his Hercules appreciated and admired that it was\\nimpressed on the money of Athens and the coins of Caracalla. Among the\\nmany small statuettes that the excavator's shovel has been the means of\\nbringing to light is a very beautiful little winged figure of Victory.\\nNothing can exceed the grace of the composition and the floating-in-air\\nquality this small treasure possesses. One of the best specimens of\\nGreek bronze work is the so-called Narcissus. A row of bronze statues\\nfrom the theatre at Pompeii place vividly before one the actors of the\\nGreek stage, just as the armour and magnificent helmets of the\\ngladiators bring the arena and its gory triumphs in front of one's\\neyes.\\n\\nBut, like the tourist, we must hurry on to the cathedral. The fa\\u00e7ade,\\napproached by steps from the narrow street, is not in any way\\nnoticeable. The interior retains some of the original Gothic, but, owing\\nto earthquakes, has been altered and restored, and now presents itself\\nas a great incongruity to the eye. The illustration will make this\\napparent. Gothic arches form the bays of the nave. The aisles are also\\nGothic, and so is the arch over the tribune at the east end. Corinthian\\nshafts and dark marble pilasters run up the square piers of the nave. At\\nthe base of the shafts, under classic canopies, are the busts of\\nnumerous archbishops, and between the piers are the confessionals. These\\nlatter give a rich note of brown, which, with the gilded candelabra on\\neither side of the busts, finds an echo in the heavy and richly coloured\\nceiling. The vista of the north aisle is the best architectural feature\\nin the building. The south aisle is marred by the obtruding classic\\ncolumns of its side chapels. At the high altar, which the illustration\\nshows, the blood of S. Januarius liquefies every year on the anniversary\\nof the saint's martyrdom in September. The whole cathedral is then\\ncrowded, and the intense fervour and excitement of the immense\\ncongregation when the blood, in a phial held aloft by the\\nofficiating priest, begins to liquefy, is a sight that once seen can\\nnever be forgotten.\\n\\n \\n\\nImmediately under the high altar in the crypt is the Confessio of S.\\nGennario. Its marble roof is supported by ten Ionic columns. The richly\\nsculptured decoration of the chapel is very fine. The figure of Cardinal\\nCaraffa, who built it, kneels beside the altar under which repose the\\nsaint's remains. One other thing of architectural note is the\\nArchbishop's throne in the nave. This good specimen of Gothic work is\\nupheld by most elaborately sculptured pillars, and arches with extremely\\nbeautiful tracery.\\n\\nThe most interesting part of Naples lies round the cathedral. Narrow\\nstreets, darkened by the clothes that hang from balcony and pole, form a\\nmaze which it is easy to wander into, but very difficult to escape from.\\nSome of the finest of the old palaces stand in these dirty\\nthoroughfares. One may pass them a dozen times and still be quite\\nunaware of their existence. The moving crowd that throngs these narrow\\nstreets does not show any particular regard for the sightseer, and the\\ncareless Jehu who drives whither he will is absolutely unmindful of the\\npedestrian. So if you would explore old Naples you must look after\\nyourself, and -- as a caution too -- look after your pockets. It is unwise\\nto display a watch chain, or to carry anything that may be easily\\nsnatched from the hand. Remember you are in the midst of expert thieves\\nand among the most heterogeneous race on the face of the globe, a race\\nwithout the slightest idea of morals of any sort whatever. In the\\ntortuous Via S. Biagio stands a thirteenth-century palace built by one\\nof the Caraffa family, and since known as the Palazzo Santangelo. Some\\nof the best objects in the Museum first found a home in this fine old\\nhouse. Pope, Paul IV. and the great Neapolitan cardinal, Caraffa, were\\nborn in the Palazzo Caraffa in the same street. The central post-office\\nis now housed in the Palazzo Gravina, built in the fifteenth century by\\none of the Orsini; and the great dwelling of the Monticelli is one of\\nthe best specimens of the domestic architecture of the same century.\\n\\nNot far from the post-office is the church of S. Chiara. Despite the\\nhideous scheme of decoration which has transformed an otherwise fine\\nconcert hall -- for S. Chiara is more like one than a church -- into a\\ncuriosity of bad taste, there is a great deal of interest within the\\nfabric. Founded at the commencement of the fourteenth century by Robert\\nthe Wise, the church contains his monument and also others of the royal\\nhouse of Anjou. The frescoes with which Giotto adorned the walls have\\nlong ago disappeared, and if it were not for the royal tombs S. Chiara\\nwould not be worth a visit. Behind the high altar, at the back of which\\nstairs lead up to a platform enabling one to examine it, is the\\nmagnificent tomb of King Robert. The royal sarcophagus rests on Gothic\\npillars and is adorned by sculptures of the king and his children. His\\nrecumbent figure lies extended in the garb of a Franciscan, which Order\\nhe entered a few days before his death. Above this, under a canopy, is\\nhis figure seated on a throne and clad in royal robes. The beautiful\\nGothic canopy is supported by slender clustered columns, with five rows\\nof saints in niches carried up to the base of the crocketed pinnacles\\nthat surround the canopy. Robert's son Charles, Duke of Calabria, and\\nMary of Valois, his second wife, lie in sarcophagi that are upheld by\\nfigures of angels. These two splendid tombs are to the south of the\\ngreat king's. To the north are those of Mary, Empress of Constantinople,\\nand of her third husband, Philip of Taranto. Two of her children, Agnese\\nand Clementia, lie also near by; the former, who was married twice,\\nespoused firstly one of the Scaligeri, or della Scala, of Verona. To the\\nright of the high altar is a chapel adorned with fleur-de-lys, the\\nburial place of the royal house of Bourbon. This little chapel and the\\ntombs in it lose greatly in historical sentiment by their hideous and\\ngarish surroundings.\\n\\nS. Domenico Maggiore, the curious exterior of which is illustrated, was\\noriginally a noble Gothic edifice. The restorer, unfortunately, has\\naltered and added to this, and although the interior plan is much the\\nsame as when first erected, the terrible colours with which it is\\ncovered detract in no small measure from its very fine proportions. The\\nsketch shows the exterior of the five-sided apse. The dull yellow tufa\\nwith which it is faced and the embattled cornice and buttresses give it\\na decidedly eastern appearance. S. Domenico may be entered by the door\\njust visible on the left, to reach which one toils up a long flight of\\nmoss-grown steps. Push aside the heavy leather flap, and the noisy\\nlittle piazza, with all Naples beyond, are immediately things of the\\nremote past. You are in a beautiful little twelfth-century chapel. Its\\nwalls are lined with most interesting tomb slabs. Note the short figures\\non each. The Neapolitan is very low of stature, and these short figures,\\nalthough the tombs are of the twelfth and two succeeding centuries,\\npoint to the surmise that the men of the south were never tall. From\\nthis chapel one enters the great church at the south transept.\\nImmediately on our left is the sacristy. Here in the gallery which\\noccupies one wall are forty-five burial chests, among which ten\\nhold the remains of ten princes and princesses of the royal line of\\nAragon. Those which have been identified are Ferdinand I. and II., one\\nof the Dukes of Montalto and his Duchess, and Cardinal Louis d'Aragona.\\nAnother contains the husband of the celebrated Vittoria Colonna, the\\nMarquis of Pescara who defeated Francis I. at Pavia. There is something\\nof interest to be found in every chapel in the church. In one of them is\\nthe crucifix which conversed with S. Thomas Aquinas while he was\\ncomposing his Summa Theologi\\u00e6 . The saint's cell may still be seen, and\\nalso the room in which he gave his addresses when lecturer in the\\nuniversity that was within the walls of the adjoining monastery. The\\nhigh altar, raised well above the steps of the choir, is one of the most\\nremarkable specimens of Florentine inlay in the country. It has the\\ncurious adjuncts of a recessed seat on either side, and two very fine\\nmarble candelabra.\\n\\n \\n\\nThese are but three of the three hundred churches Naples possesses.\\nClimb the hill of the Mte Calvari crowned by the Castel Sant' Elmo and\\nlook out from the Belvedere in the suppressed Carthusian monastery of S.\\nMartino. Try to count the towers, domes, and spires standing out from\\nthe carpet of roofs below. You will be fatigued before you have reached\\nthe second hundred. Perhaps the magnificent prospect over the blue bay,\\nwith Isola da Capri and the Punta Campanella in the distance, the\\nSorrentine peninsula and the wonderful shape of Vesuvius on the left,\\nwill distract your arithmetic. At any rate the counting of the churches\\nis not worth the trouble when such a glorious view lies before one.\\nBeyond the garden -- the old monastic garden, how the monks must have\\nrevelled in it! -- and beyond the roofs below, the Castel dell' Ovo juts\\nout into the bay. To the left of it, shipping of all nationalities rides\\nthe water along the quays near the Arsenal and royal palace. The funnels\\nof huge liners stand up amidst a forest of masts beyond the\\nImmacolatella in a fine sweep to the Rione Margherita di Savoia.\\nCoasting boats with sails like butterflies skim the water. Down in the\\nharbour all is animation; but so far are we above it that not a sound\\nbreaks through the distant hum to enable us to distinguish any one\\nparticular note.\\n\\nThe cloisters of S. Martino are very beautiful. Sixteen white marble\\nDoric columns form the arcade on each of the four sides. The cells of\\nthe departed monks are shut now and the holes through which their food\\nwas passed, bricked up. The walls are white; the classic well-head in\\nthe centre of the garden is white and so are its steps. The little\\nburial ground in one corner of the court has a white marble balustrade\\non which are very realistic white marble skulls. Everything gleams white\\nin this quiet court, and the deep blue of the southern sky intensifies\\nit all. For a painter it is a rare study, but perhaps not so fine an one\\nas I once saw years ago. It was in January, snow had fallen for two or\\nthree days -- even Capri was covered -- when with a friend I walked up to\\nthe Carthusian monastery of Camaldoli. We reached it just as the fall\\nwhich had been going on all day ceased. A thick white carpet of fresh\\nuntrodden snow lay round us. The white monastery walls looked dull. We\\nrang at the gate, a white garbed monk opened it. We were in a white\\ncourtyard surrounded by white walls, and a line of white monks moved\\nslowly towards the chapel. Everything was white. But what a subtlety in\\nthe distinction of the colour! Only the sky was grey, and that such a\\nbeautiful pearly tone. I question if pigment even in a master's hand\\ncould have faithfully reproduced the scene.\\n\\nNaples was very different in those days. S. Lucia existed then. Now the\\nold harbour is filled up and modern hotels stand where frail wooden\\npiers ran out into the water. From these spider-like structures oysters\\nhung down in baskets fructifying in the outlet of the main sewer! S.\\nLucia was surpassingly picturesque and gay with the life of the lowest\\nclass, but -- surpassingly odoriferous. Stalls lined the pavements. Fish\\nof all sorts, cooling drinks, lemons, oranges, every description of\\nfruit, were displayed in the shade of multi-coloured awnings.\\n Lazzaroni lay stretched all day long on the sea wall, or slept on the\\nfoot-ways propped against the houses. Domestic toilettes performed out\\nof doors in the street never excited remark. And the houses themselves,\\nwhat a blaze of shifting colour when the wind stirred the sheets and\\nclothing hung out to dry from a hundred balconies! All is changed. The\\nsewage is carried out to sea right away at Cum\\u00e6. There are no more\\noysters at S. Lucia; there is no longer a S. Lucia, but with its\\ndisappearance Naples has lost its most unique attraction.\\n\\nAway at the end of the Chiaia, past the celebrated Marine Aquarium, the\\nhill of Posillipo rises above the little fishing harbour of Mergellina.\\nA tram will carry you swiftly round the corner and along an uphill road\\nfrom which you will obtain many delightful views. There is nothing on\\nthe Riviera to equal the position of some of the fine villas which line\\nthis road. Beautiful grounds run down to the sea. Exotic plants grow and\\nflourish, sheltered from the bitter tramontana wind. Great pine trees\\nrise solemnly above the tops of their Bay, such as is illustrated,\\nlead one up the steep slopes. Wherever one wanders, it is always the\\nblue sea that is below, and always the wonderful outline of the\\npeninsula across the Bay in the distance or the graceful curves on the\\nflanks of Mount Vesuvius, or, most beautiful of all, the lovely outline\\nof the enchanting Isola da Capri.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSALERNO\\n\\n\\nIn the Middle Ages the subject of this chapter was famous throughout\\nChristendom for its school of medicine. S. Thomas Aquinas tells us that\\nin the medical world Salerno ranked where Bologna did in law and Paris\\nin science. Had its fame on this account not been so great, Robert, the\\nson of William the Conqueror, would not have delayed his homeward\\njourney, and stopped there to consult its medical men for a wound he had\\nreceived in the Holy Land. In consequence of his absence from England,\\nHenry stepped on to the throne which had meanwhile become vacant by the\\ndeath of Rufus, and the rightful heir never reigned. Salerno was in many\\nother ways connected with the powerful race of Northmen. Robert Guiscard\\nreceived his mortal wound before the walls of the city as his troops\\nswept over the ramparts at the first assault after an eight months'\\nsiege. Roger the Norman was here declared king of Naples and Sicily at a\\nmeeting of the barons in 1130, and for many years Salerno was the seat\\nof the Norman government in South Italy. Like many another city which\\nhas in the past enjoyed a famous reputation and been of great\\nimportance, there is now practically nothing left to tell of its great\\ndays. On a crag at the end of the old city walls, some nine hundred feet\\nabove the sea, the ruins of the Northmen's stronghold, in the attack on\\nwhich Robert Guiscard was wounded, still remain, buffeted by the storms\\nthat rush up the mountain slopes. The harbour which Manfred commenced to\\nbuild, and which in old days held the Norman fleet, lies below the\\nMarina, but it silted up many years ago, and is now almost useless for\\ntrade. The great days of Salerno have gone, just as the great days of\\nher famous neighbour, Amalfi. The exigencies of modern trade routes and\\nthe facilities of the railway have robbed her of all the power and glory\\nshe once possessed.\\n\\nThere is, however, something left to remind one of her past wealth and\\npower. Closely hemmed in by its surroundings, the cathedral is not by\\nany means easy to find. Tortuous uphill streets lead to the piazza,\\nwhere, on a steep incline, a fine double flight of steps with a marble\\nbalustrade give on to the spacious cloistered court or atrium beyond\\nwhich it stands. Robert Guiscard dedicated his cathedral to S. Matteo,\\nand, so that it should be worthy of the great race of de Hauteville,\\nplundered the old Greek city of P\\u00e6stum for the building of it. Nearly\\nevery one of the pillars of these cloisters came from there. Most of\\nthem are so massive that the capitals of native workmanship, probably\\nhewn while the plundering was going on, are too small. The arches above\\nare stilted; they support a gallery whereon a row of statues of\\ndifferent archbishops appear in a now much delapidated condition. The\\nsame state of partial ruin greets the eye as one looks around. Fourteen\\nancient sarcophagi, nearly all of them Greek, stand in the cloisters of\\nthe court. They were used by the Normans for Christian burial, but,\\nalas! are mutilated and chipped at the corners, and their fine\\nbas-reliefs, one of a hunting scene, another with centaurs and nymphs on\\nthe panels, are almost completely ruined by the ill-treatment they have\\nreceived. In the centre of the court is a fountain. Water still splashes\\nin its Greek basin, but decay and neglect have robbed this otherwise\\nbeautiful atrium of most of its charm.\\n\\nThe cathedral adjoins the courtyard. The bronze doors of the central\\nporch were at one time inlaid with silver. The precious metal has\\ndisappeared, but small figures of the Apostles and Christian symbols\\nbear evidence that when these doors came fresh from Constantinople in\\nthe eleventh century they were of very fine craftsmanship. The interior\\nof the great church is whitewashed. The floor slopes up towards the\\neast end, and is a good example of a well arranged marble pattern. The\\nmost interesting things, if we except the tombs that are in the\\nbuilding, are the two ambones , or pulpits. That which appears in the\\nillustration is a wonderful example of the work of John of Procida. The\\nother, as well as the archbishop's throne, is by the same great\\ndesigner. All three are masterpieces of the Gr\\u00e6co-Byzantine style of\\ninlaid tesser\\u00e6 . In the illustration will be seen a fine Paschal\\ncandelabrum, with most intricate inlay, as fine in its way as that\\ndescribed in the next chapter. These pulpits are approached by steps\\nfrom inside the choir. One is supported by four columns of rare porphyry\\nand the other by twelve of granite from P\\u00e6stum. Age has toned the white\\nmarble panels to a light grey, which gives a wonderfully fine note to\\nthe white of the cathedral walls as one looks up the nave from the west\\nend. The choir is encircled with a most beautiful inlaid marble screen,\\nin decoration similar to the two pulpits. The floor is a grand example\\nof opus Alexandrinum inlay, and is as good in this respect as the best\\nin Italy.\\n\\n \\n\\nUnder the high altar, in the crypt, is a monument to S. Matthew, with a\\nseated bronze figure of the saint. Below this, in a casket, repose the\\nremains of the Evangelist, which were brought here in the year 930. The\\ncrypt itself is not interesting. To find what is, we must return to the\\nchurch above, where some of the tombs are well worthy of study. Pope\\nGregory VII., Hildebrand, who died in Salerno, lies in a sarcophagus in\\none of the side chapels. The remains of Margaret of Anjou, mother of\\nKing Ladislaus, rest under the canopy of a fine tomb, on which in relief\\nthe queen is depicted surrounded by her children and her maids of\\nhonour. Angels form the support to the canopy, which is decorated with\\ngold fleur-de-lys on a blue ground. Archbishop Caraffa's remains are in\\na fine Greek sarcophagus with Medusa heads at its corners. On another is\\na fine bas-relief of the Triumph of Bacchus, and many more, like those\\nin the cloisters, have been transferred from Pagan use to Christian. The\\nchapel in which is Hildebrand's tomb belongs to the family of John of\\nPrecida, who decorated it himself.\\n\\nIn the sacristy is a very interesting Palla of ivory, the thirty\\npanels of which represent scenes in the Old and New Testaments. This\\neleventh-century work is one of the few things which can with truth be\\nsaid to be in excellent preservation. The cathedral, like its\\nsurroundings, is sadly in need of repair. Its fine campanile is\\nbuttressed up, or would long ago have toppled into the street below. The\\ntwo lowest storeys of this grand tower are the original Norman work of\\nRoger's day. At their angles are marble and granite columns, no doubt\\nfrom P\\u00e6stum. The two upper storeys are not like the lower, built of\\nstone, but have been constructed in a very beautifully coloured brick.\\nThey are pierced by Norman arches, above which is the belfry surmounted\\nby a dome. Were it not for the few things we have noted, Salerno would\\nnot be worth a visit. But if only to see the magnificent pulpits and\\nstand silently in the crypt by the remains of the Evangelist, the\\ntourist in his hurry should never omit to spend at least a few hours in\\nthis once famous city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPALERMO\\n\\n\\nPhoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks and Romans, Goths, Byzantines,\\nNormans and Spaniards, have all ruled in Sicily; and those whose\\ncuriosity takes them to the museum of Palermo may there see many\\nantiquities of great interest in the history of each period. The man who\\nobserves may also see much in her streets. There are distinct quarters\\nin Palermo where the different races and their descendants have kept\\nthemselves to themselves from time immemorial. It takes no special\\nknowledge of racial physiognomy to single out among other types the\\nBerber or the Greek, as one saunters along watching the ever-changing\\ncrowd in the lively thoroughfares. The Norman occupation is recalled in\\nthe vivid decoration of the panels of the peasants' carts. On them one\\nsees the gallant Norman slaying the truculent Infidel -- slaying them by\\ndozens! Quite archaic is the execution of these panels -- the handiwork of\\na long line of painters, whose progenitors hundreds of years ago were\\npainting the same scenes on the vehicles of their day. The colours are\\ncrude. Every inch of the car is painted. The spokes of the wheels are\\nnotched and carved. The body of the cart is firmly fixed, high above the\\naxle bar, by well-arranged ironwork of floral design. There are no other\\ncarts in existence like them; and when the feathered plume of\\nultramarine and red which always adorns the donkey's headgear, and the\\ntinselled harness worked with gold and silver thread, are new, not many\\nchariots or state coaches make a braver show.\\n\\nPalermo is divided into four quarters by the two streets that, running\\neast and west, north and south, bisect one another at the circular space\\nin the centre of the city called the Quattro Canti -- the Four Corners.\\nStanding in this busy spot and looking downhill northwards, the deep\\nblue of the Mediterranean bounds the horizon. South the view is\\npartially stopped by the great city gateway, the arch of the Porta Nuova\\nwhich crosses the street by the Royal Palace nearly a mile away. East\\nand west, high over the heads of the crowd and the congested traffic,\\ngrand mountains rise up with a puff of white cloud above their summits.\\nIn whichever direction one gazes the vista ends, far beyond the lines of\\ntall houses, with the blue sea or the blue sky.\\n\\n \\n\\nIf one walks towards the Royal Palace up the hill, one passes through\\nthe fine Piazza del Duomo. It is a large square enclosed on three sides\\nby a marble balustrade, on which stand, at intervals, colossal statues\\nof bishops and saints. On the fourth side is the great cathedral. This\\nfine specimen of pointed Sicilian work is dedicated to S. Maria Assunta,\\nand was commenced in the twelfth century when Gualterio Offamilio,\\nWalter of the Mill, was the English archbishop of Palermo. The curious\\narchitectural style of the building is due to the fact that it was\\ndesigned by a Norman and carried out by Moorish workmen. The Moor found\\nit impossible to leave out his native arcades and his battlements; and\\nthe diaper pattern on the west fa\\u00e7ade recalls in design the decoration\\nof the east. The Saracenic capitals of the beautifully carved pillars of\\nthe three doors of this fa\\u00e7ade are exceptionally good. Norman zig-zag\\nmoulding embellishes the arches above. Niches filled with saints add to\\nthe harmonious incongruity so subtly arranged by infidel workmen. A\\nnoble tower at each corner rises in eight tiers, the three topmost being\\nopen. Throughout these towers small arches are supported by little\\nmarble columns with their corners rounded off in a bold way by ringed\\npillars. They terminate in little turrets and pinnacles, which have\\nflames at their bases. To break all the flat surfaces of these, the\\nEastern mind was constrained to put some sort of decoration, thus\\ncarrying off the appearance of great weightiness; and so, square,\\nbillet, lozenge, and nail-head patterns have been most admirably\\nintroduced. The lower portion of the great tower across the street and\\nopposite the fa\\u00e7ade, and which forms part of the archbishop's palace, is\\nSaracenic, and was erected before the Northman's advent in Sicily. The\\nupper stages are the belfry. Despite the spires which all these towers\\npossess, there is something decidedly more Eastern than Northern in\\ntheir appearance. The arches that cross the street -- so bold a feature in\\nthe sketch -- were put up in the twelfth century to sustain the palace and\\ncathedral whenever earthquake shocks occurred.\\n\\nThe cathedral is entered by the south porch. This is flanked by\\ntwelfth-century towers, on the top of which are ugly white marble\\nfigures, executed at a bad period. Three stilted arches of Moorish\\ndesign with cable mouldings, the central arch larger than the other two,\\nsupport a rather low gable. The face of this gable is covered with a\\ngood scheme of decoration. The cornice is deeply cut with animals and\\nfoliage, a porcupine and a hare being among the former. Four grotesque\\nNorman waterspouts break the string course between the cornice and a\\nbeautiful flat arcade under the arches, on which are half-length figures\\nof saints and bishops. The wall beneath this and above the three arches\\nof the porch was evidently at one time covered with Arab designs in\\nblack and red. Four grey marble pillars with their eastern capitals\\nsupport the arches; they came from the mosque which stood on the spot\\nwhere the cathedral was erected. The portal of the door itself is a real\\nmasterpiece of intricate Moorish carving. Here pomegranates and palm\\nleaves occupy a prominent place. In the eighteenth century many\\nalterations occurred, and this grand and, from an architectural point of\\nview, deeply interesting church, was disfigured to a large extent. The\\nporch has suffered almost as much as the interior of the building. But\\none tablet worth recording still exists in the former:\\n\\n PRIM . SEDES . CORONA . REGIS . ET . REGNI . CAPUT\\n\\nThus runs the proud title of the city in the days when the kings of\\nSicily were crowned in Palermo's cathedral. A row of white marble\\nfigures stands on the exterior of the side chapels of the aisles. They\\nare bad. Little domes with glazed tiles also remind one of a later\\nperiod. These, with the big central dome over the crossing, were the\\nwork of Fuga, a Neapolitan architect. In the alterations he carried out,\\nthe battlements and the corbel tables under them were spared. The latter\\nare a very curious study in the physiognomy of the different races known\\nto the Normans when the cathedral was built. Executed by Arab workmen,\\nwhose faith forbade them to portray the handiwork of Allah, their\\naccuracy is not unimpeachable. The east end is partly covered with flat\\narcading, most elaborately carved with Arabic design, and partly with a\\nblack and red pattern of the same character. The apse is not pierced by\\nany lights.\\n\\nThe white-washed classic interior is a great disappointment after the\\nrich brown and yellow stone of the exterior. But if, architecturally, it\\nfails to interest, historically it is concerned with the most brilliant\\nand prosperous period the city enjoyed. Turning to the left on entering\\nthe cathedral by the south porch are the two chapels wherein stand in\\nsolemn grandeur the mighty sarcophagi of the Norman and Swabian kings.\\nThe remains of Roger, the first Norman ruler of Sicily, rest in a\\nporphyry sarcophagus supported by marble feet composed of four crouching\\nSaracens. The fine canopy above is incrusted with mosaic. Its pillars\\nare gilded and inlaid. The next tomb is that of Constantia, who was the\\nlast of the royal line of Normans. She was the wife of the Emperor Henry\\nVI., and mother of Frederick II. By the side of this is the sarcophagus\\nof Henry VI. Very elaborately adorned is that which contains the remains\\nof Frederick II., and the body of Peter II. of Aragon. The lid of this\\nis carved with medallions of Christ, and the Virgin and child. All that\\nis left of Constance, wife of Frederick II., is in a Roman sarcophagus\\nwhich is recessed in a wall of the chapel. It is beautifully decorated\\nwith a hunting scene in bas-relief. Standing against another wall is a\\nmedi\\u00e6val tomb, with a cowled figure between two shields, on which are\\ndisplayed the eagles of Aragon. It holds the ashes of William, Duke of\\nAthens, who was a son of Frederick of Aragon. All these tombs are not\\nonly full of arch\\u00e6ological interest in themselves, but when one reviews\\nthe origin and history of the Norman occupation of the island, the\\nchapel in which they rest becomes one of the most historically absorbing\\nspots in the world.\\n\\nThe Saracens were in possession of Sicily when Roger, the youngest of\\nthe twelve sons of Tancred de Hauteville, came over from Apulia, where\\nhis brothers, by force of arms, had established themselves as reigning\\nCounts. Roger found all the civilisation, culture, and well-ordered\\nbureaucracy of the Moor firmly established. And with this he was too\\nwise to interfere. Changing nothing of the mode of life of those he\\nconquered, but simply adding to it the strength of arm and vitality of a\\nnorthern race, he became -- and those who followed him were -- by far the\\nrichest and most magnificent sovereigns of their time in all Europe.\\n\\nThe crypt is architecturally the most interesting part of the interior\\nof the cathedral. It contains the tombs of twenty-four of Palermo's\\narchbishops, including that of Walter of the Mill. Among the treasures\\nin the sacristy is the cap of Constance of Aragon, which was found in\\nher tomb, when, by order of Ferdinand I., the royal sarcophagi were\\nopened. On one of the rough gems with which the cap is studded, is\\nwritten in Arabic, \\\"In Christ, God, I put my hope.\\\" Here, again, is\\nevidence that the Moor and Christian lived amicably side by side.\\nTheodoric in Ravenna, and the Norman in Palermo, brought peace to the\\nland they conquered; and the greatest prosperity that both cities\\nenjoyed was a consequence of their wisdom, and of their religious\\ntolerance.\\n\\nIn the fine open square which one reaches at the end of the seemingly\\ninterminable Corso, a Roman house and other very interesting remains are\\nnow being unearthed. The Royal Palace occupies one side of the piazza,\\nand, being the highest part of the city, is on the site of the old Roman\\npalace. There is a magnificent view from the observatory situated on the\\nroof of the building. It is, however, with the beautiful chapel built by\\nRoger II. in the early part of the twelfth century that we are\\nconcerned. The Cappella Palatina is a perfect gem, and no one who has\\nonce visited it in the morning can ever forget the marvellous effect of\\ndim light passing through its narrow windows, and illuminating its\\nwonderful marble and mosaic walls. Three of the bays of the nave are\\nformed by columns of Egyptian granite which alternate with three of\\nfluted Greek marble. The composite capitals of the arches are Byzantine\\nand Corinthian. These arches are stilted and covered in an extremely\\nrich manner with gorgeous mosaic, and their soffits inlaid with\\n tesser\\u00e6 arranged in Moorish designs. The walls of the aisles are lined\\nwith the richest marble slabs, beneath which a beautiful dado of inlaid\\nEastern pattern runs round the chapel. The wooden roof of the nave is\\nhoneycombed, and like that of the Alhambra at Granada is arranged with\\nsplendidly coloured and gilded pendentives. Cufic inscriptions find a\\nplace amongst these hanging clusters. The ceilings of the aisles are\\ncoffered and sustain heavy gold bosses, which enrich the gorgeous effect\\nof their strong colour.\\n\\nThe choir is raised five steps above the nave, from which it is shut off\\nby a very beautiful marble screen. The stalls are carved perpendicular\\nwork. The fine wooden lectern of very late Gothic design has well-carved\\nangels kneeling on the four supporting legs. Above these angels four\\nkings stand around the centre column. On the book-rest repose the old\\nblack-letter parchment psalters. At the top of all, the Virgin and Child\\nfinish off this exceedingly well-designed and executed reading-desk.\\nBeyond the choir the apse rises four steps. The risers of these steps\\nand those of the choir are most beautifully inlaid. The colossal mosaic\\nfigure in the semi-dome of the apse is the only mosaic of a late date;\\nand, aiming at the qualities of a painting, like those on the exterior\\nof S. Mark's and the cathedral at Orvieto, somewhat mars the uniformity\\nand simplicity of the tesser\\u00e6 decoration of the chapel. The floor of\\nthe building is entirely opus Alexandrinum . At the west end, a raised\\ndais for the exclusive use of royalty is railed off, and a portrait of\\nthe reigning sovereign let into the marble panels of the wall. By the\\npulpit stands a Byzantine candelabrum. Four lions rending their prey are\\nat its base. Other animals and birds and figures of men, all fighting\\none another, encircle, in orderly confusion, the beautiful inlaid\\ncentral column. Above them is a figure of the Almighty, serenely\\nquiescent. Children, symbolical of innocence and freedom from sin, are\\ncarved round the bowl into which is stuck the huge Easter candle. It is\\nvery difficult to describe the effect of sudden calm that steals over\\none when, entering this dark church, with the glare of the sun and the\\nnoise of the streets outside, one is conscious of a very restful gloom,\\nfull of the richest colour, and a silence soothing to the senses. One\\nsomehow feels the gorgeousness of the east combined with the solemnity\\nof a well-planned sacred interior, and this despite the sudden\\ntransition from light to darkness. There is no other building of like\\ndimensions which grips one as does the wonderful Cappella Palatina of\\nPalermo.\\n\\nLa Martorana, away down in the city, may have been as beautiful, but\\nunfortunately in the year 1590 the nuns of the attached convent ordered\\nmost of the precious mosaics to be stripped from the walls, and a\\nhideous choir added when these were demolished. Some few are left on the\\nroof to tell us what a glorious thing this finely proportioned chapel\\nmust have been before religious zeal got the better of artistic taste.\\nThe central apse was likewise taken down a hundred years later, and with\\nit more priceless mosaic destroyed. The inlaid marble on the walls was\\ndone away with in the eighteenth century. If anything better could have\\nbeen found to take the place of the grand mosaics that covered the\\ninterior there might have been an excuse for these acts of vandalism but\\nwhen one sees the hideous stucco and wretched mural paintings of bad\\ndesign and colour, that have no religious fervour or tendency and\\nnothing whatever to recommend them in any way, one stands aghast at the\\nignorance and stupidity which in the name of religious expediency\\ndestroyed such priceless treasures. Among the little that remains are\\ntwo curious mosaics wherein King Roger is crowned by Christ, and the\\nHigh Admiral, who founded the church, is dedicating it to the Virgin.\\nThe king is wearing the dalmatic. This he received, together with the\\nmitre, from the Pope, who found it more diplomatic to confer\\necclesiastical office upon the Norman king than to oppose him in useless\\nwars.\\n\\nA little to the south of the Royal Palace, and almost abutting on the\\nold walls of the city, is S. Giovanni degli Eremiti. The beautiful\\ncloistered garden, which is adjacent, forms an illustration to this\\nchapter. The little church is a very early specimen of Norman work on\\nthe plan of the letter T with three apses. On its south side is a tiny\\nmosque, incorporated with the building and utilised in the old days as a\\nchapel. The monastery, which existed here in the time of Gregory the\\nGreat, had fallen into disuse when the Normans came to Sicily, and King\\nRoger restored the old buildings. The interior now is absolutely bare\\nand the windows unglazed. The Moorish domes give the little church a\\nvery eastern appearance, to which the flat members of the rustic stones\\nof the cloister arches in no small measure add. It is a peaceful spot\\nwhere exotic plants flourish luxuriantly, and vie with all sorts of\\nflowers in wanton growth.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe traveller who has been in Spain will find in the old quarter of\\nPalermo many palaces that will remind him of Seville, Salamanca, and\\nother places in the Iberian peninsula. The tawny colour of the South\\npredominates here, and the two or three courtyards possessed by many of\\nthese palaces will add to his reminiscences. This is not so strange as\\nit may seem when one considers that from the year 1282, when Pedro of\\nAragon was crowned king, to 1713, when Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy,\\nascended the throne, Sicily was under the rule of the Spaniard. The\\ngreat square block of yellow stone in the Piazza Marina, the Palazzo\\nChiaramonte, served as the palace of the Spanish Viceroys and\\nheadquarters of the Inquisition. Now known as the Palazzo de' Tribunali,\\nit is used as the law courts. The ante-chamber of the court room has a\\nmagnificent wooden ceiling. Hunting about in the narrow streets in this\\nquarter one chances on many a piece of architecture and decorative\\nsculpture in the grandiose style of the great days of Spain. One or two\\ngood fountains and fine portals add much to the historical charm of a\\npart of the city which is now occupied by humble folk. The church of S.\\nAgostino, difficult to find in the slums, has a remarkable fa\\u00e7ade with a\\nbeautiful wheel window. Delicate white marble pillars radiate from the\\nPaschal Lamb, which is the hub of the wheel, and three rows of tiny but\\nbeautifully-carved arches interlace and form the tracery of the window.\\nThe chevroned arches of the portal are decorated with acanthus leaves\\nand arabesques. The capitals of the supporting columns are pomegranates,\\nand a flat canopy with dripstone of acanthus leaves, beneath which are\\nalmost obliterated frescoes, completes one of the most fascinating\\nrelics of bygone days to be found anywhere in Palermo. It is in the old\\nquarters, too, that the life of the cittadini is seen in its most\\npicturesque garb. Fruit shops, full of golden oranges and pale lemons,\\nprickly pears and great citrons, make gay patches of colour in the\\nstreet vista. Glazed tiles, earthenware, and vividly coloured cotton\\ngoods displayed outside the shop fronts or hanging from the walls add to\\nthe variety of the scene. Cookshops, with pizzi and scaglozzi , and\\nolive oil in the frying pan, excite the olfactory nerves in a pleasanter\\ndegree than those in which a particularly strong-flavoured cheese finds\\nready purchasers. Excellent wine may be drunk at a very small cost at\\nthe drinking bars, where a jet of clear water is for ever playing over\\nthe marble slabs of the cistern-like counter. Fowls scurry about in\\nthe midst of the throng, and hungry dogs scent a meal in the refuse\\nheaps of the gutters. All is animation, and all has a touch of the South\\nthat is something more than Italian. It is almost worth while going to\\nPalermo in order to perambulate her fascinating streets and observe the\\never-changing crowd that peoples them.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is certainly worth the voyage to enter the harbour when the sun is\\nwell up and from the ship's deck watch the splendid panorama unfold\\nitself as the vessel glides into port. At the foot of Mte Pelligrino,\\nand where the famous valley of the Conca d'Oro, or Golden Shell, touches\\nthe blue waters of the Mediterranean, lies Palermo. Beyond, with an\\ninclination upwards to the lower slopes of Mte Cuccio in the distance,\\nstretches the triangular shaped valley, Mte Cuccio forming the apex of\\nthe triangle. Mountains hem the landscape in on two sides. The whole of\\nthe country between them and the sea is one vast grove of orange and\\nlemon trees. On the edge of the receding wall of mountains to the right\\nof the valley in the middle distance, a stately building stands above\\nthe brow of a steep hill. Round it cluster roofs and walls in irregular\\nlines. This is Monreale. To Monreale we go to study the mosaics. For\\nthough its cathedral boasts of grand twelfth-century bronze doors, and a\\nvery fine portico, the magnificent mosaics that cover the walls of the\\ninterior are its pride and glory.\\n\\nThe decoration of this fine basilica may be described as a coherent mass\\nof superb mosaics and well selected slabs of grey and white marble\\ninlaid with panels of Moorish design. Here more than in any other church\\nin the world has architecture been subordinated to a scheme of\\ngorgeously coloured decoration. Its Mosaics are Greek in style, with\\nGreek inscriptions. Moorish designs and arabesques also rival in colour\\nthe extraordinarily intricate gold pattern which sets off the beauty of\\nthe marble walls. On the semi-dome of the central apse is a very\\nimpressive colossal half-length mosaic of the Saviour holding an open\\nbook. Below, are figures of the archangels, Gabriel and Michael, and the\\ntwelve apostles. The vault of the south apse contains a gigantic figure\\nof S. Peter, and in the corresponding one in the north apse, one of S.\\nPaul. These two figures are robed in white, and light up the dark\\nrecesses of the deep-toned gold background of the apses in a remarkable\\nmanner. In the choir there is a mosaic over the royal throne very\\nsimilar to that in La Martorana, wherein King Roger is being crowned. In\\nthis case Christ places the crown on the head of William the Good. Over\\nthe Archbishop's throne William is represented offering the church to\\nthe Virgin. Sicily was never a fief of the Popes, and these two mosaics\\nno doubt express the idea that the sovereigns derived their authority\\nfrom God alone.\\n\\nRound the whole of the nave two sets or series of mosaics are arranged\\nwhich, beginning at the Flood, illustrate different episodes in biblical\\nhistory. Forty-two scenes are depicted in the nave and ten in each aisle\\nwhich deal with our Lord's life as well as themes from the Old\\nTestament. At the west end is a mosaic of S. Castrense, Monreale's\\ntutelar saint, casting out a devil, and also walking on the sea.\\n\\nComparing these wonderful decorations with those at Ravenna and in S.\\nMark's, one may at first be more impressed with the apparent\\nmagnificence of the scheme which we find here. The cathedral is larger\\nthan any of Ravenna's churches, and has this advantage over S. Mark's,\\nthat one is better able here to grasp at once the whole idea of the\\ncolour scheme. In S. Mark's one sits and quietly discovers things at\\nleisure. At Monreale one enters and is immediately overpowered by the\\nmagnificence of the dull gold tesser\\u00e6 and the gorgeous arrangement of\\nthe sequence of figures which, like a flash, strike one at first sight.\\nRavenna can show us better schemes of colour, subtler and more refined.\\nRavenna gives us earlier work, and work more na\\u00efve, and is for this\\nreason more attractive and interesting. But it must be admitted that in\\nno other building of the kind is one impelled to stop suddenly and catch\\none's breath, as when first entering Monreale's great basilica.\\n\\nEight bays divide the nave from the aisles. Their stilted arches are\\nsupported by granite monoliths. The capitals of these are pure\\nCorinthian, and Corinthian with cornucopi\\u00e6 volutes and medallion heads.\\nAbove the abacus of each capital is the simple Norman bowl capital\\ninlaid with rich mosaic. It is from these that the glorious\\ncolour-scheme springs -- above and around, the eye finds nothing but\\nmosaic. The lower portion of the walls of the aisles is composed of\\nmarble slabs separated from one another by inlay of Moorish design. In\\nthe north chancel aisle are the tombs of Roger, Duke of Apulia, and\\nHenry, Prince of Capua, two sons of William the Bad. In the south\\nchancel aisle are the tombs of William the Good and William II. Just as\\nPalermo's cathedral is a fit resting-place for the remains of some of\\nthe Norman kings, so is this grand fabric for the bodies of those of the\\nsame royal line who here repose in peace.\\n\\n \\n\\nAdjoining the cathedral, on the south side, is all that is left of the\\noriginal Benedictine monastery. The celebrated cloisters, of which we\\nspeak, are more Arab than Norman, and more infidel than Christian in\\ntheir architecture. The two flat members of the Moorish arches are\\ndecorated with black tufa lozenges and spearheads. The coupled columns\\nare nowhere approached in beauty and delicacy, save in S. Paolo fuori at\\nRome. Arabesques cover some of them; all were at one time richly inlaid\\nwith mosaic. Some are chevroned, others of lozenge pattern, or billeted,\\nor twisted and spiral. Their capitals are one and all of extreme\\ninterest. One shows on its carved surface Norman knights in chain mail\\nengaged in combat with Saracens; another, Roman gladiators slaying\\nChristian victims. Birds, beasts, and subjects from the Old Testament,\\nintricate foliage and vines add to a variety which is not to be found\\nanywhere else in the cloistered courts of Italy. The illustration gives\\na corner of this beautiful spot where a fountain splashes and plays,\\nadding to the delights of a well-kept garden and the sweet scent of\\nflowers.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Freeman\\nPublisher: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS\\nPlace of publication: New York / London\\nDate: 1893\\n\\nArezzo.\\n\\n\\nThe city of M\\u00e6cenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,\\nshows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There\\nis some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,\\nand, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief\\nbuildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be\\nbought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among\\nthem surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that\\nclear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with\\nnourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different\\nways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having\\nyet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if\\nthe city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the\\nfirst rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both\\nforms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of\\nPisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect\\nof the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim\\na day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from\\nFlorence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.\\n\\nArezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities\\nwhich sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,\\nlike Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.\\nIt has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which\\npresently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself\\nin the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have\\nto be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect\\nof the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we\\ninstinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as\\na whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs\\nsome of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem\\nto borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it\\nwere covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several\\nsmall hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all\\nsides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast\\nsnowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the\\ncharacter of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a\\ngood deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a\\ngeneral view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to\\nthe left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must\\nclimb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean\\nfortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has\\ngardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about\\nat large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in\\nthe general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line\\nof the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except\\nwhere they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;\\nsurely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this\\nobject. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly\\ntheir whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit\\nit is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest\\nin some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show\\nside. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern\\nrailway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually\\ndescending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the\\ninhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from\\nopen fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it\\nis with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral\\nand the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without\\ntaking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of\\nArezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give\\nus either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of\\nmedi\\u00e6val towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect\\nin Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription\\nwhich illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed\\nsovereign Cosmo appears as \\\"Duke of Florence and Siena.\\\" He had\\ninherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;\\nmeanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the\\nhigher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\n\\nIn the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one\\ndominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral\\nchurch, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the\\ntown, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the duomo \\nis the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant\\nfeature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises\\namong a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of\\nthem, the great campanile of St. Mary della Pieve , though the body\\nof its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to\\nthe cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not\\nungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest\\narchitectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show\\nitself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and\\nthe town-tower, and that hard by the duomo ; but they do not hold,\\neven comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows\\nin the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a\\ncity which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical\\ncharacter was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of\\nArezzo, keeps -- though not on its old site -- his splendid tomb in the\\n duomo , on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles\\nwhich he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown\\nat his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of\\nhouses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building\\nbesides the churches is the front of that called the Fraternit\\u00e0 dei\\nLaici , in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of\\nArretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,\\nbut so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,\\nit contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show\\nin many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are\\nthe huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other\\nvast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.\\nNaturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones\\nwere no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as\\nrelics of the G\\u00e6tulian beasts of Hannibal.\\n\\nSomething may be picked up here and there in the other churches of\\nArezzo; but it is Santa Maria della Pieve which is the real object\\nof study. The duomo is absolutely without outline; it is a single\\nbody with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.\\nBut its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than\\nis common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the\\nGerman hand to which tradition attributes the building. The church of\\n La Pieve is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.\\nIts four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been\\nfinished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;\\nthe west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor\\nits defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which\\nnothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at\\nLucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column\\ncapitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its\\nlowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.\\nThe arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so\\nthey are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium\\nshows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The\\narches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well\\nas those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of\\nprodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is\\nquite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;\\nthe arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The\\nsouth side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:\\nbut it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient\\nbuilding on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the\\nwest front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished\\nfrom Arezzo. The \\\"Tyrrhena regum progenies\\\" have here left but small\\ntraces behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCortona.\\n\\n\\nFrom Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height\\n\\n ... Cortona lifts to heaven\\n Her diadem of towers.\\n\\nIf the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the\\nwalls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,\\nsuggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their\\nrace, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not\\nwin victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer\\nseems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with\\nClitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The\\njourney is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we\\nmight well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione\\nFiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern\\nhill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers\\na hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione\\ndistinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height\\nwhich it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.\\nWe have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the\\nheight, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and\\nCorinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of\\nthe younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,\\nas at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has\\nnever come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has\\nbecome at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas\\nis forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of\\nthe ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a\\ncity like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \\\"diadem\\nof towers\\\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of\\ntowers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any\\naccount in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make\\nup an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,\\nthere is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well\\nforsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the\\nplain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city\\nitself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it\\nthat we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site\\nitself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world\\nthat there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main\\ninterest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased\\nthat everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and\\nthat the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the\\nEtruscan walls.\\n\\nIn truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that\\nCortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had\\nfound only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which\\nlater times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost\\namong the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been\\ngreat in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little\\naccount that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the\\nground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just\\nat that time came its short period of anything like importance among\\nthe cities of medi\\u00e6val Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth\\ncentury, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.\\nYet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though\\nwe can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a\\ncity, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the\\nyounger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional\\nvisitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;\\nanother persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the\\nancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona\\nis emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own\\ncompany.\\n\\nAs an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,\\nthrough the regular stages of Roman colony and medi\\u00e6val commonwealth,\\nCortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of\\nits being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing\\nthat can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and\\nmonasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some\\ncontain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps\\nmarks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that\\nits cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.\\nThe duomo stands about half-way up the height within the town, on\\na corner of the walls. Its elegant Renaissance interior has been\\nalready spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building\\nthe columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper\\ncity where we should have looked for the duomo is occupied by the\\nChurch of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over\\nher portal as \\\"p\\u0153nitens Margarita,\\\" marked off thereby alike from\\nthe virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal\\nbuildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio\\nmust be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly\\ncoated as it is with the arms of successive podestas . Of private\\npalaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not\\non its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.\\nFrom the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the\\nacropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.\\nThe Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins -- not an\\nusual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its\\nditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed\\nfabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which\\nthe visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local\\nimportunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points\\nof view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done\\nfirst of all -- that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing\\nthat makes Cortona what it is.\\n\\nThe process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in\\nsome measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.\\nHappily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in\\nby far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan\\nrampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no\\nsmall height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,\\nbut still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood\\nin the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is\\nreason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must\\nremember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the\\ndays of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman\\nworks. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the\\none remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might\\nalmost have stood at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. On the highest point, the hindermost\\npoint, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside\\nan inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,\\nthe Etruscan wall has largely given way to the medi\\u00e6val fortress whose\\npresent aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only\\nto leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an\\noutpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of\\nthe whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seemingh\\nto stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the\\nhistory of Cortona in stone and brick.\\n\\nFrom the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and\\nthe other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,\\nthe glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chim\\u00e6ra is the glory\\nof the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought\\nwith endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a\\nfemale head, which we might at first take for the work of Renaissance \\nhands, and in which those who are skilled in such matters profess to\\nrecognize the existing type of Cortonese beauty. The painting however\\ndates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps\\nher ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their\\nskulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her\\npresent people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features\\nwere copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living\\ncountenance of one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerugia.\\n\\n\\nThe hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of medi\\u00e6val Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmedi\\u00e6val and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch's \\\"Life of Timole\\u00f4n,\\\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr\\u00e6historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.\\n\\nThe difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the\\nabiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical\\ndifference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if\\nwe will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of\\nPerugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona\\nsits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but\\non a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several -- possibly\\nseven -- outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.\\nThe Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of\\na very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and\\noutlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is\\nonly in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain\\nthe present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that\\nwe can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly\\na hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,\\nwhile the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.\\nBut Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the\\nplain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it\\nhas happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona\\nis not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long\\nperiod of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all\\nthe way from its railway station to its municipal palace.\\n\\nAt Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws\\nto itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\\n\\nPerugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as\\nreceptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked\\non. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At\\nthe two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on\\nthe Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.\\nAngelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long\\nseries of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to\\nLudlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with\\nits beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one\\nof the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other\\nend, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble\\nranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building\\nat its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the duomo \\nitself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it\\nshows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and\\nits pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not\\nchurches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from\\nother things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one\\nclass alone -- Augusta Perusia itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Volumnian Tomb.\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern\\nFreemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the\\nouter world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have\\nread various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,\\nits constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us\\nthe fullest particulars: we have only to complain that the historical\\npart is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should\\nnot like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient\\nin the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty\\nany further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact\\nduties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we\\nshould answer, not \\\"Amen,\\\" but \\\"So mote it be.\\\" Still, what Freemasonry\\nis, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a\\nFreemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books\\nleave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to\\nknow everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can\\nknow a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom\\nwe seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as\\nto the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,\\nand belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their\\nbuildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they\\nlived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan\\nbooks; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless\\ninscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language\\nwas, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,\\nhalf-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as\\nthe mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here\\nand there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one\\ningenious man has read it all into good German and another into good\\nTurkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like\\na Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything\\nin three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light\\non a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For\\nsurely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead\\nletter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,\\nbut at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.\\n\\nIt is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments\\nof a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part\\nof the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the\\ncollections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if\\nwe are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or\\nshall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly\\nEtruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes\\nlargely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this\\nmust specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have\\nleft no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly\\nfair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like\\nthe Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But\\nsuppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have\\nin the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek\\nor Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral\\nelement would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly\\ndominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be\\nso distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.\\nTake a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does\\nnot of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference\\nto the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven\\non the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in\\nthe Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye\\nand the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than\\neven the chim\\u00e6ra, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various\\nsizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.\\nThe departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the\\nuninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance\\nto divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is\\ndesigned to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the\\n Lucumonissa -- if we may coin so medi\\u00e6val a form -- lies apart, sometimes\\nalong with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to\\nbring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious\\nrace than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.\\n\\nBut if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\\n\\nWe are not describing at length what may be found described at length\\nelsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures\\nwhich gives them a strange and special interest. This is their\\nstrangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but\\nso are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch\\nof Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo\\nreclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly medi\\u00e6val recumbent\\nfigure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,\\nsay in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures\\non the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give\\nus living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the\\nRasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient\\nworks which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.\\nAnd nowhere do the sculptures look fresher -- almost modern -- than when\\nseen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the\\nsepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi.\\n\\n\\nThere is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of\\nmischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite\\ndifferent from that which makes the place famous with the world in\\ngeneral. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious\\nerror. When so many members of Parliament showed a few years back,\\nand when the Times showed only a very little time back, that they\\nbelieved that the University of Oxford was founded by somebody -- Alfred\\nwill do as well as anybody else -- and that the city of Oxford somehow\\ngrew up around the University, it became, and it remains, a duty to\\nhistoric truth to point out the importance of Oxford, geographical and\\ntherefore political and military, for some ages before the University\\nwas heard of. When the Times thought that Oxford was left to the\\nscholars, because \\\"thanes and barons\\\" did not think it worth struggling\\nfor, the Times clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford\\nthen, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because\\nOxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,\\nflourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat\\nof councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;\\nin other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,\\nwhile the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly\\nworthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects\\nwhich are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible\\nthat some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the\\nchurch and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the\\nerror is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the\\ncity of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis\\nand his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and\\nworld-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully\\nworthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on\\nages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place\\nwell worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and\\nthough his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light\\nmatter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very\\nunlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before\\nhim and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace\\nof the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called\\n\\\"seraphica civitas,\\\" before one of its later churches came to rank with\\nthe patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early\\nmedi\\u00e6val city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still\\nexist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a\\nkind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The\\nsaint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could\\nhe have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,\\nand doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow\\nstream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral\\nchurch of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the\\nGreat Twin Brethren.\\n\\nAssisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless\\nvarieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which\\nwe have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on\\nwhich it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge\\nmountain. As at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea, while the akropolis is high enough, there is\\nsomething far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis\\nof Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of\\nshelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The duomo \\nstands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top\\nof the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is\\nno small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the\\nremains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond\\nit, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling\\nof man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost\\nmore needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not\\nonly for the medi\\u00e6val walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark\\nan outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow\\nvalley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at\\ntheir feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the\\nglimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only\\nless wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb\\nfrom the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but\\nthere the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes\\nall the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,\\ngives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure\\nto the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a\\ncity running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of\\nbell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general\\neffect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,\\ncrowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except\\nthe steep of the mountain itself.\\n\\nOf particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a\\nrestriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,\\nSaint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest\\ninterest is the temple in the forum -- now Piazza grande -- with its\\nCorinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on\\nthe other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned\\ninto a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple\\nof Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting\\npart of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at\\nAssisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple\\nmust have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper\\nones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,\\nwith the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on\\nthe Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those\\ncomments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient\\nJewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the\\nsynagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is\\nthe dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,\\nand the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates\\nand people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great\\ncollection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it\\ndown quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the\\ndedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number\\nof inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,\\nthere are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best\\nworth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and\\noculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of\\nthe Sexviri for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,\\nand left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly\\nbrought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his\\ncoachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are\\nset thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of\\nforeign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and\\non the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements\\nwere practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of\\nAssisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less\\ngood a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.\\n\\nThe temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most\\nmemorable things in Pr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things\\nbesides, both Roman and medi\\u00e6val. The lower church of Sta. Maria\\nMaggiore , close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been\\nthe original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German\\nlook, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into\\nthe mind that it is the cella of a temple with arches cut through\\nits walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local\\nfashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter\\nhard by. Besides, at Sta. Maria Maggiore there are the clear remains\\nof a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,\\nunderneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has\\nbeen sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth\\ncentury, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,\\nand it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the\\ncrypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,\\nand Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above\\nare scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier\\nremains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the\\nsurrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman chester \\nabide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is\\nmodern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the Via San Paolo \\nleading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above\\nground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many\\nmemorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in\\nclimbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while\\nboth Saint Francis and Saint Clara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpello.\\n\\n\\nThe Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many\\ngates its full description as \\\"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia\\nCostante,\\\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum\\nor as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most\\nlikely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in\\none of its churches. Somebody must come to see them, or their keepers\\nwould not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them\\ncovered, in hopes of earning a lira by uncovering them. May we make\\nthe confession that we became aware -- or, to speak more delicately,\\nthat we were reminded -- of the existence of the colony at once Julian\\nand Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German\\nguide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel\\nthoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,\\nyet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and\\nthat, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman\\nmonuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more\\nperfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the\\nwonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we\\nshould hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;\\nbut a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is\\nno one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but\\nthere are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some\\nimportance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the\\nplace, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as\\nSpello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less\\nuntouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.\\nWe except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the medi\\u00e6val\\nhouses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.\\nBut that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong\\nin some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at\\nSpello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to\\nseize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the\\nfinest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains\\nand ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,\\nand the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers\\nand cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The medi\\u00e6val walls and towers,\\nat all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not\\neasily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the\\nantiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in\\nmere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps\\na little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not\\ndisappointing.\\n\\nAt Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;\\neven in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one\\nhand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no duomo , nor is\\nthere any other church of much architectural importance. The best are\\ntwo small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each\\nside of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building\\nof a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group\\nlying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There\\nis a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;\\nby its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the\\namphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with\\nits marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre\\nis down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the\\npresent city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original\\nRoman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever\\nthe influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed\\nwith so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from\\nSpello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments\\nwhich are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the\\nbuilding is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of\\nits bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;\\nother fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when\\nwe reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it\\nis its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.\\n\\nAs we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia\\nConstans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which\\nbears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the\\nconsular gate is reached only through a medi\\u00e6val one, which bears, as\\nwe have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the\\nstranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:\\nfor Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty\\nof climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in\\ncontinuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been\\npatched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single\\nsimple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to\\nthe lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,\\nknown as Porta Veneris , must have been a far more elaborate design.\\nBut the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double\\nentrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet\\nthere is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal\\ntowers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,\\nhigher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch\\nhanging in the air. This is locally known as the arco di trionfo . Of\\nthe arco di Augusto within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of\\nMacrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman\\nremains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and\\nfragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them\\nout. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival\\nVerona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain\\nperverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what\\nhas been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the\\nend of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match\\nthe mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one\\njourney. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to\\nspend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must\\nhurry on to aurea Roma herself, even though we have to rush by many a\\ntown and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest\\nof all, by\\n\\n ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,\\n The fortress of Nequinum lowers\\n O'er the pale waves of Nar.\\n\\nMarry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,\\npresents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to\\nhave come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the\\nRoman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Qu\\u00e6stor Bacchus -- it\\nis taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot\\nhelp Latinizing the Questore Bacco -- puts out another set of placards\\nto forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among\\nour memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a\\nsecession; we might almost expect to see once more\\n\\n ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.\\n\\nBut those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede\\neven to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the Sala\\nDante .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeii.\\n\\n\\nThe student of what M. Amp\\u00e8re calls \\\"L'Histoire Romaine \\u00e0 Rome\\\" must\\ntake care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history\\nof Rome -- and the local history of Rome is no small part of the\\n\\u0153cumenical history -- is not fully understood unless we fully take in\\nthe history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.\\nWith Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and\\nher allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made\\npart of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And\\nfirst on the list may well come the city which was before all others\\nthe rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of\\ndestruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through\\na country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with\\nthe heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has\\nutterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left\\nwithin the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we\\nare close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by\\na rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,\\nan inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the\\nfirst great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'\\nsiege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the\\nHellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such\\nas are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of\\nliving things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria\\nnothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some\\nconvulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,\\nand tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a\\nrace with whom death counted for more than life.\\n\\nA sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand\\nsome points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival\\nof Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,\\nwe understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the\\nhatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked\\non the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange\\na greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the\\ngreat border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate\\nneighbours which could contend with her on equal terms. Elsewhere, in\\nher early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace\\nor war with whole confederations.\\n\\nThe happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky\\ngroup of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great\\nas all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what\\nclearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And\\nwhen the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the\\ncharacter of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,\\nit is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city\\nwhich had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the\\nstage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing\\nRome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome\\nwould be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near\\ntogether could not go on together. Two cities, very great according\\nto the standard of those times, considerable according even to a\\nmodern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and\\neverything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the\\nmodern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours\\non its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and\\ndinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt\\nall the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while\\nRome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of\\nher dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,\\nconfederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come\\nsooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.\\n\\nThe site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city\\nmade, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing\\nlike the \\\"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\\\" Veii is\\nnot a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,\\nyet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above\\nthe steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the\\nfateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a\\ntable-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an\\nadmirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by\\nthe walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid\\nout on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as\\nin so many cases, the arx , a peninsula within a peninsula, was the\\noriginal city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,\\nit would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii\\ntook a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual\\ngrowth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted\\nextent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a\\ncity which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not\\nspread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the\\noccupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed\\nan old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber\\nbelow their walls.\\n\\nIt is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and\\nextent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which\\ncan be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in\\nthe circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring -- the Ponte\\nSodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.\\nBesides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs\\nof a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after\\ntimes arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains\\nof the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.\\nThere is the Roman columbarium , within the Etruscan site; there\\nare the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There\\nis, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures\\nand inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian\\nsepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment\\nto see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the\\nunaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the\\narms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive\\nform and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no\\nwritten \\u00e6nigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by\\nmarking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage\\nby far than the roof of Rome's Tullianum or its fellow at Tusculum.\\nIn the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it\\nbelongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from\\nEtruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes\\nfrom the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman\\nhistory, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think\\nit. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know\\nthat, except the palpable remains of the Roman municipium , nothing\\ncan be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.\\nIn the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by\\nconquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early\\nstage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same\\ndate, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;\\nthe only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and\\nhalf-Hellenic Macedonia.\\n\\nWe turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how\\nutterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman\\nhistory. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,\\ninasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.\\nBut that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in\\nRome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has\\nstretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be -- all this\\nwe understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of\\nLivy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiden\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nFrom the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the arx of\\nFiden\\u00e6 as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel\\nGiubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence\\nof Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other\\nthings sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to\\nhave been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems\\ndesigned as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter\\nof fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan\\noutpost on Latin soil. Whether Fiden\\u00e6 was really such an outpost in the\\nstrict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion\\nof the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was\\na Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the\\nEtruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally\\nof Veii, that Fiden\\u00e6 made itself memorable. If we accept the received\\nstory, the war which brought about the ruin of Fiden\\u00e6 was caused\\nbecause its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,\\nperhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus\\ntook so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,\\nand the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus\\nformed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We\\nmay believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least\\nwere real, if the witness of Augustus C\\u00e6sar is to be believed.\\n\\nEach of the roads which lead out of Rome -- since the railway came,\\nthere is practically only one way which leads into Rome -- has its own\\nspecial interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to\\nthe Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in\\nits material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations\\nis perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian\\ngate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing\\nto itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall\\nof Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by\\nthe Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in\\nthe new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline\\ngate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of\\nRome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of\\ndefence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome\\nmarched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to\\nput down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after\\nthe slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those\\nwho did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.\\nBefore the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the\\ndominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.\\nAnd when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the\\nnew entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that\\nher political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral\\ndominion was stronger than ever. \\\"At midnight the Salarian gate was\\nsilently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous\\nsound of the Gothic trumpet.\\\" And if these gates were a centre of\\nfighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of\\nburying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs\\nhere and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but\\nthis quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials\\nwhich is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline gate was the\\nliving tomb of unchaste vestals; not far beyond the Salarian we come\\nto the Christian c\\u0153meterium Priscillae . We go on; we descend the\\nhill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the\\nalluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting\\nof the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might\\nseem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived\\nand gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken\\ndown and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those\\nof Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but\\nif we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must\\nhave been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly\\nnew when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come\\nto another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a medi\\u00e6val\\ntower; the medi\\u00e6val tower now proclaims itself as an \\\"osteria\\\"; but\\nwe feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now\\nfairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills\\nbeyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills\\nof Fiden\\u00e6 are before us. To the right lies the ground between the\\nSalarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his\\nmaster Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the\\nrailway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with\\nTiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between\\nhills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a\\nrange of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to\\nthe right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fiden\\u00e6, in the pass which\\ndivides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on\\nthe inland side.\\n\\nThe arx of Fiden\\u00e6, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,\\na height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer\\nto them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river\\nleaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that\\nside rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city\\ncould look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of\\nthe small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,\\nthe Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii\\nitself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the arx \\nof Fiden\\u00e6 and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.\\nInland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when\\nFiden\\u00e6 was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place\\nagainst the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the\\nrest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original\\n arx . We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its\\n cloaca , the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley\\nby the brook between the lower hill of Fiden\\u00e6 and the hill which lies\\nbetween Fiden\\u00e6 and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It\\nwas no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground\\nas the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand\\nwhy Rome on the first opportunity swept Fiden\\u00e6 utterly away, while the\\nexistence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.\\n\\nAs at Veii, so at Fiden\\u00e6, the traces of the living are gone -- yet more\\nutterly at Fiden\\u00e6 than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more\\nplentiful, though Fiden\\u00e6 has nothing to set against the painted tomb of\\nVeii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won\\nthe spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fiden\\u00e6 as a deserted place,\\nthe possession of a single man. Yet the potestas of Fiden\\u00e6 -- perhaps\\nits dictator -- may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered\\non in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntemn\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nIt is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography\\nthat its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal\\ncharms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that\\nit has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.\\nThe merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages\\nback. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of\\nall ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are\\nof one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no\\nmonuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it\\nwill be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to\\nthis kind of research. At Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6 the great merit is that\\nthere is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the\\nmore to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fiden\\u00e6\\nuntouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;\\nbut we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.\\nAnd no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 full of Roman\\nand medi\\u00e6val monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,\\nas they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But\\nwe turn from Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 to a city compared with which Veii and\\nFiden\\u00e6 might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,\\nan exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fiden\\u00e6. The\\nsites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside\\nthe sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much\\nnearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it\\ndoes not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,\\neven more truly than at Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6, say that the very ruins\\nhave perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished\\nyet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special\\nattraction of its own.\\n\\nWe took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemn\\u00e6 both from the road to the\\nWhite Hens and from the road to Fiden\\u00e6. As we before said, it ought\\nto be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things\\nare not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh\\nfrom the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the\\nMilvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the\\noldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,\\nto let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that\\nof Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when\\nthe bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic\\nenemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood\\nthe host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius\\nor of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,\\nand how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time\\nwe keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We\\nare therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite\\nanother part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,\\nwho is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.\\nOur present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with\\nBelisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome\\nwas, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We\\nwalk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with\\nthe eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the\\nEtruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,\\nboth come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,\\nthat it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary\\nstream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct\\nand hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie\\nof origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the\\nmost frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor\\nwere sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a\\ndenizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was\\nlike handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path\\nkeeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at\\nall, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a\\nrocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside\\nthe Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters\\nwhen Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.\\nBut, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on\\na site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient\\nsettlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells\\nof any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in\\nthe hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy\\nhill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern\\nside by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemn\\u00e6, a vanished\\ncity whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive\\nwords. Antemn\\u00e6 was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose\\ndaughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers\\ncalled Quenfang , what sociologists called exogamy , which secured\\nthat the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;\\nRome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of\\nnobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemn\\u00e6 is merged, in Rome. We\\nmay be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which\\ngive Antemn\\u00e6 a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to\\nbe that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the\\nsite was, as now, like Fiden\\u00e6, the possession of a single man.\\n\\nThe story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus\\nspares at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.\\nParted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern\\npoint, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at\\nthe very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the\\ndescriptive name Antemnae , the town before the rivers. Such a site\\nbelongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the\\nPalatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was\\nwhile it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive\\nname, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree\\nof progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from\\nthe oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without\\nthe Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like\\nRome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which\\nmust cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be\\nincorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.\\n\\nOf a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that\\nwe can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the\\nsite. Antemn\\u00e6 has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some\\nstones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to\\nbe part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise\\ngreen hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.\\nBut the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates\\nare as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those\\nof Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fiden\\u00e6 and its surroundings, on\\nthe old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge\\nof Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the\\nGaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and\\nsome of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly\\nthe whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's\\n\\\"turriger\\u00e6 Antemn\\u00e6.\\\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the\\ntowers thereof than we were at Veii and Fiden\\u00e6. At Antemn\\u00e6 the ruins\\nthemselves have perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOstia.\\n\\n\\nFrom the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight\\nremains which mark the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6, from the almost more\\ninstructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemn\\u00e6, we may\\nwell pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any\\nof them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because\\nit was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This\\nis the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an\\nearly stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what\\nRome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making\\nRome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to\\npossess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once\\nmarked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland\\ntowns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and\\nnothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven\\nof Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes\\nOstia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.\\nAnd the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to\\nsupport it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as\\nproving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period\\nwhich is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,\\nperiod. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal\\nAncus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that\\nthe events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep\\nourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition\\nthen calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is\\nthat whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,\\nand that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.\\n\\nThis at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities\\nof that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime\\nenterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.\\nCorinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain\\ncitadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth\\nstarted in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.\\nIt marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies\\nabsolutely in the sea -- Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on\\nher peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland\\nAthens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on\\nthe broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand\\nthe value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or\\nVeii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet\\nmore. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or\\neven Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful\\nfor her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There\\nwere inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no\\ninland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.\\nIndeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime\\nor otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had\\nno separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a\\ndistance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.\\n\\nOstia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is\\neminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of\\nthose fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He\\nhas changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a\\nlittle dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which\\nhave been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,\\nand they have brought to light much that is most interesting and\\ninstructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in\\nvain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon\\nas they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its\\npavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,\\nleads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end\\nis gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to\\nthe stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to\\nimitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his\\nsuccessor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside\\nthe mouth of the cloaca maxima ; make a strong wall of defence against\\nthe waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long\\nas the cloaca maxima itself.\\n\\nAnd what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small\\npart of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia\\nis becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a\\nsomewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first\\nwith the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment\\never happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery\\nof Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at\\nwidely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing\\nwhich is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there\\nor anywhere else -- namely, destruction by the Saracens in the fifth \\ncentury, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \\\"Handbook,\\\" but which was\\ncertainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored\\nby Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as\\nthe haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards\\novercame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for\\nit. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change\\nwhich it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour\\nof Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to\\nlive on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings\\nlater than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with\\ngraceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is\\nabundant evidence that all through the second century of our \\u00e6ra great\\narchitectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there\\nis the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so\\nproudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions\\nsupply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be\\ntoo much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which\\ncertainly suggests that of Arles.\\n\\nIn the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he\\ncomplains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course\\nof the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is\\neminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,\\nsome rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber\\nmakes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,\\nif Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of\\nwalls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,\\namong the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides\\nof a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,\\nbelonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were\\nclearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall\\nwas broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;\\nthey chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best\\nsuited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may\\nwell have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The\\nwall of Servius had ceased to serve any military purpose, and the wall\\nof Aurelian was not yet.\\n\\nThe history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain\\nattempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into Gregoriopolis ,\\nbelongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its\\ncastle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but\\nwith seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old\\nOstia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart custode , who defends\\nhimself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle\\nof Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the\\ncathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which\\nnothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;\\nthe staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among\\ncardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the\\nolder site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated\\nstate. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a\\nstreet dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses\\nitself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,\\nleaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.\\nAt Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is\\ndug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the\\nfar greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are\\ncontent; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and\\nMother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with\\nFather Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our\\nguide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,\\nset forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly\\nminded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alban Mount.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places\\nwhich bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie\\nso far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different\\nnations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of\\nconnexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has\\nsettled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must\\nnot forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell\\nin the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or\\nAlbany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic\\nwas lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,\\nshe spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that\\nshe might have answered with a tu quoque or something more; the\\nEnglishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.\\nBut have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with\\nthe Duke of Al v a -- for in his tongue \\\"non aliud est v i v ere quam\\n b i b ere\\\" -- or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is\\nsingular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of\\nRome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as\\nthose by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and\\nthose Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.\\nIt is \\u1fec\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1\\u1fd6\\u03bf\\u03b9 and \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af in both cases, without the change of jot or\\ntittle. In this case, at least, we believe that philologers would deny\\nthe slightest kindred between the names; but the casual identity is\\nthereby only made the more startling. A malicious critic might say\\nthat Anna's Romans were as unlike old Romans as her Albanians could be\\nunlike the men of Alba Longa. But her Romans did at least claim to be\\nRomans, sharers in the inheritance of the wolf and the eagle; while\\nher Albanians certainly laid no claims to any rights in the Alban sow\\nand her thirty pigs.\\n\\nRome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly\\nthat its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in\\nderivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount\\nkept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There\\nis the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely\\ninterwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road\\nby which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still\\nthe displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre\\nof the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the\\npillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of\\ncrowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes\\nhis eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she\\ndid in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as\\nfavourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood\\nof living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,\\naccording to one version of his story, his body -- or perhaps only his\\nhead -- found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the\\nAlexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had\\nso many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all Albana ,\\nthe Albanum of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long\\nterraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The\\nwalled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Pr\\u00e6torian\\ncamp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still\\nexists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still\\nkeeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,\\nseek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano\\nand Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.\\nIn both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in\\nthe neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between\\nthem, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample\\nruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato\\nstood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in\\nher day of overthrow.\\n\\nThe town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most\\nprominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from\\nRome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn\\nstone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cn\\u00e6us Pompeius\\nMagnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its\\neffect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers\\nbetween the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.\\nWhich of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more\\nimpossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the\\noutline of the Glastonbury kitchen -- before its chimneys perished -- and\\nthereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of\\nthe camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several\\nother fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.\\nBut after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a\\nstarting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less\\nas a starting-point for\\n\\n ... the still glassy lake that sleeps\\n Beneath Aricia's trees.\\n\\nAricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to\\nthe level of the arx , to be approached by Albano by almost the only\\nwork on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct\\nof that \\\"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\\\" -- his votaries seem never quite to\\ndistinguish between him and Jupiter -- is really a work worthy of C\\u00e6sars\\nor consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments\\nof walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,\\nthe crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest\\nsurely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps\\nof prim\\u00e6val wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare\\nus for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;\\nwalls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,\\nand to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \\\"still glassy\\nlake\\\" to which the grove of the \\\"rex nemorensis\\\" has given the name of\\nNemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled\\nyears and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nIn these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for\\nventuring on an allusion which it might need a little research to take\\nin. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with\\nourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the\\nexplanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process\\nis a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to\\nspeak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat\\ngrotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better\\nknown as Caligula.\\n\\nThe ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,\\nand the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by\\nthe present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and\\nwho, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi\\nfrom close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among\\nthings, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow\\nof Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of\\nits height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so\\nwe go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we\\nfind the emissarius , so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done\\nits work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some\\none long before Camillus? The men who built the great cloaca of\\nRome were quite capable of cutting the hole through the rock of Alba,\\nwithout any message from Delphi or any design against the walls of\\nVeii. Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than\\nClaudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it\\nhas been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,\\nwe may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only\\nto keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp\\ntill we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy\\nof the name crater . We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side\\nby side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some\\ntime which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to\\nsay that it was long before the oldest prim\\u00e6val wall, the powers of\\nwater supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with\\nits narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable\\nto be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily\\ncome to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,\\ntaken to check it.\\n\\nBut when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house\\nwhich the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by\\nthe rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called\\nfields of Hannibal -- yet another crater, science tells us -- when we have\\nclimbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed\\nunderstand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than\\nwe did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over\\nthe battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Pr\\u00e6neste; it\\nmay range hither and thither over many points which have their charm\\nboth of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the\\nhistorical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will\\nbetter take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven\\nhills shrunk out of sight, a point -- rather a line -- in the Latin plain,\\nwith a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different\\nwas the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see\\nhow she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we\\nsee how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;\\nand we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look\\ndown too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the\\nvanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great\\nflat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.\\nHere, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where\\n\\n ... the Witch's Fortress\\n O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.\\n\\nAnd beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more\\ndistant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as\\na height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name\\nof Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,\\nnot only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights\\naround it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we\\nfeel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of\\nwide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a\\npower seated at Veii or at Pr\\u00e6neste. Rome, on her great river, with\\nher haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or\\nallies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the\\ngreat powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread\\nEtruscan pirates and Ph\\u0153nician traders; the Greek of Cum\\u00e6 might\\nperhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.\\nWe may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the\\nfall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that\\nare left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was\\nthat Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the\\ncamping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we\\nbelieve in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how\\nthings had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the\\nCarthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into\\nItaly by land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCori.\\n\\n\\nThere was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the\\nAcademy a little time back, that there must be something \\\"irritating to\\nthe Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often\\nadopted by English writers towards Italian history.\\\" \\\"Their cities,\\\"\\nhe said, \\\"which are still instinct with political and social life, are\\nregarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque\\nreminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\\\" Mr. Creighton was\\nspeaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he\\nsays may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where\\nthe political and social life at least hides itself from the passing\\ntourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as\\nnothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the\\ncity seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;\\nit is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after soldi \\nwhich nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid\\nof; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying\\nwhich the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree\\nmore advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less\\nfar back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once\\nindependent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,\\nand, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they\\nwere, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are\\nnow, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than\\ntheir successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty\\nof the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants -- far\\nkeener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the\\ncity awakens in his mind -- really does him no harm. The modern Latins\\nor Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of\\nthe country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the\\ncuriosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the\\nPrisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave\\nand discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when\\nhe knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is\\nsomething grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the\\nsight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the\\ncentre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;\\nnot exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not\\nill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.\\n\\nSomething of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at\\nleast, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right\\nwing of the Latin host of Regillus:\\n\\n Aricia, Cora, Norba,\\n Velitr\\u00e6, with the might\\n Of Setia and of Tusculum.\\n\\nTusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate\\npilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban\\nmount; \\\"Setia's purple vineyards\\\" it may be hard to take into the line\\nof march; but, with a slight change of order, \\\"Velitr\\u00e6, Cora, Norba,\\\"\\nwith the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,\\nwill form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have\\nmade it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that\\nthey have not cut into two. Velitr\\u00e6 -- hardly changed in the modern\\nVelletri -- has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest\\nbell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps\\nin, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps\\nout the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;\\nit stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter\\nneighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the\\necclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral\\nchurch placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom\\nof the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern\\npalaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman\\nremains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of medi\\u00e6val times. The\\nchief value of the town is as a starting-point -- we can hardly call it\\ncentre -- for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The\\nview from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,\\ndying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the\\nmighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all\\nthe height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its\\nfollowing of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like\\na great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean\\nDown and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes\\ntowards them by something more than their bright masses, something more\\nthan a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points\\nare crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned\\nstands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far\\nlower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some\\nway down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when\\nthe sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for\\nwhich Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for -- \\n\\n ... the gigantic watch-towers,\\n No work of earthly men,\\n Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook\\n The never-ending fen.\\n\\nWatch-towers, perhaps, in the strictest sense, we do not see, and we\\nshall hardly find them when we come nearer; but Cora, Cori , still\\nkeeps the mightiest of walls, which it was no wonder that men looked\\non as too mighty to be the work of such mortals -- in Homer's phrase -- as\\nwe now are, and looked on them as reared by no hands weaker than those\\nof the forgers of Jove's own thunderbolts. With Cori we enter on the\\nexamination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their\\nprim\\u00e6val walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the\\nwalls that are the most prim\\u00e6val of all. None of its fellows can show\\nsuch blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call\\nCyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside\\nwhat is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see\\nelsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together\\nas they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;\\nhuge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between\\nthem filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole\\nrange of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious\\nin such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,\\nRoman of Sulla's day, and -- the leap is a great one -- medi\\u00e6val walls\\nof the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin\\nking of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him\\nas sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first\\nfour -- we have already spoken of the first of all -- are all polygonal,\\nof distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.\\nThe rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the\\nbottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the\\n arx which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament\\nof Cori in quite another department.\\n\\nAccording to the nearly invariable rule, the arx of Cora contained\\na temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into\\na church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in\\nmany other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without\\ndamaging the portico of the house of Hercules -- the old Latin Herculus\\nwas hopelessly confused with the H\\u00earakl\\u00eas of Greek legend -- and still\\nkeeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;\\nkeeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his cella , the\\ninscription which records the work of the local duumvirs , Manlius\\nand Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They\\nprofess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they\\nstand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the\\nCapitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive\\nas P\\u00e6stum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,\\nthe upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,\\nand it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against\\nrule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns -- such as are\\nleft -- of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;\\nbut we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the\\npeculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not\\nspeak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise\\nagain after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?\\nStern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and\\nfavourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to\\nsome such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points\\nof view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.\\n\\nBut we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of\\nthis strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning\\nat a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss\\nof Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we\\nare tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few\\nfragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We\\nlight too on inscriptions. Besides the duumvirs -- one might call them\\nthe bailiffs -- of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the\\nfrieze of Hercules, another commemorates two Praitors ; surely these,\\nwith their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin\\nCommonwealth -- as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium -- dependent on\\nRome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the\\nchief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to\\nChristian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,\\nan altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's\\nhead, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.\\nOliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it\\nis a lovely cloister of that better kind of Renaissance which was in\\ntruth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials\\nof earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them\\nwith capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be\\nfound in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a\\nplace for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba\\ncannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the\\ntraveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him\\ntake his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than\\nsleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up\\nearly in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him\\nrather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorba.\\n\\n\\nWe will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers\\nhaving been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on\\ntheir way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,\\nskirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views\\nof the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea\\nbeyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when\\nthe traveller has found a firm foothold within \\\"Norba's ancient wall\\\"\\nthan while he has personal experience how\\n\\n The patient ass, up flinty paths,\\n Plods with his weary load.\\n\\nStill worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded\\ndown, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy\\nto persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness\\nof the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to\\nbe unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;\\nthe hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on\\nhis own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the\\nwall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the\\nass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed\\nwhen we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find\\nhow far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs\\nspring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will\\nbe almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in\\nkind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he\\ncannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.\\nFor within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for\\nthe crops are there, full and green -- \\\" segetes, ubi Norba fuit \\\" -- but\\nthe ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.\\nWe would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now\\ndoes ever since the people of Norba -- less wise, as the event showed,\\nthan their neighbours of Cora -- embraced the cause of Marius with such\\ndesperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather\\nthan let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.\\nThis inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in\\nat least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate\\ndictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great\\nsingle blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma\\nby its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has\\nperished only less utterly than Norba itself.\\n\\nCori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has\\nany fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.\\nCori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread\\ndown the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the\\nmountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a\\nsteep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves\\ndownwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.\\nBut we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so\\ncarefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various\\npoints on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers\\ndeemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the arx \\nrose on several terraces; its highest point -- crowned, we may believe,\\nas usual, by a temple -- must have formed a proud object indeed from the\\nvast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its\\nancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine\\nflat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori\\nrather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits\\non the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower\\nelevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples\\nof the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as\\nit is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,\\nwhich does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.\\nIt is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken\\nthe place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we see that Norma and Norba\\nby no means join one another; there is a gap between them which, while\\nwe are on the mountain, might pass for a valley. But as we look from\\nbelow, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,\\nand Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like\\na continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,\\nperhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within\\nwhich the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can\\ntake in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of\\nSermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the\\nwhole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points\\nwith which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from\\nthe height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and\\nnew proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable\\nmembers of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front\\nof the Circ\\u00e6an height -- a height so nearly cut off from the mainland\\nthat it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we\\nbetter understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days\\nwhen they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked\\nin what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of\\nmolehills by the yellow Tiber.\\n\\nAs the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by\\nthe walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill\\nstands distinct, the arx alone crowns the top, and where the town\\nwalls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts\\nitself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass\\nof the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the\\nrudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they\\nhave a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,\\nand it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone\\nhas been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of\\nthe weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the\\nfiner stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth\\ntheir while, do something more than this. They could, when they had\\nto make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of\\nexactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded\\noff, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at\\nthe greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign\\nof either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it\\nwould almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the\\nopening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung\\nbetween two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the\\nfirst builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which\\nmen began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great\\ninvention, is shown by a ruined building -- one of the few things within\\nthe wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building -- a little\\nway beyond the arx . Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for\\nthe roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea and New Grange,\\nnor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and\\nthe attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well\\nas from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,\\nmost unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call\\nthem, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange\\nproblem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have\\nalready hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,\\nlike that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as\\nwell come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.\\n\\nFrom prim\\u00e6val and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning\\nas we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only\\nmedi\\u00e6val, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is\\na house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least\\njust outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual\\ndwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have\\nonce been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which\\nstrikes us between the stern prim\\u00e6val wall of Norba, fencing in the\\nthick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied\\nand picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and\\nbuildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till\\na thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,\\nroofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of\\nruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of\\na dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played\\nits part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested\\nby its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to\\ndo with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed\\nelection. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,\\nled to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to\\nbe reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak\\nmight restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder\\nmen living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa\\nwithout greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is\\nsomething specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,\\nstanding so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look\\nof things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of\\nthe ruined medi\\u00e6val sites which often meet us in this region. It is\\nnot merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something\\nIrish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both\\nat Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in\\nIreland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,\\nthere is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might\\nhave been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of\\nthe houses reaching even into Renaissance times. The church of most\\npretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses\\nand the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness\\nof ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a\\ntown, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa\\nhas little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As\\nfor the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on\\nthe hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an\\nunrecorded age piled together to make Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegni.\\n\\n\\nThe visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history\\non the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite\\ncertain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take\\nwith him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there\\nmay be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a\\nhidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that\\nclass, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes\\nnothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they\\ndo not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A\\nnatural and important question is sure to present itself, and -- without\\nwings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome -- there is no immediate\\nmeans of answering it. Is the name of Signia -- now by a very slight\\nchange Segni -- to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of\\nLatium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry\\nthem all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in\\nwhich Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every\\nstep that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully\\nadmire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out\\nin each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his\\nquotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still\\nMacaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,\\nif he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian\\nand Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the\\nfact that \\\"Ferentinum of the rock,\\\" yet further on, has its place in\\nthem alongside of \\\"Gabia of the pool.\\\" He turns to his guide-book -- and\\nthe guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,\\nis almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only\\nthe entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with\\nthe remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.\\nAnd again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in\\nthe later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part -- Were the\\npeople of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic\\npavements? There is a kind of work called opus Signinum , a pattern\\nof black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at\\nPompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an\\nexample a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting\\nas the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin\\nLeague. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which\\nit will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had\\nat Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself\\na little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the\\nplace where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to\\nthe great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he\\nmay for the moment comfort himself by thinking that there are those who\\nmight be unkind enough to hint that he would still be equally uncertain\\nif he had a hundred quotations on the tip of his tongue, or if he were\\nin a library with thousands of volumes to turn to.\\n\\nBut whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not -- we may be\\nallowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \\\"a\\nSix-preacher\\\" -- there is no doubt as to its geographical position;\\nthere is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from\\nVelletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of \\u00c6quian\\nencampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the\\nVolscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between\\nthem and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark\\nmore than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by\\nus, in the low ground -- reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale -- the\\nwalls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful\\nheight and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves\\nhidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,\\nas we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its\\nmountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller\\ndetached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.\\n\\nSegni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the\\nsame class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but\\na table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on\\nthe mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it\\nwith Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the\\nimmediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the\\nsame as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano\\nhas more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of\\nbeing an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long\\nand narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the\\nspace within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The\\nspace within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded\\nwith dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one\\nquarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other\\ncases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the arx of\\nSignia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,\\nbut placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between\\nthe two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of\\nthe modern Signians; but under the name of Passegiata it does form\\npart of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the\\nother loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the\\ntraveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of\\nthe road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway\\nof Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the\\ngreat number of graceful fragments of medi\\u00e6val work to be found within\\nthe narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages\\ntoo poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing\\nbeauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from\\nentering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit\\nof the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the\\nright hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case\\noverwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen\\nfar away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the\\ngateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as\\nit were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing\\nwhich the prim\\u00e6val city has to show him.\\n\\nBut before he can reach either the Roman or the prim\\u00e6val gate he will\\nhave begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is\\nhardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great\\ndeal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.\\nThe huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note\\nperhaps two stages, yet often intermingled -- one, where the sides only \\nof the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where\\nthe outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \\\"rustication\\\" in\\nlate Renaissance work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a\\nstate of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the\\nshape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In\\na later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand\\nfree from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy\\nto say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how\\nmuch to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it\\nsomewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,\\nand a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.\\nBut it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of\\nthe hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the\\nwhole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required\\nit, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some\\ndistance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally\\nknown as Porta Saracenesca , leads from the outside world into the\\nouter enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close\\nto the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most\\nlikely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds\\nno small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of\\nthose instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of\\nthe principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search\\nof it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out\\nof stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they\\nwere striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting\\non two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as\\nthose of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle\\nof the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was\\nto place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately\\nunder the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of\\nthe lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain\\nvain striving after something different. As such, it is no small\\nlesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled\\ntogether to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us\\nback from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when\\nthe arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days\\nwhen men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of\\nconstructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are\\nmere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look\\nthan those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the\\nlintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever\\ntheir relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to\\ninnovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last\\ncrowned with success.\\n\\nIt is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can\\nunderstand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,\\nwhich has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called\\n arco Gotico ; it is harder to guess why the great prim\\u00e6val gate of\\nSegni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only\\nprim\\u00e6val gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been\\ncounted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of\\nthe enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall\\ncoincide. Hard by Porta Saracenesca itself is a small sally-port;\\nof the others, the larger ones, like Porta Saracenesca itself,\\nstand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same\\nstrivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the\\nground forbids the arx from reaching any great height above the rest\\nof the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular\\nlarge cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions\\nof different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.\\nHere is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive\\nconstruction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the cella in\\nRoman masonry, and the Roman wall of the cella is now carried up to\\nform a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,\\nbut it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes\\nwhich the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.\\n\\nLanded, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of\\nthe greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its\\nsatellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide\\navailable at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case\\nwe see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third\\nand greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of\\nSegni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the\\nCatholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.\\nPeter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.\\n\\nWe are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over\\nthe valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with\\ndouble force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,\\nbut still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and\\nhis lion-like reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIter ad Brundisium.\\n\\nI. Anagni.\\n\\n\\nHe who goes steadily from Rome to Brindisi, seeing what comes in his\\nway by the easiest manner of going, will not come very much oftener\\non the track of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is\\nthe haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he\\ncan along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will\\nof necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from\\nRome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.\\nBut the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and\\nits lesser fellow -- the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and\\ndry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child\\nAlbano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the\\ntemple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left -- all\\nthese seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So\\nmay the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre, -- the\\nhill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \\\"Norba's ancient wall,\\\" with\\nneither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it -- Ninfa's more modern\\nwall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,\\nruined churches, in abundance -- all these may be connected with an\\n iter ad Brundisium , but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let\\nour traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway -- we were\\ngoing to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could\\nwell be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his\\ntime-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni\\nand go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.\\nNot that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the\\ngates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It\\nwould most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,\\nprince of guidebook-makers, recommends the locanda there as \\\"reinlich\\nund eidlich,\\\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller\\nwill be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more\\ninclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is\\nno doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,\\nAnagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is\\nthe first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is\\nnot unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make\\nAnagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest\\nfor the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome\\nbut from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points\\nin some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he\\nwill be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,\\nalmost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is\\nas the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met\\nhis end, the prisoner -- not the last Pope who was fated so to be -- of\\na French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the\\nmind. In medi\\u00e6val history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to\\nthis day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress\\nmeaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.\\nAnagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore\\ndid not suffer at the hands of Renaissance Popes as Rome lived to\\nsuffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well\\ngo back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,\\nthen Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome\\nwhich neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and\\nPyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in\\nwhich Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation\\nof the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is\\nharder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading\\nOld-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few\\npersonal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or\\nOld-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical\\nor legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,\\nand the one great event in their political history; and those tell us\\na great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom\\nSpurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great\\nTriple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having\\nneither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,\\nthey hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.\\nBut their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust\\nin as they were between \\u00c6quians and Volscians, no alliance could\\nbe more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most\\nexposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself\\nwas the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle\\nmust have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must\\nhave looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants\\nof the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have\\nendured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening\\nneighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to\\nanother, we better understand the political relations of the endless\\nlittle communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The\\nally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need\\nto climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack\\nor deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them\\ntherefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare\\nand without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but\\nthey were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's\\nsight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at\\nAnagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either\\nat Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If\\nin some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less\\nclearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as\\nits symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one\\nanother could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.\\nThey must be always doing something to one another in the way either\\nof friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when\\nSpurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the\\nfirst Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land\\nand its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed\\nput a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.\\n\\nWe come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded\\nin by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni\\nand Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an\\nisolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,\\nthe city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the\\nhill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the\\nmiddle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief\\nstreet between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the\\nhill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,\\nthan can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,\\nallowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,\\nand a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must\\nconfess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well\\ntheir bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works\\nof the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the\\ndifference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious\\nforms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring\\nus back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by\\nordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord\\nMacaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there\\nwould have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \\\"no work of\\nearthly men,\\\" or as -- \\n\\n Reared by the hands of giants\\n For godlike kings of old.\\n\\nThe walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome\\nare wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to\\nput together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it\\nwas to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who\\nthoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use\\nit with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,\\nround the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they\\nare broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others\\nmerely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone\\nthrough all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the\\ncourse of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a\\nwhole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a\\ngood deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to\\ntheir nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.\\nIn some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by\\nfurther defences, buttresses rather than towers -- defences, by-the-way,\\nwhich must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later\\ntimes. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,\\ngreater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and\\nalways laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of\\nlarger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones\\nof two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a\\nlight-coloured stone exactly like the puff-stone of Gloucestershire,\\nthe material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings\\nin that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark\\nvolcanic peperino , which, towards the south-eastern part of the wall,\\nis used much more freely. The general effect, wherever the wall is at\\nall perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and\\ncolour.\\n\\nNow was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a\\ncertain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back\\nto our library; we take down the Dictionary of Geography ; we turn to\\nthe article \\\"Anagnia,\\\" and we find that by far the best contributor to\\nthe series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings\\nare damped when he says, \\\"The only remains extant there are of Roman\\ndate and of little interest.\\\" As to the \\\"little interest,\\\" we venture\\nto have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great\\nan extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an\\nobject of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the\\nlatest days which could come under the definition of \\\"Roman date.\\\"\\nBut what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of\\nthe Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us\\nto believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic\\nEmperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call\\nthe Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For\\nMarcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \\\" Flamen sume\\nsamentum .\\\" He did not know what \\\" samentum \\\" meant, and we cannot find\\nthe word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its\\nmeaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which\\nthe flamen put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want\\nto be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans\\nat some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they\\nhad no fellowship with the prim\\u00e6val works at Cori and at Segni; they\\ndid seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at\\nRome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the\\nwalls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from\\na Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were\\nburthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may\\ncarry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read\\nbetween four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,\\nwe shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the\\ndays of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have\\nlooked.\\n\\nOne thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the\\nbuilders of the cloaca at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders\\nof Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On\\nthe highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out\\ntowards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient arx , we may\\nstill see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised\\nby the arrangements of the medi\\u00e6val castle, the double gate of the\\nancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well\\nturned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same\\nworkmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the\\nbeginning. The arx itself, it should be remembered, had its separate\\nwall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the\\nsame character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street\\na little lower down.\\n\\nWhen we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character\\nin which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican\\nwalls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is\\nso far more famous as the city of medi\\u00e6val Popes that it is fitting\\nthat it should have something to show in that character also. The\\ntown is rich in medi\\u00e6val fragments. The main street, in its winding\\ncourses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,\\nwhich, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,\\nno small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with\\narches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one\\npapal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent\\nBishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for\\ntheir span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal\\npalace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,\\non its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France\\nor England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases\\noften present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the\\nmain street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches\\nresting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And\\nan elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender\\nshaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless\\nto add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these\\nrelics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured\\nand mutilated.\\n\\nIn the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good\\nfragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but\\nthe cathedral church within the arx is the only one which has the\\nleast claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on\\nthe edge of the hill with its east end -- that is, what would be east\\naccording to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west -- rising\\nup nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a\\nstately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on\\ntwo sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is\\nin a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the\\nchurch is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of\\nthe Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,\\nless satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains\\nthe vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many\\nother curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;\\nlet us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at\\nleast, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern\\nof the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the\\nmother-church of Rome and of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Ferentino.\\n\\n\\nItaly contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,\\nas England contains two places -- perhaps more -- bearing the several\\nnames of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,\\nRochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester\\nis also very conveniently written Rutchester , so the Etruscan\\nFerentinum is also conveniently written Ferentia . On an iter ad\\nBrundisium we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan\\nFerentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to\\nthe Itineraries, was to be found on the Via Latina between Anagnia\\nand Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name\\nof the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,\\nits ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is\\nHernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet\\nit is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the\\nendless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other\\ncompany that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest\\nremembrance of the name places \\\"Ferentinum of the rock\\\" among the\\nThirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot\\nwith the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the\\nrule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where -- \\n\\n ... in the centre thickest\\n Were ranged the shields of foes,\\n And from the centre loudest\\n The cry of battle rose.\\n\\nYet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to\\nfind a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican\\nhills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant\\ncomrades as Tibur and Pedum and \\\"Gabii of the pool.\\\" And, when we\\ncome back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more\\nand more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in\\nthat list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess -- among a\\nhundred other guesses -- at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next\\nbefore Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near\\nto our mark as Fortinei ; so we may hope for the best; but remembering\\nwhere Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes\\nare small.\\n\\nIn obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way\\nto Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take\\nin the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.\\nTill we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that\\nAnagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and\\nthe rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill\\nof Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that\\nthe spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \\\"Ferentinum\\nof the rock.\\\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many\\nother hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we\\nbegin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord\\nMacaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has\\nat least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the\\nrock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,\\nand sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.\\nAnd the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of\\nour series. They are still standing through the greater part of their\\nancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,\\ndiffering in material and construction. There is an original lower\\npart of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as\\nrude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which\\nthis earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,\\nbut it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later\\nrepairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction\\nof very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were\\nnot for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work\\nhas a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction\\nand material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work\\nby the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the\\narch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.\\nThe only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with\\nmerely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from\\nthe modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones\\nof the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient\\nentrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they\\nwere, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take\\na military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.\\nAnother gate, now known as Porta Maggiore , is a much more elaborate\\nwork, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is\\nplaced with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall\\nturns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great\\nadvantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows\\nwhether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult\\njust at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes\\nleast interesting. When we have to scramble -- all at least save Alpine\\nclimbers -- with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,\\nwe are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of\\nconstruction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to\\nrefer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no\\nsuch necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,\\nand the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed\\nat the same time. And at one point, not far from the Porta Maggiore ,\\nit will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long\\ninscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,\\nAulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part\\nat Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later\\nat Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of\\nhis day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty\\nbushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the\\nboys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the\\nwill of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity\\nCommissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get\\ntheir nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance -- yet\\nmany well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf -- will they\\ndevise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the\\nbenefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions\\nnearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the Times \\nwas filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in\\nSomerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once\\nstanding in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In\\none point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more\\nlucky. When Ferentinum had quatuorviri , they did not bury people in\\ntheir temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to\\npeople who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates\\nthe bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to\\nbe seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,\\nas a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his\\nbenefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated\\nby Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we\\ntrust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,\\nPopes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull\\ndown buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and\\nvillas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which\\nshould go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.\\n\\nWe have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we\\nwish -- we must confess the weakness -- to see independent Hernicans\\nwherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come\\nback and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum\\nspoken of, without any special emotion, as \\\"Roman.\\\" We look up\\nagain in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word\\ncertainly means something quite different from what it commonly\\nmeans in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light\\non anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us\\nto accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far\\nback as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think\\nthat the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old\\nCorinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great\\npiece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more\\nimportant -- though about the comparative importance some might raise a\\ndoubt -- than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them\\nby the proper road; we must get into what once was the arx , what\\nis now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,\\necclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly\\nthrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or\\nhouses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that\\nFerentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,\\nand several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed\\nat Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept\\nasunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the\\nsmall and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The\\nmost striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the\\nmass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the\\nbell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the arx , as a\\nmighty sub-structure. The walls of the arx show the same two dates\\nas the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude\\nstones of the first period; at another part they support the upper\\nrange of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to\\nHernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the\\n\\\"Roman\\\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of\\nthe censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius -- censors, that is, not\\nof Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first\\nvolume of the great Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , p. 238, and\\nits closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the Priscae\\nLatinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica . Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus\\nLollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known\\npersons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one\\nasks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got\\nhold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They\\nhad no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they\\nare written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the\\nRoman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have\\nbuilt what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside\\nonly mean that they built the later work on the top of the prim\\u00e6val\\nwall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an\\narchaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in\\nthe Tabularium of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row\\nof triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \\\"Cornelius Lucius Scipio\\nGnaivod patre prognatus.\\\" But we need not go back quite so far as his\\nday. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla\\nwill do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans\\nof Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.\\nFerentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns\\nwhich were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows\\nis most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,\\nrefused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather\\nto remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,\\nthe old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of\\nthe Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and\\nmagistrates -- Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them -- subject\\nonly to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars\\nof Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful\\nRomans.\\n\\nThis last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.\\n3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth\\nthe wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman pr\\u00e6tor suddenly\\nwished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for\\nherself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so\\nher husband bade the two qu\\u00e6stors of the town to be seized; one was\\nscourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the\\nwords of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which\\nRoman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities\\neven of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.\\n\\nIt is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the town as\\na municipium , while Livy also casually implies its possession of the\\nLatin franchise. Such obiter dicta do not go for very much. Scholars\\nsometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only\\ncasual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus\\nnot long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to\\naccuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the\\nWest of England. We here read of \\\"the county of the city of Bristol,\\\"\\nthe \\\"borough of Gloucester,\\\" the \\\"borough of Bath,\\\" and the \\\"borough of\\nTaunton.\\\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting\\nthat Bath is a \\\"city\\\" and Gloucester even a \\\"county of a city.\\\" May\\nwe not sometimes get wrong about municipia and Latin colonies from\\nthe same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a\\n municipium , but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,\\nwe once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the\\nelectors of a county to elect, not a \\\"knight of the shire,\\\" as they\\nhad done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called\\na \\\"member of Parliament.\\\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and\\neven Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,\\n curiae , and centuries, in ages long before their own day?\\n\\nThe walls then, though called \\\"Roman\\\" in a vague sense -- that is, it\\nwould seem, simply not prim\\u00e6val, like those of Cori and Segni -- are\\ndoubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was\\nstill a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most\\nlikely the walls over which the unlucky qu\\u00e6stor threw himself. The\\nwalls of the arx , where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,\\nconnect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the\\ninscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and\\nfrom the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral -- a\\nvery good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.\\nThe church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal\\ndamaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its\\nbell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A\\nlittle restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make\\nit into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,\\nunless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,\\nantiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little\\nminster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except\\nby comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if\\nthe church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime\\nof the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what\\nwe heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the\\ncrime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually\\nbegun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as\\nyet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse\\nto drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.\\n\\nThe church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen\\nthere in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant\\nvoice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the\\n arx -- buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account -- strange\\ntales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place\\neither in history or in received legend. Among other things he was\\nthrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a\\nvery pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one\\ndesigns to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,\\nit strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or\\nas we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other\\necclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city\\nof the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these\\nplaces; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which\\nhas an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people\\nwho chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome\\nlose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy\\nplaces of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and\\nanother creed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. Alatri.\\n\\n\\nThe tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with prim\\u00e6val walls, among\\nwhich we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at\\nAlatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly\\nclaim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest\\nplace, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is\\nthe one which has the least history. There is very little to say about\\nit, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but\\npreferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the\\nproffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained\\na distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least\\nthere can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich\\nin medi\\u00e6val antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich\\nin Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or\\nless Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri\\nnearly everything that we care about is strictly prim\\u00e6val. We cannot\\nreasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look\\nwere there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new\\nthen.\\n\\nAlatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in\\nall ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no\\nplace in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni\\nor Ferentino -- nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of\\ngoing and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked\\non as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without\\ncalling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are\\nnow following -- a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among\\nthem -- reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there\\nafter seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant\\njustice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed\\nit out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a\\nresting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of\\nAlatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from\\nits railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern\\nworld, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible\\nbell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to\\nAlatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for\\na while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what\\nthey saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the\\nAlatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of\\nthe walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the arx , are the most\\nprominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond\\nour immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited\\ntown. At Alatri indeed the prim\\u00e6val walls are so prominent that in the\\ndistant view no one would suspect them of being prim\\u00e6val walls at all.\\nThey are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what\\nmay be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still\\nfence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as\\nin so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal\\nprecinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and\\ncentral character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The arx \\nis not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the\\nwall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The arx \\nforms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point\\nof the compass on the mountains which keep watch around -- on the little\\ntowns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights -- on\\nthe houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill\\nwhich the arx crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a\\nchurch or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding\\nsite, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These\\nhill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;\\nat Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their\\nheights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper\\ncompanions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which\\nsurrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more\\nworthy building, either the prim\\u00e6val temple itself or some more fitting\\nsuccessor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs -- let\\nus say either the Parthen\\u00f4n of Athens or the Parthen\\u00f4n of Lincoln to\\ndo it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral\\nchurch of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the\\n cella of the prim\\u00e6val temple. Here we have something even more than\\ncan be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way\\nof a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are\\nconcerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church\\nwas actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house\\ngoing back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded\\nage which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There\\nis the terrace, there is the wall of the cella , wrought of the same\\nwonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding arx , as the walls\\nof the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the\\nordinary rites of Christian worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a\\nChristian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples\\nof a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them\\nwithin walls reared in honour of we know not what -- gods of unchronicled\\ndays, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed\\nas strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of\\nJupiter of the Capitol.\\n\\nWhere the pr\\u00e6historic temple has thus become the cathedral church, it\\nis not out of keeping that the wall of the pr\\u00e6historic arx should\\nbecome the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see\\nfrom afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly\\nfurnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can\\ndistinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air\\nof a wall even of Roman, even of medi\\u00e6val, antiquity. Shall we say it?\\nAs we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the arx of\\nAlatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We\\ncould not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular\\nand rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than\\nat Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls\\nin the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls\\nbuilt on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business\\ncommonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,\\nto strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have\\nlittle or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached\\nfrom within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this\\narrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a\\nwall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.\\nThe weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at\\nthis point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which\\nthe hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are\\nwhich are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in\\nthe walls of Alatri, whether of temple, arx , or city, do we find\\nanything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the\\nstones, of whatever shape -- and they are of many shapes -- have clearly\\nbeen cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though\\nthe system according to which they are laid is not the same in every\\npart of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of\\nconstructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be\\nseen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it\\nis hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor\\ndo we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where\\nwe should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The\\ngreat gateway of the arx at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its\\nbuilders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of\\nthe arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of\\nthe lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. We suppose\\nthat the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge\\nlintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals\\nwhom those of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea could not have despised. But, except in vastness\\nof construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly\\nplain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with\\nthe really artistic work of the Myk\\u00eanaian treasuries. It goes rather\\nwith the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri\\ncould carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the arx .\\nBut they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great\\ngate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of\\nthe vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the\\ncut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within\\nit, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the\\nsteep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.\\nEven the builders of prim\\u00e6val walls clearly drew a line between what\\nwas meant to meet the public eye and what was not.\\n\\nBut we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,\\nthe walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of\\nAlatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect\\nin the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be\\ntempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular\\norder by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these\\nlast, except that they do not supply anything like the prim\\u00e6val gate,\\nare just as well worthy of study as the walls of the arx itself. They\\nremain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and\\nthey are of the same general construction as the walls of the arx .\\nAt some points a singular contrast is made by medi\\u00e6val additions to\\nthe defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic\\nwindows of the time, stands out as projections from the prim\\u00e6val wall.\\nAnd, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in\\nthe way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the\\nwalls themselves. From the arx of Alatri we look down on several\\nbell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is\\nquite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point\\nof Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or\\nout of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided\\nshaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow\\nstreets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory\\nin every point save one. There should have been some decent building,\\npagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its arx , the noblest\\nin our whole range.\\n\\nWith Alatri we end one main stage of our iter , that of the\\nhill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in\\nthe world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if\\nwe had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of\\nwork. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant\\nand profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and\\nthe Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns\\nare very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in\\nwithout anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to\\nmention that the Locanda d'Italia , at Anagni, recommended in various\\nguide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a\\nnight at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless\\nand letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better\\nthan many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.\\nIndeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed\\nrace. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,\\nperhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make\\nthe best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need\\nbe; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or\\nhe might be a Hernican -- we cannot always be exact among these obsolete\\nnationalities -- \\\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. From Alatri to Capua.\\n\\n\\nWe have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not\\nbe hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling\\nin historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to\\nexisting remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the\\nspecial necessities of an iter ad Brundisium carry us to quite other\\nparts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest\\nare fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they\\nare wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their\\nlowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our\\nwork is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant\\ncompanions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their\\nsubstitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond\\nit. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can\\ncarry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway\\nsystem of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea\\nand the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,\\nbeyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters\\nto the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a\\nchance likeness between the names -- a name that ranges from the Euxine\\nto the Hudson -- without seeking in any sort to identify the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of\\nDionysios and the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of imperial Anna, it is still with a curious\\nfeeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before were\\nlooking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the wilder\\nmountains of Albania.\\n\\nSome of those who now looked across had already learned something of\\nthose heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new\\nfeeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look\\nout on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the\\nwestern world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped\\nthemselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the\\nAlbanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to\\nbeing to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to\\nthe East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the\\nboot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on\\nthe western side of the great backbone of Italy; we have still to catch\\nglimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on\\nthe bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of\\ncloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which\\ndecrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must\\ngo and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time\\nwe have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive\\nrange of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass\\nfrom the prim\\u00e6val cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of\\nsouth-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series\\nof churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but\\ntheir memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,\\nnot indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days\\nwhen Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of\\nHellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those\\neastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.\\n\\nGreek influence indeed begins -- some say that it historically began -- on\\nthe western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the\\npresent journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.\\nWe hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from\\nFrosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding\\nourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be\\npassed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious\\ndiscomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that\\nit is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized\\nquarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,\\nhowever, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a\\nfew miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts -- we\\nwill not talk of luxuries -- have fled from Capua and have found their\\nnew home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,\\n Santa Maria di vetere Capua , not the newer Capua on the site of\\nCasilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there\\nagain, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in\\nthe way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far\\nin advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to\\nLondon. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.\\nThe name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early medi\\u00e6val\\nCapua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the\\ntown now called Capua, but at the village -- it is hardly more -- of Santa\\nMaria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of\\nSamnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the\\ncity where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of\\nblood.\\n\\nOn our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or\\nnew. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder\\nCapua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has\\nbeen chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the\\nhistoric traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at\\neither, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small\\nvalue in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.\\nIt is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,\\nto look again on the amphitheatre of Capua -- Capua, the mistress of\\nRome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of\\namphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,\\neven of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with\\na general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan\\namphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they\\nhardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far\\nless perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than\\nat Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman\\nColiseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,\\nwhile of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how\\nmuch is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the medi\\u00e6val\\nbarons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than\\nat Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up\\nfrom underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.\\nIf any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is\\nnot a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that\\nthe inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation\\nand enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems\\nto imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at\\nleast, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It\\nillustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the\\ntaste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.\\n\\nBesides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes\\nand designs which line the road -- one of which is indeed singularly\\nlike a model of an amphitheatre -- the true Capua has little to show\\nbesides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,\\none which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid\\nthan Rome, so utterly gone -- or rather to see the little that is left of\\nit translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we\\nbegin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,\\nremained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the\\nlast remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.\\nAs such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the\\ncity itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may\\nbe sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city\\nby the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian\\nriver, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni\\nand Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than\\nFlorence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking\\nof the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the arx of\\nCapua could have stood, if we are to understand by an arx something\\nset upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to\\nlater ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The\\nSamnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,\\nhad become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of\\nthe mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.\\n\\n \\\"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\\\"\\n\\nsays the line which comes as such a relief after the involved\\nconstructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as\\nsimply worded as it could be in a medi\\u00e6val chronicle, which gives us\\na true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without\\na single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was\\ndoubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,\\nwho had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment\\nto the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was\\nlargely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the\\nlarge amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any\\nmeasure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua\\nfor a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the\\nRoman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who\\nfilled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once\\nmore a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came\\nnot as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,\\nand when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the\\nkeeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those\\nremnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the arx of Capua, are not\\nto be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his\\nfirst or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan\\n arx , he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their\\nlowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the\\nCampanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we\\ncome to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way\\nto a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan\\namphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of\\nTifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his\\ncamp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the\\nholy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain\\nwhich rises above its massy tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.\\n\\n\\nWe reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching\\nof Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of\\nbeleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout\\nfighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his\\nlast hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the\\ndanger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in\\nsome tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks\\nwhich doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no\\nlake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend\\non Tifata as grew round -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nYet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent\\nforth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest\\nforms into which any kind of Italian or Hellenic worship strayed\\nmight well seem mild. In tracking the career of Hannibal, we are ever\\ndisappointed at the utter lack of means to call up a picture of the\\nman himself apart from his public acts. He had human weaknesses, for\\nhe found a mistress at Salapia. He had his sallies of merriment, for\\nhe could raise a laugh at the grave Gisgo. But the course of his inner\\nlife is hidden from us. Still we can at least see that he was, in his\\nown belief, charged with a mission from the gods of his own city. And\\nit needs an effort to bear in mind that the gods of Hannibal were Baal\\nand Moloch. The goddess to whom he would have reared a temple would\\nhave been, not a Diana, but an Ashtoreth. Yet, among the many, and\\nmostly false, charges of cruelty brought against the great Ph\\u0153nician\\nby Roman writers, we do not hear, as we do in the case of some other\\nCarthaginian commanders, of captives being made to pass through the\\nfire to the gods of Carthage. Hannibal, the friend of Capua, would at\\nCapua honour Diana of Tifata; but it was not Diana that had sent him.\\nWith what thanks did he honour his own gods, when Capua, second city\\nof all Italy, welcomed the victor of Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cann\\u00e6? Is\\nit too bold a flight to fancy the mount of Tifata the scene of the same\\nform of Baal-worship as the mount of Carmel?\\n\\nBut the gods of Italy lived on, undisturbed by the momentary presence\\nof Semitic rivals. Diana was not the only power worshipped on Tifata;\\nJupiter also had his holy place. And it may be that the venerable\\nchurch which now forms the chief attraction of the hill-side represents\\nthe holy place of Jupiter rather than the holy place of Diana. It is\\ncurious to see how a kind of appropriateness was often sought after in\\nthe nomenclature of Pagan temples when turned into Christian churches.\\nThus, at Athens, the Parthen\\u00f4n remained the Parthen\\u00f4n, while the temple\\nof the warrior Th\\u00easeus or H\\u00earakl\\u00eas became the church of the warrior\\nGeorge. We should look for a Santa Maria or a Santa Lucia at\\nthe least, on the site of the sanctuary of Diana. Had we here a San\\nPietro , we should have very little doubt in setting down the prince\\nof the Apostles as having supplanted the father of gods and men. But\\nat Sant' Angelo in Formis we feel somewhat less certain; St. Michael\\nsuggests the Norman, and the Norman has been there. It may well be that\\nthe name is no older than his day.\\n\\nBut St. Michael on the slope of Tifata did carry us back in thought to\\na church of St. Peter seen some months before under a widely different\\nstate of outward things. We then made a somewhat difficult journey to a\\ngreat and solitary Tuscan basilica in time of snow. The outward aspect\\nof nature had certainly changed a good deal between the bleak day in\\nJanuary when it was found a hard task to follow the way from Pisa to\\nthe basilica of the prince of the Apostles in Grado and the sunny day\\nin May when the same travellers found their way without difficulties of\\nany kind to the basilica of the prince of the archangels in Formis .\\nAnd there certainly can be no likeness of position, even if both were\\nseen in January or both in May, between the basilica standing low in\\nthe flats by the mouth of Arno and the basilica which nestles against\\nthe mountains which form a wall to the rich plain of Vulturnus. But\\nin seeing any one of these great churches, left, not ruined, like\\nour Cistercian abbeys, but still living on a kind of life in places\\nforsaken or nearly so, something always brings up the memory of some\\nother of its fellows. Aquileia is perhaps the greatest case of all; but\\nAquileia, with its special position in the history of the world, stands\\nby itself. If Aquileia itself is dead, it has lived on a wonderful\\nafter-life in the shape of its Venetian colony. We go to see Aquileia,\\nbecause it is Aquileia; but even a well-informed traveller may know\\nnothing of San Pietro in Grado and Sant' Angelo in Formis , till\\neither his guide-book or some earlier visitor points them out to him\\nas places which he ought not to pass by. Aquileia again has other\\nthings to show besides the great basilica and its surroundings. St.\\nApollinaris in Classe is as nearly forsaken as a church that is still\\nkept up can be; but the basilica of Classis does not stand by itself;\\nit forms part of the wonders of Ravenna, as St. Paul without-the-Walls\\nforms part of the wonders of Rome. St. Peter in Grado might be looked\\non as standing in the same relation to Pisa; but it hardly enters\\ninto our general conception of Pisa, as the church of Classis -- papal\\nhavoc hinders us from adding the church of C\\u00e6sarea -- certainly enters\\ninto our general conception of Ravenna. S. Angelo in Formis at all\\nevents does not enter into our general conception of old Capua, because\\nthere is not enough of old Capua left to form any general conception\\nof it at all. The church and the small surrounding village do form\\na kind of distant arx to the greater collection of houses which\\nsurrounds the amphitheatre; but among the nearer objects which catch\\nthe eye from the height, the most prominent is not old Capua with its\\namphitheatre, but new Capua, Casilinum that once was, with its towers\\nand cupolas, medi\\u00e6val and modern. We look on many things from the\\nterrace in front of the portico of the archangel, but that which among\\nartificial objects chiefly draws the eye towards it, is not the elder\\nCapua of Hannibal and Marcellus, but the Capua which succeeded Aversa\\nas the seat of the elder but the less famous of the Norman powers in\\nSouthern Italy. As we mark the advance of national union, no less than\\nas we mark the advance of mere dynastic aggression, we have sometimes\\nto think, for a moment perhaps to mourn, that \\\"kingdoms have shrunk\\nto provinces,\\\" though in this form of advance and incorporation, we\\nhave no longer to add that \\\"chains clank over sceptred cities.\\\" Capua,\\non both its sites, once the head of an Etruscan, once of a Norman\\ndominion, passed, in one age, under the universal rule of Rome. In\\nanother age it again sank from its separate headship to become a member\\nof that greater Norman dominion in Apulia and Sicily which, after\\nmore shiftings, unions, divisions, transfers to distant rulers, than\\nany other part of Europe, has in our days been merged in the realm of\\nunited Italy, with Rome as its head, but not its mistress.\\n\\nWe reach then the height which, whether that of Jupiter or Diana of\\nold, is now the height of the warrior archangel. The whole history of\\nthe church belongs to the independent days of the second Capua; in its\\npresent shape it belongs to the days of independent Norman rule in the\\nsecond Capua. But the days of independent Norman rule were days when\\nthe arts of the earlier rulers of the land still lived on. We see signs\\nof the art of Byzantium, so long mistress of Southern Italy, and of\\nthe art of the Saracen, in Italy only a visitor or an invader, while in\\nSicily an abiding master. The portico in front of the church is Roman\\nin its general idea; but, instead of the colonnade and entablature\\nof the Laurentian basilica, we see an arcade whose pointed arches at\\nonce call up memories of Sicily. They have indeed little of Sicilian\\ngrace. Nowhere at Palermo or Monreale do we see such massive columns\\nbearing such massive stilts. Columns indeed we should hardly say, as\\nsome of them are plainly mere fragments. But here, just as in Sicily,\\njust as in Aquitaine, the pointed arch is no sign of coming Gothic;\\nthe style is still wholly Romanesque, and somewhat rude Romanesque\\ntoo. And in this region of Italy we can hardly doubt as to attributing\\nthe almost accidental shape of the arches to the influence of Saracen\\nmodels, perhaps to the workmanship of Saracen craftsmen. Hard by, but\\nnot joining the building, by an arrangement unlike Sicily, unlike\\nApulia, but the common rule of Northern Italy, rises a bell-tower,\\nor rather the beginning of a bell-tower, which raises our wonder as\\nto what it would have been if it had ever grown to its full height.\\nTwo stages only are finished, the lower of hewn stone, the upper of\\nbrick; but their bulk is so great that the tower, if it had ever been\\nfinished, would surely have ranked among the highest of its class,\\nutterly overpowering even the great basilica at its side, except so\\nfar as it would have been itself overpowered by the natural heights\\nabove it. As in some other cases, the thought suggests itself, were not\\nthose who left off building the tower wiser than those who began it?\\nThe tall bell-towers of Italy look well as they rise from the Lombard\\nplain, as they crown the hill of Fiesole, as they skirt the shores of\\nthe lake of Como. But we are not sure that a gigantic tower, which, if\\nit was to have any kind of proportion, ought to have been carried up\\nto a height as great as that of Venice, was in its right place when\\nset a little way up a mountain-side, as if simply to show how small\\nman's biggest works look in the midst of the works of nature. But the\\ntechnical eye is thankful for the fragment that has been built, though\\nmainly on a very technical ground. Professor Willis is gone, but his\\nhappy phrase of mid-wall shafts has not died with him. The custom\\nof the elder Romanesque towers, the abiding fashion of Germany and\\nNorthern Italy, was to set the little columns which divided the coupled\\nwindows in the very middle of the wall; the latter Norman fashion,\\nwhether in Normandy, in England, or in Apulia, was to set them nearly\\nflush with the outer wall. In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman\\nby allegiance, two sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman\\nfashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters\\nof detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious\\nthought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise\\nbetween two rival forms of taste.\\n\\nThe outside of this church, except so far as it forms an object in\\nthe general landscape, is perhaps chiefly attractive to the technical\\nobserver; the inside will surely appeal to every visitor, though the\\nvisitor who is technically informed in matters of painting may possibly\\nlook upon it with more of curiosity than of positive admiration. But\\nthe eye of the more general inquirer will give something like positive\\nadmiration to a basilica of eight arches, resting on ancient columns\\nof various marbles, with its original design far less damaged than is\\ncommon in Italian churches, and with every inch of available space\\ncovered with elaborate paintings of the date of the building. Like\\nSt. Peter by Pisa, the archangel by Capua trusted to painting for his\\nenrichment and not to mosaics; and though the Campanian pictures are by\\nfar the better preserved of the two, though nearly all the subjects can\\nbe made out with the greatest ease, yet Ravenna and Venice rise to the\\nmind to make us think that at least if endurance be the object, there\\nis a more excellent way.\\n\\nThe walls of this church form almost a pictorial Bible, with a few\\nlegendary and local subjects thrown in. The Abbot Desiderius, holding,\\nafter the usual symbolical fashion, the church in his hand, is to be\\nseen at the east end along with the archangels and evangelists. At\\nthe west end is what connoisseurs tell us is one of the very earliest\\npictures of the Last Judgment. On the two sides a crowd of scenes and\\nfigures from the Old and New Testament cover the whole space. The style\\nof the painting is said to show Greek workmanship; we look toward the\\nwest end and mark, hardly above the ground, a single small shaft with\\na capital of strictly Byzantine character. The ruling Norman seems on\\nthis spot to have pressed into his service the artistic powers of all\\nthe inhabitants of the peninsula. Italian, Greek, Saracen, all give\\ntheir help to adorn the house of the archangel. The Norman himself\\ncontributes nothing but the position of two small columns in the tower\\nwindows. We cannot even attribute to him the position of the house of\\nthe archangel, set Norman-fashion in a high place; for the first church\\nwas built before the Norman came. It is not so further east, where a\\ndistinctively Norman element is to be seen in the great churches of\\nApulia. But the gathering together of the best skill of the time from\\nall quarters is a thoroughly Norman function, whether in Italy or in\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe basilica should be compassed, so far at least as to climb the\\nhill a little way to look at its east end. Its surrounding buildings\\nsupply an arch or two to catch the eye on the way up or down. But the\\nessential features of Sant' Angelo are the grand display of painting\\nand the union of elements of so many kinds. It is the first of a great\\nseries of churches at which our course will bid us to stop here and\\nthere. But before we reach them we shall pass by one point where our\\nmusings will again be mainly secular and largely pagan. A short journey\\nwill lead us from Campania into Samnium, and the valiant men of the\\nSamnite land will claim a tribute on a spot which is Samnite beyond all\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. A Glimpse of Samnium.\\n\\n\\nFrom Caserta and what is to be seen from Caserta, our next journey lies\\nby the line of railway which runs right across Italy, connecting the\\ntwo great lines of the east and west of the peninsula. It leads us from\\nthe Campanian plain, with at least its sheltering wall of mountains,\\nwith Tifata to guard the great city that once was from the ruder land\\nbeyond, to the great plain of Apulia from which every feature of a\\nmountain-land has passed away. But, in so crossing from one side of\\nItaly to the other, we pass through a striking and an historic region.\\nWe are in the land of the mightiest Italian rivals of Rome, the land\\nof those with whom Rome had to fight, before Pyrrhos and Hannibal came,\\nand ages after Pyrrhos and Hannibal were gone.\\n\\nOur course leads us into the heart of the Samnite land, a land which\\nmay well call up endless musings on the hard fate of those \\\"hearts of\\nsteel\\\" who bore up so long against Rome, in the days when Rome was\\nreally at her greatest. And the memories of the same land in after\\ndays are not wholly alien to those of earlier times. Our course brings\\nus, at not a few points, across the memories, if not of nations, yet\\nof men, who had to bear up against the power of Rome, when the power\\nof Rome had taken a far other form than that of the senate and the\\narmies against which the Samnite had to strive. For the old Samnite\\nland holds its place in later story, as the land of princes who felt\\nwhat the spiritual Rome could do when the powers of the spiritual\\nRome were at their highest. We pass through regions which were the\\nscene of no small part of the history of the Norman and Swabian lords\\nof Sicily and Southern Italy. We are deep in the land of the counts,\\ndukes, kings, and emperors of the house of Hauteville and the house\\nof Hohenstaufen; and we are often called on to stop and track out\\ntheir deeds. At not a few points do we light on some building, some\\ninscription, which brings up the memory of Frederick, the Wonder of\\nthe World, and of Manfred, whose field of overthrow we shall presently\\npass by. In both periods the history of these lands has a character\\naltogether different from that of Northern and Central Italy. In the\\nlater period this needs no proof: we are dealing with the history of\\na kingdom, not with the history of a system of separate cities. But\\nsomething of the same difference extends to the earlier period also. If\\nwe wish to know more of Volscians and Hernicans, yet more keenly do we\\nwish to know more of Samnites. The part which they played is greater,\\nat all events in scale, and their dealings with Rome belong to a stage\\nof Roman history when we feel that we have a kind of right to know\\nmore than we could hope to know in the earlier time. But while we know\\nsomething of the character of the Samnite people as a whole, while we\\nknow something -- though much less than in some other Italian lands -- of\\nthe geography of the Samnite country, we have no clear notion of the\\npolitical position or the political action of any particular Samnite\\ncity or canton, such as we ever and anon do get of particular cities\\nof Etruria and Latium. And again, it is seldom that we can call up\\nany distinct personal conception of any Samnite leader as a living and\\nbreathing man. This is indeed a grievance which affects Samnites along\\nwith the other Italian enemies of Rome. The personal conceptions which\\nwe do get of Etruscans and Latins largely belong to legendary times. Of\\nhistorical Volscians we know very few. And we have already complained\\non Hernican ground that we cannot picture to ourselves the personal\\nlikeness of any single Hernican of independent Hernican days.\\n\\nStill, on this particular journey we have small right to complain;\\nfor we pass by the spot which calls up the memories of the most\\nmemorable Samnites of whom we have any personal knowledge. They are\\nmen of one name, most likely therefore of one house, and men of whom\\nwe emphatically wish to know more than we do know. Leaving Caserta\\nbehind, glancing at the Campanian plain and the Campanian mountains,\\nmarking Naples only by the smoke of the distant city, we pass along\\nthrough what, in our simplicity, we take to be the vale of Vulturnus,\\ntill we light on a more classical friend, armed with a more classical\\nmap, who explains that the stream which we are tracing is in strictness\\nnot Vulturnus himself, but only his tributary Calor. Anyhow we go\\nalong its course into the heart of the Samnite land, and we pass by\\none spot -- a spot which we ought to have treated better than merely to\\npass it by, a spot round which the greatest memories of Samnite history\\ngather, and where they strangely interweave themselves with wholly\\ndifferent memories of the history of our own land. We reach Telesia,\\nthe home of the Pontii, and we remember that Telesia was also for a\\nmoment the home of Anselm. Our guide-book provokingly fails us; but\\nthe large building on the hill-side must surely be the monastery where\\nhe sojourned. There are Roman antiquities in the place; for Samnite\\nantiquities we do not look. But did Samnites build no walls, or do the\\nmighty bulwarks of Cori and Segni mark an earlier state of things than\\nthe Sabellian occupation of Southern Italy? Anyhow, we are here at the\\nplace which has attached itself as a surname to the two most memorable\\nmen in the scanty personal history of Samnium. Here, on his own\\nground, we remember that Gaius Pontius who spared Rome's army at the\\nCaudine Forks, and who lived to be led, twenty-seven years later, as a\\nspectacle in a Roman triumph, to end his days, one might almost say as\\na martyr, by the axe of the headsman in a Roman dungeon. So we used to\\nread the tale in our youth; so moralized the historians of our youth\\nover the special baseness which handed over such a man to such an end.\\nOr are we to adopt the new reading of the tale which at least saves\\nQuintus Fabius Maximus from that special stain of blood-guiltiness\\nwhich cleaves to the canonized memory of Divus Julius? It may be\\nwell if we can believe that one of the worthiest heroes of the old\\ncommonwealth, if he could not forestall the magnanimity of Pompeius and\\nAurelian, at least did not sink to the special and petty spite of the\\nmurderer of Vercingetorix. We are now taught that the Gaius Pontius\\nwho appears twenty-seven years after the first mention of that name,\\nis most likely not the same man as the merciful victor of the Caudine\\nForks. If this be so, then Quintus Fabius, in consigning his Pontius\\nto the axe, merely conformed to the cruel custom of his nation, without\\nthe further aggravation of slaying in cold blood one who had dealt with\\nRome so nobly. And after all some might hint that the oldest Pontius\\nof all was the wisest. It may be that the sage old father of Gaius\\nknew human nature best, when he bade his son either to massacre the\\nwhole Roman army or else to let them go free without terms. It may be\\nthat the son chose a more dangerous path than either, when he took to\\ndiplomacy and middle courses.\\n\\nBut if the earlier Pontius of Telesia should prove -- though the guess\\nis a simple guess -- to be in truth two Pontii, perhaps a father and a\\nson, no doubt seems to have fixed itself on the identity of the last\\nPontius at the Colline gate of Rome. The rising again of Samnite life\\nat the last moment of all, when the war with the allies seemed to have\\nlost itself in the deeper whirlpool of the war of Marius and Sulla,\\nis really the most striking thing in the whole history, such as we\\nhave it, of the Samnite people. We are taken by surprise when, in\\ndays when Rome already seems the fully established head, not only of\\nItaly, but of all the Mediterranean world, her power, her very being,\\nis threatened by the leader of a nation which seemed to have been dead\\nand buried for some centuries. But, just like the Volumnian tomb in\\none way, so the Samnite resurrection in another way is a witness to\\nthe real life which the other states of Italy kept on under a form\\nof Roman dominion which made them externally dependent, which threw\\nits influence into the scale of oligarchy in their external affairs,\\nwhich ever and anon subjected them to some irregular demand, but which\\nleft the general course of their lives to be whatever they themselves\\nchose it to be. In the days of Marius and Sulla, Etruscans and Samnites\\nwere still Etruscans and Samnites; they had not become Romans, nor had\\nthey merged their being in any common name of Italians. The Social War\\nitself was the first attempt at forming a general Italian nationality.\\nBut the last campaign of the last Pontius shows how deep, in Samnite\\nhearts at least, was the earlier feeling, the feeling which knew\\nno greater whole than the federal union of Etruria or Samnium. It\\nshows too how specially deep was the feeling of hatred for the single\\ncity which had brought down so many cities and leagues to become its\\nhelpless dependents. Against Pontius at the Colline gate Rome fought\\nfor life, as she had never fought since the old days when she had to\\nguard herself against enemies who lived within sight of her capitol.\\nForeign invaders, Pyrrhos, Hannibal himself, did not come with the\\nsame fixed purpose of rooting up the wood which sheltered the wolves of\\nItaly. We can hardly doubt that it is the hand of Sulla which from that\\nday to this has hindered the south of Italy from being like the north.\\nBut the blow which crushed the Samnite people as the other nations of\\nItaly were not crushed, was vengeance taken for a moment when it once\\nmore became a question whether Rome should rule over Italy, whether\\nRome should exist at all.\\n\\nAt Telesia we look out, and muse on what might have been, if one\\nPontius had done otherwise than he did by the forks of Caudium, if\\nanother Pontius had fared otherwise than he fared at the gates of\\nRome herself. At our next halting-place we are called on, not to muse\\non what might have been, but on what was. At Beneventum we tread the\\nbattle-ground of Pyrrhos and Manfred, the ground of two of the greatest\\nvictories of the Rome of the earlier and the Rome of the later day.\\nThere we need not strive to call up the dim figures of men, like the\\nolder and the later Pontius, known by one action of their lives. The\\nEpeirot and the Swabian stand out as clearly discerned figures in the\\nhistory of their several ages. And the places where we next halt will\\nshow us the place of overthrow for both, the place of death and utter\\nruin for one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Benevento.\\n\\n\\nWe follow the stream of Calore till we reach a city which, without\\never having been one of the great cities of the world, without having\\nbeen even one of the greatest cities of Italy, has always kept up an\\nimportant historic being. Beneventum is a familiar name in all ages;\\nyet Beneventum has never been either a mighty commonwealth like Venice\\nor Genoa, or the head of a mighty kingdom like Naples and Palermo.\\nIt has had its princes; if we never heard of them before, we should\\nlearn a good deal of them by studying the monuments of their city.\\nThat is to say, the monuments will tell us a great deal about princes\\nnine hundred or a thousand years back; no monument that we remember in\\nBenevento tells us anything about the last prince who bore their title.\\nLet us suppose a wanderer who began his travels at Autun and who finds\\nhimself, in the course of the same wandering, at Benevento. He will\\nfeel it as a grotesque coincidence that, not so very long ago, a man\\nwas living who had once been Prince of Benevento and who before that\\nhad been Bishop of Autun. Benevento, among many other things that it\\nis, is also the later city of Talleyrand, as Autun is the earlier. But\\nthere is this difference that one thinks of Talleyrand at Autun and one\\ndoes not think of him at Benevento. At Autun he has his place, though\\na very strange place, in the long succession of Bishops of Autun; at\\nBenevento, though he bore the style of its prince, he stands all alone;\\nwe cannot find a niche for him in the succession of the Beneventan\\nprinces. Yet a prince of Benevento whose existence marks the ending\\nfor a season of the long papal dominion in Benevento reminds us that\\nBenevento had its princes before that papal dominion began. It reminds\\nus of the two distinctive features in the later history of the city.\\nBenevento was first the seat of Lombard princes who, placed on the\\nborders of both empires, contrived to escape all practical submission\\nto either; it was then the seat of an outlying scrap of papal dominion\\nsurrounded on all sides by the Sicilian realm. In both these characters\\nBenevento was a kind of curiosity on the historical map of Europe. But\\nthe city had its ups and downs before those days, and amongst other\\nthings it had gone through a somewhat grotesque change of name. It is\\nhard to believe that a city placed so far inland can really have been\\nof Greek origin; but legend attributed it to a Greek founder, and its\\noldest name had a Greek sound. Greek Maloeis , Samnite Maluentum ,\\nhad, when it was read into Latin Maloventum , an ill sound; so, when\\nthe Samnite stronghold was changed into the Roman colony, it took the\\nname of Beneventum, city of welcome.\\n\\nBeneventum, marked by Procopius as a strong city in a high place,\\nstands low as compared with the true hill-cities. Still, as compared\\nwith Capua, it might itself pass for a hill-city. It has just that\\namount of rise above the river which there commonly is where there is a\\nriver, such a rise as may be seen in many an English town which is not\\nas Durham or Lincoln. We miss the prim\\u00e6val walls of the hill-cities;\\nbut we find, on the other hand, works of Roman and medi\\u00e6val art such as\\nin the hill-cities we do not find. The arch of Trajan has vanished from\\nRome, except so far as it lives in the sculptures which were torn from\\nit to enrich the arch of Constantine. But at Benevento, as at Ancona,\\nthe memorial of the conqueror of Dacia still abides. The Beneventan\\narch may indeed fairly take its place in the Roman series. It belongs\\nessentially to the same class of designs as the arch of Severus and\\nthe arch of Constantine, while it has little in common with its own\\ntall and slender fellow at Ancona. At the same time, since it has, in\\ngeneral effect at least, taken upon itself something of the position\\nof a town-gate, since it bears the name of Porta aurea , to match the\\ngolden gate of Constantinople and the golden gate of Spalato, the arch\\nof Beneventum has now a somewhat greater air of reality than triumphal\\narches commonly have. The weak point of that class of structures\\nis that they are of no use. They do not, like a wall, a gateway, a\\nhouse, a temple, a hall of council, serve any purpose in the ordinary\\neconomy of things. They are purely monumental, set up to commemorate\\nsomething or somebody, but in no way to help on men's daily affairs,\\npublic or private. And yet they are not mere monuments, like a statue\\nor an inscribed stone. A large building of this kind, having very\\nmuch the air of a building which does serve some purpose, is a little\\ndeceptive. It is so like a real gateway that it calls up the thought\\nof a real gateway, and leaves us a little disappointed at finding that\\nthe building, after all, never was of any use to anybody, and was set\\nup simply to be looked at. There is, therefore, something a little\\nunsatisfactory in the whole class of triumphal arches, and it may even\\nbe that a slightly ludicrous element is thrown in when we find that the\\nimmediate occasion for rearing this record of the life and exploits\\nof the \\\"fortissimus princeps\\\" whom it commemorates was the repair of\\nthe Appian Way. But it does not become us to find fault with any built\\nand graven monument, specially with one of a time of which we have so\\nfew written monuments as the memorable reign of Trajan. We are so much\\nthe slaves of accidental associations, so apt to draw lines at some\\naltogether unreasonable point, that we may doubt whether the reign of\\nTrajan holds the place which it should hold in popular imagination.\\nSuetonius wrote the lives of Twelve C\\u00e6sars, and this mere accident has\\ncaused the notion of a break which has no real existence between the\\nSuetonian Twelve and those who next followed them. The reign of Trajan\\nmarks the Empire at its highest pitch of extent and power, at that\\nhighest pitch which, in its own nature, comes just before the beginning\\nof decay. His days saw, too, the highest pitch of architectural\\nmagnificence; and with Tacitus and Juvenal to adorn it, one might be\\ninclined to say that, as an age of Latin literature, the age of Trajan\\nmight hold its own against any earlier period of the Imperial rule. For\\nwe must remember that the great writers of the early days of Augustus\\nare in truth writers of the republican period living on into the\\nEmpire. The Flavian period, continued under Trajan, is quite as rich as\\nthe earlier days of the Empire itself. And we may notice that the arch\\nof Beneventum marks the reign of Trajan, and with it the Roman Empire,\\nat what was really its highest point. It was raised at a time when it\\ncould commemorate conquered Dacia and tributary Armenia. That Dacia and\\nArmenia could be brought within the range of that Roman world which is\\ncontinued in the system of modern Europe is proved by daily witnesses.\\nBut the arch of Beneventum was built too early to commemorate its\\nhero's later victories in the further East, momentary victories in\\nlands which neither Alexander nor Trajan could bring within the abiding\\nrange of Western influences.\\n\\nThe arch of Trajan is so distinctly the most famous thing in Benevento\\nthat it has carried us out of all chronological order. But the\\nhistorical interest of Beneventum lies earlier and later than Trajan's\\nday. In truth the Pax Romana forbade that the main interest of any\\nItalian city should lie in Trajan's day. We may believe or not as\\nwe please in the presence of Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas and \\u00c6neas; but Pyrrhos, Hanno,\\nTotilas, and Manfred are visitors who cannot be forgotten. The city\\nhas looked out on many battles, from the overthrow of the Molossian\\nto the overthrow of the Swabian. A pleasing tale in its history is\\nwhen that Tiberius Gracchus who is the first of a name to appear in\\nRoman history led back his victorious slave-soldiers to receive the\\nreward of freedom, and to be welcomed by the rejoicing people of the\\nfaithful colony. For among the Thirty Cities of those days, the Latin\\ncolony of Beneventum was not one of the laggard twelve, but one of\\nthe faithful eighteen that were ready to endure all hardships. In\\nlater warfare the city seems to have been less steadfast. It welcomed\\nBelisarius, and in after days Totilas took it without any trouble, and\\nif he destroyed the walls it was not out of revenge for any resistance\\non the part of its inhabitants, but for fear they should supply a post\\nof defence for an imperial army. But the greatest day of Beneventum as\\nan historical city comes later than Totilas and earlier than Manfred.\\nThe memory of that day may be studied in the chief remaining buildings\\nin the city, the two greatest churches and the castle. The west front\\nof the metropolitan church, a grand example of Italian Romanesque, is\\nfurthermore a perfect chronicle of local history. There we may read,\\nbuilt up into the wall, a crowd of monumental records of the Lombard\\nprinces of Beneventum, with their deeds, especially their dealings\\nwith the dangerous power of the Franks, set forth at length. The\\nbronze doors are famous, with their long array of Scriptural subjects\\nending in a lesson in the ecclesiastical geography of the province,\\nthe figures of the Archbishop of Beneventum and his suffragans. The\\nharmony of the front is a little marred by the single low and massive\\ncorner-tower; but the inscription sums up the history of Beneventum,\\npolitical and physical, for some ages. The city was laid waste by the\\nEmperor Frederick in 1229 and by an earthquake in 1688. The tower was\\nbuilt after the first overthrow in 1279; it was restored after the\\nsecond in 1690. Destruction wrought by the elements would thus seem\\nto be more easily repaired than destruction wrought by the hand of\\nC\\u00e6sar. But it is somewhat strange to find Frederick, in his own belief\\na successor of Trajan, a follower of Trajan in Eastern conquests,\\nbranded as a destroyer in the city where Trajan's memory is cherished.\\nBut Frederick had to deal with a kind of power which Trajan knew not.\\nThe wrath of the later Emperor fell on a city which was too faithful\\nto the Roman Bishop. The course of Trajan's rule was not likely to be\\ninterfered with either by the obscure chief of the persecuted Christian\\nsect, or by any minister of the creed of which Trajan was himself chief\\nPontiff.\\n\\nWithin the church the repairs done after the earthquake have wrought a\\ngood deal of mischief. But we can still see the four ranges of columns\\nof a mighty basilica which must once have taken its place among the\\nnoblest of its class. Their capitals are a little nondescript; but\\nthey do not offend the eye; if they were certified to be of Trajan's\\nday, it would doubtless be the right thing to admire them. The ambones\\nand the Easter-light are lovely work of the early fourteenth century,\\nthe days of a real Renaissance , truer than that which followed. The\\ntreasury is rich in vestments and other precious things; but the reader\\nof Anselm's Life looks in vain for that specially gorgeous vestment\\nwhich a Beneventan Archbishop of the eleventh century bore away from\\nCanterbury in exchange for the arm of St. Bartholomew, and which made\\nits wearer the most splendid object among the assembled fathers at\\nBari. If this missing garment carries our thoughts to England, the\\nround church of St. Sophia -- hexagonal in its inner range -- carries us\\nto the Eastern world, and reminds us that there was more than one line\\nof successors of Trajan, and that Beneventum came under the influences\\nof both. The cloister, with its amazing series of capitals, its birds,\\nits elephants, its hunting scenes, may rank with those of Aosta and of\\nArles, of which that of Aosta can supply camels to match the Beneventan\\nelephants. The castle dates only from Pope John the Twenty-second, far\\naway at Avignon; we look perhaps more carefully at the older fragments\\nbuilt up in its walls and on the lion in front of it. With the lion\\nin our thoughts we may look out for other beasts, graven or molten\\nor abiding in their own relics. Procopius saw there the tusks of the\\nKalydonian boar, as in later times he might, either at Warwick or at\\nBristol, have seen the ribs of the dun cow. It is for pal\\u00e6ontologists\\nto say what it was that the Beneventan antiquaries really showed\\nhim. Failing this natural wonder we go to pay our respects to another\\nbeast whose shape is due to man's device, in quite another part of the\\ncity. A rudely carved bovine animal, in which local patriotism sees\\nthe Samnite bull -- the bull which, on the coins of revived Samnium, so\\nproudly trampled down the Roman wolf -- is now cruelly to be ruled as\\nnothing better than a monument of intruding Apis-worship. We have less\\ntime to spend at Benevento than at some other cities; but the Roman\\narches and vaults of the strange building called Quaranta Santi ,\\nthe grand Roman bridge below, must not be forgotten, and we must still\\ngive one more thought to the two mighty men whose hopes were shattered\\nat Beneventum. Manfred fell with his faithful Saracens around him;\\nPyrrhos lived to fall by a meaner end at Argos; but Beneventum ended\\nthe real career of both. It is strange how the two were in some sort\\nthe converse of each other. Pyrrhos carried the Epeirot arms into\\nSicily and southern Italy; Manfred, lord of Sicily and southern Italy,\\nestablished a Sicilian dominion on the coast of Epeiros. Korkyra,\\nCorfu, the island which has seen every master except the Turk, formed\\npart of the dominions of both alike. We leave Benevento for another\\ncity in which the East and the West of Europe, and a crowd of other\\nelements besides, meet yet more closely than they do at Benevento.\\nAt Beneventum the eye of Horace began to be caught by the well-known\\nmountains of Apulia; Procopius somewhat boldly speaks of inland\\nBeneventum as being opposite to Dalmatia. The city which we take as\\nour next chief goal, if not strictly opposite to Dalmatia, is so marked\\nas being opposite to one Illyrian port as to have sent its name, so to\\nspeak, across the Hadriatic. We will not trouble ourselves to look out\\nfor Equotuticum, or to regale ourselves with either the bread or the\\nwater of Canusium. It is to the walls of Bari, fishy Bari, that we have\\nto make our way; at Bari, Greek, Latin, Saracen, even Englishman, are\\nall at home, and Bari is opposite to Antivari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Norman Buildings in Apulia.\\n\\n\\nAt Foggia the line of railway which crosses the Italian peninsula\\nfrom Naples eastward joins the great European line which for the most\\npart skirts the Western Hadriatic shore. From Rome itself the iter\\nad Brundisium is still made by way of Beneventum; for the great mass\\nof mankind Bologna has in this matter supplanted Beneventum and Rome\\ntoo. Our eastward course across the peninsula has done for us much the\\nsame as would be done by the like course across our own island. We have\\nundergone the same change as if we had passed from Wales, Devonshire,\\nor Cumberland, to Lincolnshire or East-Anglia. We need no longer\\nlook out for hill-cities, where the first element in such cities, the\\nhills themselves, is not to be found. At Foggia we have not even the\\namount of hill which we have at Benevento. We are in the great Apulian\\nplain, the plain so precious for sheep-feeding, and the occupation of\\nwhich has more than once given rise to wars and treaties. Of Foggia\\nitself many perhaps have never heard except as a railway junction.\\nYet Foggia has a history, and its history has monuments, though we\\ncan hardly put them on a level with the monuments and the history of\\nBeneventum. The capital of Apulia, the representative of ancient Arpi,\\nhas a history in some respects the same as that of Beneventum, in some\\nother respects its opposite. Both cities claimed Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas as a founder,\\nwhile Frederick the Second, a destroyer at Benevento, appears as a\\nlater founder at Foggia. One arch of his palace still remains, with an\\ninscription telling us how under him Foggia became a royal and Imperial\\nseat. There died his English Empress Isabel, on the splendour of whose\\npassage on her way to her marriage our own historians are eloquent.\\nFurther than this, the monumental attractions of Foggia hardly go\\nbeyond what is left of its chief church. Of its front Gsell-fels, gives\\na somewhat ideal engraving, showing it, not as it is, but as it was\\nbefore earthquakes and restorers after earthquakes had combined to mar\\nit. It was -- indeed, with all mutilations, it still is -- a fine front\\nof the later Italian Romanesque, with one of the rose or wheel windows\\nwhich we must now look for wherever we go. More attractive perhaps is\\nthe crypt, with its four columns and capitals of singular beauty. They\\nsurely belong to the time of the Imperial patron of Foggia, marking as\\nthey do a kind of earlier and more healthy Renaissance , which, taking\\nclassical form as its general models, took them only as general models,\\nand did not deem itself bound slavishly to copy every turn of a leaf\\nor every section of a moulding. Such works of the carver's tool are\\nakin to those noble coins of Frederick which seem ages in advance of\\nanything that bore the image and superscription of his grandfather.\\n\\nFoggia is however less likely to strike the traveller -- at least\\nthe traveller who comes from the hill-towns by way of Capua and\\nBenevento -- by any remarkable store of ancient monuments, than as\\nbeing the first to which he will come of a series of cities, most of\\nwhich at once impress the visitor by their air of modern progress and\\nprosperity. The heel of Italy, in its cities at least, certainly seems\\nto be the very opposite to a decaying region, or even to a region which\\nstands still. To be sure, the city whose name is the most familiar\\nof all is something of an exception; Brindisi, notwithstanding its\\ndealings with the whole world, is not as Bari or even as Trani. But\\nmost of the towns at which we tarry, or which we pass by, give quite a\\ndifferent impression. We cannot tarry at all. At Barletta we get only\\na glimpse of the Imperial colossus, and therefore we do not venture\\nto hazard a guess whether it is Heraclius or any later prince whom it\\nrepresents. Along this coast, any C\\u00e6sar of the East is in his place,\\nif only as a memorial of the long, though half forgotten, time when\\nSouthern Italy bowed to the New Rome and not to the Old. But we do\\nnot let these earlier memories wholly shut out the thought of the\\nlater combat when the Horatii and Curiatii of legend found themselves\\nmultiplied by a process exactly opposite to decimation. The attractions\\nof Trani are irresistible; a bell-tower rising as proudly over the\\nwaves as that of Spalato itself would force us to halt even if we knew\\nnothing before of what church and city has to show us. The metropolitan\\nchurch of Trani is certainly one of the very noblest examples of that\\nsingular mixture of Norman and more strictly Italian forms -- not without\\na touch both of the Greek and the Saracen -- which is the characteristic\\nstyle of this region, the natural result of its political history.\\nStrange, but striking in the extreme, is the effect of the east end\\nof this church rising close above the sea; far more truly admirable\\nis the effect of the inside, where the coupled columns of the Saracen\\nhave been boldly taught to act as the piers of the great arcades,\\nand to bear up above them a massive triforium, which by itself would\\nmake us think ourselves in Normandy or England. All the churches of\\nthis district have a good deal of their strength underground, and the\\nunder-church of Trani is worthy of the building which it supports.\\nThe smaller church, All Saints', a charming little basilica with a\\nportico of singular grace, as also several good pieces of domestic\\narchitecture, and the general effect of the tower skirted with its\\ndark arcades, all join to make Trani a place which cannot be passed\\nby, though no august form calls on us, as at Barletta, to tarry to\\npay C\\u00e6sar his due homage. But Trani has found something to be said for\\nitself both by pen and by pencil in quite other company. An accident of\\nlater times gave it a right to rank, like Brindisi itself, among the\\nSubject and Neighbour Lands of Venice. And Trani has peculiarities of\\nits own. The main features of the style may be studied elsewhere. We\\nlong to see Barletta, to tarry to pay C\\u00e6sar his due. We long to stop at\\nBisceglia and Molfetta, of which we read attractive notices; but again\\nwe must pick and choose, and Bitonto is the only place on which we can\\nqualify ourselves to speak at all at large, till we come to the head of\\nthe whole region at Bari.\\n\\nBitonto shares a station with San Spirito, but it lies further away\\nfrom the railway, and that on the inland side, than most of the towns\\nalong this line. Its main interest is found in its cathedral church,\\nwhich in some points prepares us for the buildings of Bari. First\\nof all in point of wonder, though latest in point of date, is the\\ntreatment which it has undergone at the hands of modern improvers.\\nA dim remembrance comes to us that we saw something of the same kind\\nin the Dominican church at Perugia; otherwise we ask in amazement why\\nany man should think it an improvement to cut off the whole upper part\\nof a church as seen inside by thrusting in a roof a great deal lower\\nthan the original one, and thereby leaving the upper stages outside\\nto stand up in the air, serving no kind of purpose. Yet this has been\\ndone both at Bitonto and at Bari. Yet perchance the improvers of modern\\ntimes might retort on the original architects, and ask why, when they\\nhad made three apses at the east end, they presently built up a wall\\nto hide them. This is the arrangement both at Bitonto and in the two\\ngreat churches of Bari. The notion of Normans working in Italy would\\nalmost seem to have been to make an Italian front at one end, and\\nsomething approaching to a Norman front at the other end. Thus the\\nchurch of Bitonto has an excellent west front of Italian outline, with\\ndetails more Italian than Norman, and with the characteristic round\\nwindow evidently designed from the beginning, though the one which is\\nactually there must be of later date. Also there either has been or has\\nbeen meant to be a portico over the lower stage of the west front, a\\nthoroughly Italian notion. But the east end takes almost the form of\\na Norman west front; a Norman founder, it would seem, was not happy\\nunless he could somewhere or other get two towers with an ornamental\\nwall between them. To this end the apses are sacrificed. Instead of\\nthe three curved projections which form the main features of so many\\nItalian, German, and indeed Norman, east ends, the whole east end is\\nflat. The side apses are disguised by towers, one only of which is\\ncarried up to any height, while the great apse is hidden by the wall\\nbetween the towers. Herein is the difference between Bitonto and Trani.\\nAt Trani there are no eastern towers, and the apses, though of amazing\\nexternal height and no less amazing slightness of projection, are still\\nreal apses with a real curve. At Bitonto no one could know from the\\noutside that there were any apses at all. As the ordinary ranges of\\narcades and windows are thus made impossible, the architect, like an\\nEnglish architect some generations later, threw his strength into a\\nsingle east window, and certainly made one as large and as rich as was\\npossible before the invention of tracery. An elaborate round-headed\\nopening is covered with rich devices, and has wonderful monsters to\\nbear up its side-shafts. This too is to be seen at Trani, and we shall\\ncome again to other examples at Bari. There is something very strange\\nin these attempts to reconcile the ideas of Normandy and of Italy in\\none building. But in these flat east ends the result is that we get\\nsomething which is certainly neither Italian nor Norman, and which can\\nhardly be approved according to any law of either reality or beauty.\\n\\nThe same spirit of compromise goes on in other parts. The endless\\ncolumns of the under-church supply a rich study of capitals, largely of\\nthe grotesque kind. Men, monkeys, the original ram's horn, leaves, the\\nImperial eagle -- better suited for the purpose than anything else -- all\\ndo duty as volutes. The columns in the upper-church too give another\\nrich collection of various kinds of human, animal, and vegetable forms.\\nBut here a soberer spirit reigns; though perhaps no one capital is\\nstrictly classical, yet the grotesque does not reign as it does below.\\nThree arches from columns, a solid block, three more arches from\\ncolumns, make up the nave. Over these Italian elements Norman taste\\nset a triforium; modern taste has hidden the clerestory. Outside, the\\nItalian has his way in the rich open arcades of the parapets and in\\nthe windows of various forms, filled, some of them, with that kind of\\npierced tracery which is neither Italian nor Norman, but distinctively\\nOriental, and which look as if they had come -- as they possibly may have\\ncome -- from a mosque.\\n\\nAltogether there is something singularly interesting in this mixture of\\nstyles -- more strictly this mixture of two varieties of the same style,\\nfor Italian and Norman Romanesque are after all members of one great\\nartistic family. Nothing of the kind happened in Sicily, where the\\nNorman kings simply set native craftsmen, Greek and Saracen, to build\\nfor them after their several native fashions. Here, in a land where\\nGreek and Latin elements were striving for mastery, where the Saracen\\nwas a mere occasional visitor, the Norman brought in the ideas of his\\nown land to make a new element. But, if nothing like this happened in\\nSicily, something a little like it did happen in England. There is no\\ndoubt that Norman architecture was influenced, though very slightly,\\nby the earlier native style of England, a rude imitation of Italian\\nmodels. That Norman architecture in Apulia should be far more deeply\\ninfluenced by the Italian models themselves was but carrying out the\\nsame general process, as was only natural, in a far greater degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Bari.\\n\\n\\nWe are now at Barium, Bari, the original Bari of the West, as\\ndistinguished from the Bari, Bar , Antibaris , Antivari , which\\nrepeats its name on the opposite coast. There we can now again, as we\\ncould have done seventy years back at Cattaro, land at a Montenegrin\\nhaven. The distinction between the two bearers of the name of Bari\\nimplies an association which is not out of place. The historic interest\\nof Bari gathers wholly round its connexion with the lands on the\\nother side of Hadria. In earlier days the place has really no history\\nwhatever. Its most memorable day was when the powers of the Eastern\\nand Western Empires -- powers which perhaps never again worked in such\\nharmony -- were needed to dislodge a Saracen Sultan from its walls.\\n\\\"Emir,\\\" some one will say, not \\\"Sultan,\\\" and certainly we are more\\nused in Europe to Sultans of much later date than the days of Lewis\\nthe Second and Basil the First, Sultans coming from quite other lands\\nthan any that can have sent forth the Mussulman prince of Bari. But\\nhe is called Sultan as well as Emir by his one biographer, the Emperor\\nConstantine, and we cannot appeal from those august pages which still\\nform the best guide-book to the eastern shores of the Hadriatic.\\nAnyhow, the Sultan of Bari was a philosopher; he never laughed, except\\nonce when he saw a wheel go round; for that reminded him of the ups and\\ndowns of his own fortunes. Then Bari passes to the rule of the Eastern\\nEmpire; instead of a Sultan it has a Katapan, representative of the\\nEastern Augustus in that Italian dominion which had become so small\\nat the beginning of the ninth century, and which was so great again at\\nits end. Threatened again at the beginning of the eleventh century by\\nnew Saracen invaders, it is guarded by the fleets of Venice, still the\\nfaithful vassal of Constantinople against a common enemy. Seventy years\\nlater the arms of Robert Wiscard added the capital of Byzantine Italy\\nto his Norman dominion, and before the century was out, Pope Urban, the\\ngreat stirrer of the West against the Mussulman East, chose Bari as the\\nscene of the Council called to denounce at once the practical abuses of\\nthe Christian West and the dogmatic errors of the Christian East. Once\\nmore, in the next age, we find Bari looking across the sea to its old\\nlord, and chastised by the Sicilian king for its disloyalty. Add that\\nBari, before all saints, still honours St. Nicolas of the Lykian Myra,\\nand keeps his relics sacred, we are told, from Turkish desecration\\nby the craft of merchants of her own city. Altogether Bari seems, at\\nleast in its history, as much Greek as Italian or Norman. It would seem\\nneither unnatural nor unpleasant if Greek were still the tongue of the\\nseafaring folk of Bari, much as a Norman in his own land often carries\\nan air about him which would make Danish seem a much more natural\\nspeech for him than French.\\n\\nBut the great buildings of Bari belong to that mixed Norman and\\nItalian style of which we have already seen something at Bitonto. The\\narchitectural attractions of the city are chiefly to be found in two\\ngreat churches and one smaller one. The castle, standing by the sea,\\nshould have its landward side walked round, and the walk will reveal\\nmuch of picturesque outline and a little of good detail. But it is\\nthe churches, above all the great abbey of St. Nicolas, which are the\\nglory of Bari. They all lie in the old town by the sea, the old town\\nof narrow and crooked streets, in which it does not much matter which\\nway you go; you are sure to come either to the castle or to one of the\\nchurches before very long. Very different are things in the new town,\\nwhich we may rejoice in as we look at it as a sign of Bari's abiding\\nor renewed prosperity, but which can raise no feelings of pleasure on\\nany other ground. Its streets, crossing each other at right angles, are\\nindeed carefully dedicated to the worthies of Bari; but, unless we can\\nalways remember which of several perhaps not very familiar worthies\\nwatches over each of several angles which are exactly alike, it is\\neasy to take a wrong turn and to put oneself under the care of Andrew\\nof Bari when we ought rather to be commending ourselves to Robert.\\nAnd under either protection we yearn in the wide straight streets\\nfor some physical shelter from the Apulian sun, and wonder why modern\\nRome, modern Athens, and modern Bari should have so much less common\\nsense than Bologna, Padua, and Corfu had in days long past. Still,\\namid this rectangular labyrinth the sea is a help on one side, while\\non another the tall tower of the metropolitan church of St. Sabinus\\nbeckons us into the older streets, whose narrowness and crookedness\\nat least supply shade. That tower, one of the tallest and stateliest\\nof Italy, we naturally assume to be a detached campanile, without a\\nfellow and standing apart from its confederate buildings, church and\\nbaptistery. So it doubtless would be in a purely Italian city; but\\nhere we are in the city where the Norman displaced the Greek. The\\ntwo great churches of Bari, like that of Bitonto, have their towers\\nwrought into the building in Norman fashion, and at the duomo the\\ngreat round baptistery is also merged in the same mass with the church\\nand its towers. Both of the great churches of Bari have east ends\\nof the same kind as that at Bitonto; the apses are swallowed up; the\\nplace where the great apse should be is marked by a single splendid\\nRomanesque window. The eastern towers of St. Nicolas have never been\\ncarried up; at St. Sabinus the southern one has perished, but the\\nnorthern one still soars in all its majesty, thoroughly Italian in its\\nconception, but rather to be called Norman in its detail. St. Nicolas\\nhas also another pair of unfinished towers at its west end, standing\\nat once beyond the aisles as at Wells and Rouen, and in front of them\\nas at Holyrood. They flank a grand Italian front which one would think\\nwould be finer without them. These western towers are absent in the\\nmetropolitan church; but that has a most perfect octagonal cupola\\nover the crossing, the grouping of which with the two lofty eastern\\ntowers, if there was any point from which it could really be seen,\\nmust have been wonderful. Thus, in both churches, something of a German\\noutline has either been consciously brought in or has been incidentally\\nstumbled on. The four towers of St. Nicolas, the octagon and eastern\\ntower of St. Sabinus, will easily find Rhenish fellows, though we\\nshould perhaps have to go as far as Angoul\\u00eame for a single tower of\\nequal majesty mourning over a vanished brother. In other points the\\nexternal arrangements of the two great churches of Bari have much\\nin common. The rose windows, the coupled windows, the blank arcades,\\nare much the same in both. So is the choice of animal forms for the\\nfanciful supports of columns. In most places the lion discharges that\\nfunction -- in a building designed by lions we should doubtless see\\nsomething different. So we do here at Bari, where the solid forms of\\nthe pachydermata are, perhaps discreetly, preferred to the lighter\\n carnivora . The elephant, we think, is to be found in both churches,\\nand the huge earth-shaking beast is represented so as to remind us both\\nof Pyrrhos and of Hannibal; some have the smaller ear of India, some\\nthe larger of Africa. The hippopotamus appears only in the west front\\nof St. Nicolas. Had the daring shipfolk who bore away the saint's bones\\nfrom Lykia made their way to the Nile also?\\n\\nWhen we pass the threshold of the two buildings we see that their fate\\nin modern times has been very different. St. Sabinus has suffered much\\nas Bitonto has suffered. The upper part of the building is hidden\\nin just the same fashion, and ugly tricks have been played with the\\ncolumns and their capitals. St. Nicolas, on the other hand, has been\\nleft comparatively alone. The chief changes which it has undergone\\nmust have taken place not very long after the original building. The\\noriginal plan was much the same as that of Bitonto -- three arches from\\ncolumns, a massive pier, then three more arches from columns. But this\\narrangement was disturbed at an early time by throwing three spanning\\narches across the nave. The effect is so striking that we can hardly\\nregret their presence; but it is perfectly easy to see that they are\\ninsertions, and, though they are essentially of the same style, yet\\nthey differ in their details from the original columns. These last all\\napproach more or less to the Corinthian type; in the under-church the\\npatterns are more varied. Here are still the wonder-working relics of\\nSt. Nicolas, and the balsam or \\\"manna\\\" which flows from them may still\\nbe drunk. In the duomo the under-church has been restored out of all\\nancient character, but it still keeps an ancient Byzantine picture.\\n\\nAs so often happens, the secondary church of Bari altogether surpassed\\nthe mother church in historic fame and local honour. To ourselves the\\nfact in its history which comes home most nearly is that it was here\\nthat Urban held his Council, here that Anselm, to the satisfaction\\nof all Western minds, refuted the creed of the East, here that he\\ninterceded with the Pontiff and the assembled fathers on behalf of the\\nking who had wronged him. Here too it was that the keen eye of English\\nEadmer spied out on the shoulders of the Archbishop of Beneventum the\\nsplendid cope which is no longer to be seen at Beneventum. Such little\\ntouches in those days often brought the ends of the world together\\nin a way to which, in our days of more general intercourse, nothing\\nanswers. When French was the polite language alike at Dunfermline and\\nat Jerusalem, when the Latin-speaking clerk was at home in any corner\\nof the West, when the few men of the West who had learned Greek spoke\\nit so that a Greek could understand them, when men passed to and fro\\nbetween the civil services of England and Sicily, communication between\\ndistant parts of Europe was in some ways easier than it is now. Bari,\\none of the chief places for setting out on crusades, must for a long\\ntime have been a thoroughly cosmopolitan city. We do feel that the ends\\nof the earth have combined to meet at Bari, when we find the place\\nof honour in the church of St. Nicolas at Bari held by a princess of\\nBari, who became Queen of the greatest Slavonic kingdom. Emblematic\\nfigures of Bari and Poland support the tomb of Queen Bona, and her\\nepitaph describes her husband Sigismund, the first of that name, as not\\nonly the mighty King of Poland, but Grand-Duke of Lithuania, Russia,\\nPrussia, Mazovia, and Samogitia. Yet we might have lighted on Slavonic\\nassociations earlier on the road. There is a strange record of a\\nBulgarian settlement in the parts of Beneventum; but that would take us\\nyet further afield: it was before Bulgarians became Slavonic. But what\\nare we to say to the Samnite Schiavia which sheltered Anselm?\\n\\nThe journey is done -- \\n\\n\\\"Brundisium long\\u00e6 finis cart\\u00e6que vi\\u00e6que.\\\"\\n\\nOtranto lies yet further; but Otranto, yet more notably than Bari,\\ncomes within the Venetian Notitia . So does Brundisium, city of the\\nstag's horn, of the haven so aptly called, if we only knew in what\\ntongue it is that Brentesium has that meaning. But we are tempted\\nto regret that Brindisi and not Otranto is the point for which Hadria\\nhas to be crossed. Brindisi has no moral claim. We cannot look thence,\\nas we can from Otranto, upon the mountains of still enslaved Epeiros;\\nno one is tempted even to dream that he looks on free Corfu or on the\\nlesser satellite that stands in front as its outpost.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"But if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Freeman\\nPublisher: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS\\nPlace of publication: New York / London\\nDate: 1893\\n\\nArezzo.\\n\\n\\nThe city of M\\u00e6cenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,\\nshows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There\\nis some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,\\nand, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief\\nbuildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be\\nbought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among\\nthem surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that\\nclear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with\\nnourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different\\nways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having\\nyet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if\\nthe city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the\\nfirst rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both\\nforms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of\\nPisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect\\nof the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim\\na day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from\\nFlorence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.\\n\\nArezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities\\nwhich sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,\\nlike Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.\\nIt has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which\\npresently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself\\nin the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have\\nto be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect\\nof the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we\\ninstinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as\\na whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs\\nsome of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem\\nto borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it\\nwere covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several\\nsmall hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all\\nsides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast\\nsnowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the\\ncharacter of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a\\ngood deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a\\ngeneral view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to\\nthe left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must\\nclimb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean\\nfortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has\\ngardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about\\nat large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in\\nthe general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line\\nof the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except\\nwhere they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;\\nsurely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this\\nobject. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly\\ntheir whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit\\nit is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest\\nin some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show\\nside. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern\\nrailway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually\\ndescending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the\\ninhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from\\nopen fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it\\nis with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral\\nand the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without\\ntaking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of\\nArezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give\\nus either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of\\nmedi\\u00e6val towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect\\nin Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription\\nwhich illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed\\nsovereign Cosmo appears as \\\"Duke of Florence and Siena.\\\" He had\\ninherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;\\nmeanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the\\nhigher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\n\\nIn the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one\\ndominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral\\nchurch, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the\\ntown, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the duomo \\nis the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant\\nfeature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises\\namong a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of\\nthem, the great campanile of St. Mary della Pieve , though the body\\nof its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to\\nthe cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not\\nungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest\\narchitectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show\\nitself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and\\nthe town-tower, and that hard by the duomo ; but they do not hold,\\neven comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows\\nin the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a\\ncity which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical\\ncharacter was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of\\nArezzo, keeps -- though not on its old site -- his splendid tomb in the\\n duomo , on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles\\nwhich he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown\\nat his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of\\nhouses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building\\nbesides the churches is the front of that called the Fraternit\\u00e0 dei\\nLaici , in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of\\nArretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,\\nbut so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,\\nit contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show\\nin many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are\\nthe huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other\\nvast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.\\nNaturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones\\nwere no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as\\nrelics of the G\\u00e6tulian beasts of Hannibal.\\n\\nSomething may be picked up here and there in the other churches of\\nArezzo; but it is Santa Maria della Pieve which is the real object\\nof study. The duomo is absolutely without outline; it is a single\\nbody with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.\\nBut its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than\\nis common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the\\nGerman hand to which tradition attributes the building. The church of\\n La Pieve is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.\\nIts four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been\\nfinished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;\\nthe west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor\\nits defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which\\nnothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at\\nLucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column\\ncapitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its\\nlowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.\\nThe arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so\\nthey are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium\\nshows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The\\narches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well\\nas those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of\\nprodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is\\nquite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;\\nthe arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The\\nsouth side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:\\nbut it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient\\nbuilding on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the\\nwest front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished\\nfrom Arezzo. The \\\"Tyrrhena regum progenies\\\" have here left but small\\ntraces behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCortona.\\n\\n\\nFrom Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height\\n\\n ... Cortona lifts to heaven\\n Her diadem of towers.\\n\\nIf the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the\\nwalls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,\\nsuggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their\\nrace, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not\\nwin victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer\\nseems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with\\nClitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The\\njourney is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we\\nmight well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione\\nFiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern\\nhill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers\\na hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione\\ndistinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height\\nwhich it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.\\nWe have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the\\nheight, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and\\nCorinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of\\nthe younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,\\nas at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has\\nnever come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has\\nbecome at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas\\nis forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of\\nthe ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a\\ncity like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \\\"diadem\\nof towers\\\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of\\ntowers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any\\naccount in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make\\nup an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,\\nthere is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well\\nforsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the\\nplain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city\\nitself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it\\nthat we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site\\nitself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world\\nthat there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main\\ninterest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased\\nthat everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and\\nthat the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the\\nEtruscan walls.\\n\\nIn truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that\\nCortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had\\nfound only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which\\nlater times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost\\namong the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been\\ngreat in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little\\naccount that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the\\nground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just\\nat that time came its short period of anything like importance among\\nthe cities of medi\\u00e6val Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth\\ncentury, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.\\nYet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though\\nwe can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a\\ncity, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the\\nyounger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional\\nvisitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;\\nanother persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the\\nancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona\\nis emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own\\ncompany.\\n\\nAs an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,\\nthrough the regular stages of Roman colony and medi\\u00e6val commonwealth,\\nCortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of\\nits being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing\\nthat can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and\\nmonasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some\\ncontain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps\\nmarks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that\\nits cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.\\nThe duomo stands about half-way up the height within the town, on\\na corner of the walls. Its elegant Renaissance interior has been\\nalready spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building\\nthe columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper\\ncity where we should have looked for the duomo is occupied by the\\nChurch of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over\\nher portal as \\\"p\\u0153nitens Margarita,\\\" marked off thereby alike from\\nthe virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal\\nbuildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio\\nmust be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly\\ncoated as it is with the arms of successive podestas . Of private\\npalaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not\\non its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.\\nFrom the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the\\nacropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.\\nThe Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins -- not an\\nusual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its\\nditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed\\nfabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which\\nthe visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local\\nimportunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points\\nof view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done\\nfirst of all -- that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing\\nthat makes Cortona what it is.\\n\\nThe process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in\\nsome measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.\\nHappily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in\\nby far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan\\nrampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no\\nsmall height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,\\nbut still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood\\nin the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is\\nreason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must\\nremember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the\\ndays of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman\\nworks. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the\\none remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might\\nalmost have stood at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. On the highest point, the hindermost\\npoint, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside\\nan inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,\\nthe Etruscan wall has largely given way to the medi\\u00e6val fortress whose\\npresent aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only\\nto leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an\\noutpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of\\nthe whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seemingh\\nto stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the\\nhistory of Cortona in stone and brick.\\n\\nFrom the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and\\nthe other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,\\nthe glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chim\\u00e6ra is the glory\\nof the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought\\nwith endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a\\nfemale head, which we might at first take for the work of Renaissance \\nhands, and in which those who are skilled in such matters profess to\\nrecognize the existing type of Cortonese beauty. The painting however\\ndates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps\\nher ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their\\nskulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her\\npresent people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features\\nwere copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living\\ncountenance of one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerugia.\\n\\n\\nThe hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of medi\\u00e6val Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmedi\\u00e6val and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch's \\\"Life of Timole\\u00f4n,\\\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr\\u00e6historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.\\n\\nThe difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the\\nabiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical\\ndifference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if\\nwe will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of\\nPerugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona\\nsits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but\\non a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several -- possibly\\nseven -- outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.\\nThe Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of\\na very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and\\noutlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is\\nonly in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain\\nthe present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that\\nwe can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly\\na hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,\\nwhile the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.\\nBut Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the\\nplain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it\\nhas happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona\\nis not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long\\nperiod of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all\\nthe way from its railway station to its municipal palace.\\n\\nAt Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws\\nto itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\\n\\nPerugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as\\nreceptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked\\non. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At\\nthe two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on\\nthe Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.\\nAngelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long\\nseries of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to\\nLudlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with\\nits beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one\\nof the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other\\nend, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble\\nranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building\\nat its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the duomo \\nitself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it\\nshows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and\\nits pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not\\nchurches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from\\nother things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one\\nclass alone -- Augusta Perusia itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Volumnian Tomb.\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern\\nFreemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the\\nouter world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have\\nread various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,\\nits constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us\\nthe fullest particulars: we have only to complain that the historical\\npart is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should\\nnot like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient\\nin the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty\\nany further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact\\nduties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we\\nshould answer, not \\\"Amen,\\\" but \\\"So mote it be.\\\" Still, what Freemasonry\\nis, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a\\nFreemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books\\nleave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to\\nknow everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can\\nknow a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom\\nwe seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as\\nto the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,\\nand belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their\\nbuildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they\\nlived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan\\nbooks; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless\\ninscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language\\nwas, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,\\nhalf-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as\\nthe mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here\\nand there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one\\ningenious man has read it all into good German and another into good\\nTurkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like\\na Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything\\nin three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light\\non a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For\\nsurely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead\\nletter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,\\nbut at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.\\n\\nIt is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments\\nof a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part\\nof the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the\\ncollections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if\\nwe are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or\\nshall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly\\nEtruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes\\nlargely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this\\nmust specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have\\nleft no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly\\nfair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like\\nthe Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But\\nsuppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have\\nin the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek\\nor Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral\\nelement would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly\\ndominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be\\nso distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.\\nTake a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does\\nnot of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference\\nto the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven\\non the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in\\nthe Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye\\nand the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than\\neven the chim\\u00e6ra, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various\\nsizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.\\nThe departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the\\nuninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance\\nto divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is\\ndesigned to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the\\n Lucumonissa -- if we may coin so medi\\u00e6val a form -- lies apart, sometimes\\nalong with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to\\nbring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious\\nrace than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.\\n\\nBut if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\\n\\nWe are not describing at length what may be found described at length\\nelsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures\\nwhich gives them a strange and special interest. This is their\\nstrangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but\\nso are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch\\nof Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo\\nreclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly medi\\u00e6val recumbent\\nfigure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,\\nsay in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures\\non the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give\\nus living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the\\nRasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient\\nworks which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.\\nAnd nowhere do the sculptures look fresher -- almost modern -- than when\\nseen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the\\nsepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi.\\n\\n\\nThere is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of\\nmischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite\\ndifferent from that which makes the place famous with the world in\\ngeneral. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious\\nerror. When so many members of Parliament showed a few years back,\\nand when the Times showed only a very little time back, that they\\nbelieved that the University of Oxford was founded by somebody -- Alfred\\nwill do as well as anybody else -- and that the city of Oxford somehow\\ngrew up around the University, it became, and it remains, a duty to\\nhistoric truth to point out the importance of Oxford, geographical and\\ntherefore political and military, for some ages before the University\\nwas heard of. When the Times thought that Oxford was left to the\\nscholars, because \\\"thanes and barons\\\" did not think it worth struggling\\nfor, the Times clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford\\nthen, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because\\nOxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,\\nflourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat\\nof councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;\\nin other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,\\nwhile the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly\\nworthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects\\nwhich are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible\\nthat some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the\\nchurch and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the\\nerror is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the\\ncity of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis\\nand his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and\\nworld-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully\\nworthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on\\nages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place\\nwell worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and\\nthough his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light\\nmatter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very\\nunlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before\\nhim and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace\\nof the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called\\n\\\"seraphica civitas,\\\" before one of its later churches came to rank with\\nthe patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early\\nmedi\\u00e6val city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still\\nexist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a\\nkind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The\\nsaint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could\\nhe have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,\\nand doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow\\nstream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral\\nchurch of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the\\nGreat Twin Brethren.\\n\\nAssisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless\\nvarieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which\\nwe have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on\\nwhich it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge\\nmountain. As at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea, while the akropolis is high enough, there is\\nsomething far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis\\nof Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of\\nshelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The duomo \\nstands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top\\nof the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is\\nno small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the\\nremains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond\\nit, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling\\nof man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost\\nmore needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not\\nonly for the medi\\u00e6val walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark\\nan outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow\\nvalley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at\\ntheir feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the\\nglimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only\\nless wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb\\nfrom the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but\\nthere the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes\\nall the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,\\ngives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure\\nto the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a\\ncity running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of\\nbell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general\\neffect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,\\ncrowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except\\nthe steep of the mountain itself.\\n\\nOf particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a\\nrestriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,\\nSaint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest\\ninterest is the temple in the forum -- now Piazza grande -- with its\\nCorinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on\\nthe other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned\\ninto a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple\\nof Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting\\npart of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at\\nAssisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple\\nmust have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper\\nones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,\\nwith the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on\\nthe Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those\\ncomments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient\\nJewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the\\nsynagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is\\nthe dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,\\nand the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates\\nand people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great\\ncollection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it\\ndown quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the\\ndedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number\\nof inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,\\nthere are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best\\nworth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and\\noculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of\\nthe Sexviri for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,\\nand left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly\\nbrought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his\\ncoachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are\\nset thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of\\nforeign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and\\non the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements\\nwere practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of\\nAssisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less\\ngood a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.\\n\\nThe temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most\\nmemorable things in Pr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things\\nbesides, both Roman and medi\\u00e6val. The lower church of Sta. Maria\\nMaggiore , close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been\\nthe original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German\\nlook, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into\\nthe mind that it is the cella of a temple with arches cut through\\nits walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local\\nfashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter\\nhard by. Besides, at Sta. Maria Maggiore there are the clear remains\\nof a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,\\nunderneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has\\nbeen sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth\\ncentury, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,\\nand it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the\\ncrypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,\\nand Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above\\nare scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier\\nremains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the\\nsurrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman chester \\nabide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is\\nmodern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the Via San Paolo \\nleading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above\\nground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many\\nmemorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in\\nclimbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while\\nboth Saint Francis and Saint Clara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpello.\\n\\n\\nThe Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many\\ngates its full description as \\\"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia\\nCostante,\\\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum\\nor as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most\\nlikely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in\\none of its churches. Somebody must come to see them, or their keepers\\nwould not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them\\ncovered, in hopes of earning a lira by uncovering them. May we make\\nthe confession that we became aware -- or, to speak more delicately,\\nthat we were reminded -- of the existence of the colony at once Julian\\nand Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German\\nguide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel\\nthoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,\\nyet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and\\nthat, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman\\nmonuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more\\nperfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the\\nwonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we\\nshould hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;\\nbut a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is\\nno one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but\\nthere are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some\\nimportance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the\\nplace, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as\\nSpello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less\\nuntouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.\\nWe except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the medi\\u00e6val\\nhouses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.\\nBut that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong\\nin some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at\\nSpello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to\\nseize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the\\nfinest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains\\nand ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,\\nand the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers\\nand cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The medi\\u00e6val walls and towers,\\nat all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not\\neasily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the\\nantiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in\\nmere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps\\na little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not\\ndisappointing.\\n\\nAt Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;\\neven in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one\\nhand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no duomo , nor is\\nthere any other church of much architectural importance. The best are\\ntwo small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each\\nside of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building\\nof a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group\\nlying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There\\nis a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;\\nby its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the\\namphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with\\nits marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre\\nis down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the\\npresent city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original\\nRoman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever\\nthe influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed\\nwith so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from\\nSpello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments\\nwhich are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the\\nbuilding is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of\\nits bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;\\nother fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when\\nwe reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it\\nis its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.\\n\\nAs we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia\\nConstans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which\\nbears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the\\nconsular gate is reached only through a medi\\u00e6val one, which bears, as\\nwe have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the\\nstranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:\\nfor Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty\\nof climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in\\ncontinuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been\\npatched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single\\nsimple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to\\nthe lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,\\nknown as Porta Veneris , must have been a far more elaborate design.\\nBut the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double\\nentrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet\\nthere is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal\\ntowers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,\\nhigher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch\\nhanging in the air. This is locally known as the arco di trionfo . Of\\nthe arco di Augusto within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of\\nMacrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman\\nremains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and\\nfragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them\\nout. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival\\nVerona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain\\nperverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what\\nhas been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the\\nend of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match\\nthe mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one\\njourney. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to\\nspend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must\\nhurry on to aurea Roma herself, even though we have to rush by many a\\ntown and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest\\nof all, by\\n\\n ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,\\n The fortress of Nequinum lowers\\n O'er the pale waves of Nar.\\n\\nMarry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,\\npresents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to\\nhave come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the\\nRoman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Qu\\u00e6stor Bacchus -- it\\nis taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot\\nhelp Latinizing the Questore Bacco -- puts out another set of placards\\nto forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among\\nour memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a\\nsecession; we might almost expect to see once more\\n\\n ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.\\n\\nBut those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede\\neven to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the Sala\\nDante .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeii.\\n\\n\\nThe student of what M. Amp\\u00e8re calls \\\"L'Histoire Romaine \\u00e0 Rome\\\" must\\ntake care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history\\nof Rome -- and the local history of Rome is no small part of the\\n\\u0153cumenical history -- is not fully understood unless we fully take in\\nthe history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.\\nWith Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and\\nher allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made\\npart of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And\\nfirst on the list may well come the city which was before all others\\nthe rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of\\ndestruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through\\na country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with\\nthe heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has\\nutterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left\\nwithin the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we\\nare close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by\\na rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,\\nan inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the\\nfirst great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'\\nsiege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the\\nHellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such\\nas are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of\\nliving things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria\\nnothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some\\nconvulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,\\nand tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a\\nrace with whom death counted for more than life.\\n\\nA sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand\\nsome points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival\\nof Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,\\nwe understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the\\nhatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked\\non the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange\\na greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the\\ngreat border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate\\nneighbours which could contend with her on equal terms. Elsewhere, in\\nher early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace\\nor war with whole confederations.\\n\\nThe happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky\\ngroup of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great\\nas all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what\\nclearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And\\nwhen the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the\\ncharacter of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,\\nit is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city\\nwhich had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the\\nstage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing\\nRome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome\\nwould be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near\\ntogether could not go on together. Two cities, very great according\\nto the standard of those times, considerable according even to a\\nmodern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and\\neverything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the\\nmodern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours\\non its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and\\ndinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt\\nall the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while\\nRome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of\\nher dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,\\nconfederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come\\nsooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.\\n\\nThe site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city\\nmade, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing\\nlike the \\\"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\\\" Veii is\\nnot a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,\\nyet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above\\nthe steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the\\nfateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a\\ntable-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an\\nadmirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by\\nthe walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid\\nout on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as\\nin so many cases, the arx , a peninsula within a peninsula, was the\\noriginal city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,\\nit would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii\\ntook a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual\\ngrowth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted\\nextent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a\\ncity which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not\\nspread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the\\noccupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed\\nan old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber\\nbelow their walls.\\n\\nIt is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and\\nextent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which\\ncan be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in\\nthe circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring -- the Ponte\\nSodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.\\nBesides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs\\nof a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after\\ntimes arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains\\nof the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.\\nThere is the Roman columbarium , within the Etruscan site; there\\nare the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There\\nis, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures\\nand inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian\\nsepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment\\nto see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the\\nunaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the\\narms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive\\nform and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no\\nwritten \\u00e6nigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by\\nmarking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage\\nby far than the roof of Rome's Tullianum or its fellow at Tusculum.\\nIn the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it\\nbelongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from\\nEtruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes\\nfrom the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman\\nhistory, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think\\nit. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know\\nthat, except the palpable remains of the Roman municipium , nothing\\ncan be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.\\nIn the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by\\nconquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early\\nstage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same\\ndate, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;\\nthe only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and\\nhalf-Hellenic Macedonia.\\n\\nWe turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how\\nutterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman\\nhistory. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,\\ninasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.\\nBut that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in\\nRome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has\\nstretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be -- all this\\nwe understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of\\nLivy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiden\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nFrom the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the arx of\\nFiden\\u00e6 as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel\\nGiubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence\\nof Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other\\nthings sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to\\nhave been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems\\ndesigned as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter\\nof fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan\\noutpost on Latin soil. Whether Fiden\\u00e6 was really such an outpost in the\\nstrict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion\\nof the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was\\na Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the\\nEtruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally\\nof Veii, that Fiden\\u00e6 made itself memorable. If we accept the received\\nstory, the war which brought about the ruin of Fiden\\u00e6 was caused\\nbecause its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,\\nperhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus\\ntook so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,\\nand the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus\\nformed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We\\nmay believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least\\nwere real, if the witness of Augustus C\\u00e6sar is to be believed.\\n\\nEach of the roads which lead out of Rome -- since the railway came,\\nthere is practically only one way which leads into Rome -- has its own\\nspecial interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to\\nthe Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in\\nits material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations\\nis perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian\\ngate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing\\nto itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall\\nof Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by\\nthe Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in\\nthe new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline\\ngate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of\\nRome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of\\ndefence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome\\nmarched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to\\nput down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after\\nthe slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those\\nwho did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.\\nBefore the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the\\ndominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.\\nAnd when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the\\nnew entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that\\nher political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral\\ndominion was stronger than ever. \\\"At midnight the Salarian gate was\\nsilently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous\\nsound of the Gothic trumpet.\\\" And if these gates were a centre of\\nfighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of\\nburying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs\\nhere and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but\\nthis quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials\\nwhich is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline gate was the\\nliving tomb of unchaste vestals; not far beyond the Salarian we come\\nto the Christian c\\u0153meterium Priscillae . We go on; we descend the\\nhill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the\\nalluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting\\nof the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might\\nseem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived\\nand gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken\\ndown and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those\\nof Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but\\nif we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must\\nhave been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly\\nnew when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come\\nto another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a medi\\u00e6val\\ntower; the medi\\u00e6val tower now proclaims itself as an \\\"osteria\\\"; but\\nwe feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now\\nfairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills\\nbeyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills\\nof Fiden\\u00e6 are before us. To the right lies the ground between the\\nSalarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his\\nmaster Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the\\nrailway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with\\nTiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between\\nhills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a\\nrange of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to\\nthe right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fiden\\u00e6, in the pass which\\ndivides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on\\nthe inland side.\\n\\nThe arx of Fiden\\u00e6, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,\\na height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer\\nto them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river\\nleaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that\\nside rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city\\ncould look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of\\nthe small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,\\nthe Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii\\nitself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the arx \\nof Fiden\\u00e6 and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.\\nInland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when\\nFiden\\u00e6 was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place\\nagainst the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the\\nrest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original\\n arx . We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its\\n cloaca , the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley\\nby the brook between the lower hill of Fiden\\u00e6 and the hill which lies\\nbetween Fiden\\u00e6 and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It\\nwas no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground\\nas the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand\\nwhy Rome on the first opportunity swept Fiden\\u00e6 utterly away, while the\\nexistence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.\\n\\nAs at Veii, so at Fiden\\u00e6, the traces of the living are gone -- yet more\\nutterly at Fiden\\u00e6 than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more\\nplentiful, though Fiden\\u00e6 has nothing to set against the painted tomb of\\nVeii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won\\nthe spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fiden\\u00e6 as a deserted place,\\nthe possession of a single man. Yet the potestas of Fiden\\u00e6 -- perhaps\\nits dictator -- may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered\\non in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntemn\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nIt is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography\\nthat its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal\\ncharms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that\\nit has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.\\nThe merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages\\nback. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of\\nall ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are\\nof one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no\\nmonuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it\\nwill be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to\\nthis kind of research. At Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6 the great merit is that\\nthere is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the\\nmore to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fiden\\u00e6\\nuntouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;\\nbut we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.\\nAnd no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 full of Roman\\nand medi\\u00e6val monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,\\nas they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But\\nwe turn from Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 to a city compared with which Veii and\\nFiden\\u00e6 might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,\\nan exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fiden\\u00e6. The\\nsites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside\\nthe sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much\\nnearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it\\ndoes not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,\\neven more truly than at Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6, say that the very ruins\\nhave perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished\\nyet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special\\nattraction of its own.\\n\\nWe took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemn\\u00e6 both from the road to the\\nWhite Hens and from the road to Fiden\\u00e6. As we before said, it ought\\nto be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things\\nare not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh\\nfrom the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the\\nMilvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the\\noldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,\\nto let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that\\nof Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when\\nthe bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic\\nenemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood\\nthe host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius\\nor of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,\\nand how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time\\nwe keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We\\nare therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite\\nanother part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,\\nwho is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.\\nOur present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with\\nBelisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome\\nwas, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We\\nwalk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with\\nthe eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the\\nEtruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,\\nboth come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,\\nthat it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary\\nstream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct\\nand hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie\\nof origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the\\nmost frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor\\nwere sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a\\ndenizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was\\nlike handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path\\nkeeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at\\nall, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a\\nrocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside\\nthe Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters\\nwhen Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.\\nBut, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on\\na site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient\\nsettlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells\\nof any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in\\nthe hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy\\nhill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern\\nside by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemn\\u00e6, a vanished\\ncity whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive\\nwords. Antemn\\u00e6 was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose\\ndaughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers\\ncalled Quenfang , what sociologists called exogamy , which secured\\nthat the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;\\nRome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of\\nnobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemn\\u00e6 is merged, in Rome. We\\nmay be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which\\ngive Antemn\\u00e6 a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to\\nbe that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the\\nsite was, as now, like Fiden\\u00e6, the possession of a single man.\\n\\nThe story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus\\nspares at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.\\nParted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern\\npoint, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at\\nthe very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the\\ndescriptive name Antemnae , the town before the rivers. Such a site\\nbelongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the\\nPalatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was\\nwhile it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive\\nname, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree\\nof progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from\\nthe oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without\\nthe Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like\\nRome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which\\nmust cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be\\nincorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.\\n\\nOf a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that\\nwe can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the\\nsite. Antemn\\u00e6 has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some\\nstones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to\\nbe part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise\\ngreen hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.\\nBut the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates\\nare as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those\\nof Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fiden\\u00e6 and its surroundings, on\\nthe old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge\\nof Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the\\nGaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and\\nsome of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly\\nthe whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's\\n\\\"turriger\\u00e6 Antemn\\u00e6.\\\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the\\ntowers thereof than we were at Veii and Fiden\\u00e6. At Antemn\\u00e6 the ruins\\nthemselves have perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOstia.\\n\\n\\nFrom the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight\\nremains which mark the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6, from the almost more\\ninstructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemn\\u00e6, we may\\nwell pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any\\nof them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because\\nit was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This\\nis the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an\\nearly stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what\\nRome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making\\nRome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to\\npossess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once\\nmarked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland\\ntowns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and\\nnothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven\\nof Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes\\nOstia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.\\nAnd the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to\\nsupport it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as\\nproving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period\\nwhich is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,\\nperiod. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal\\nAncus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that\\nthe events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep\\nourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition\\nthen calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is\\nthat whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,\\nand that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.\\n\\nThis at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities\\nof that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime\\nenterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.\\nCorinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain\\ncitadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth\\nstarted in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.\\nIt marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies\\nabsolutely in the sea -- Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on\\nher peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland\\nAthens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on\\nthe broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand\\nthe value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or\\nVeii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet\\nmore. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or\\neven Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful\\nfor her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There\\nwere inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no\\ninland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.\\nIndeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime\\nor otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had\\nno separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a\\ndistance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.\\n\\nOstia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is\\neminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of\\nthose fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He\\nhas changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a\\nlittle dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which\\nhave been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,\\nand they have brought to light much that is most interesting and\\ninstructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in\\nvain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon\\nas they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its\\npavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,\\nleads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end\\nis gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to\\nthe stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to\\nimitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his\\nsuccessor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside\\nthe mouth of the cloaca maxima ; make a strong wall of defence against\\nthe waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long\\nas the cloaca maxima itself.\\n\\nAnd what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small\\npart of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia\\nis becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a\\nsomewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first\\nwith the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment\\never happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery\\nof Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at\\nwidely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing\\nwhich is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there\\nor anywhere else -- namely, destruction by the Saracens in the fifth \\ncentury, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \\\"Handbook,\\\" but which was\\ncertainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored\\nby Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as\\nthe haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards\\novercame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for\\nit. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change\\nwhich it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour\\nof Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to\\nlive on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings\\nlater than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with\\ngraceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is\\nabundant evidence that all through the second century of our \\u00e6ra great\\narchitectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there\\nis the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so\\nproudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions\\nsupply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be\\ntoo much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which\\ncertainly suggests that of Arles.\\n\\nIn the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he\\ncomplains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course\\nof the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is\\neminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,\\nsome rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber\\nmakes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,\\nif Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of\\nwalls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,\\namong the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides\\nof a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,\\nbelonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were\\nclearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall\\nwas broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;\\nthey chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best\\nsuited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may\\nwell have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The\\nwall of Servius had ceased to serve any military purpose, and the wall\\nof Aurelian was not yet.\\n\\nThe history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain\\nattempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into Gregoriopolis ,\\nbelongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its\\ncastle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but\\nwith seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old\\nOstia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart custode , who defends\\nhimself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle\\nof Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the\\ncathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which\\nnothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;\\nthe staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among\\ncardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the\\nolder site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated\\nstate. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a\\nstreet dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses\\nitself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,\\nleaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.\\nAt Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is\\ndug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the\\nfar greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are\\ncontent; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and\\nMother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with\\nFather Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our\\nguide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,\\nset forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly\\nminded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alban Mount.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places\\nwhich bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie\\nso far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different\\nnations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of\\nconnexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has\\nsettled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must\\nnot forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell\\nin the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or\\nAlbany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic\\nwas lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,\\nshe spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that\\nshe might have answered with a tu quoque or something more; the\\nEnglishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.\\nBut have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with\\nthe Duke of Al v a -- for in his tongue \\\"non aliud est v i v ere quam\\n b i b ere\\\" -- or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is\\nsingular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of\\nRome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as\\nthose by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and\\nthose Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.\\nIt is \\u1fec\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1\\u1fd6\\u03bf\\u03b9 and \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af in both cases, without the change of jot or\\ntittle. In this case, at least, we believe that philologers would deny\\nthe slightest kindred between the names; but the casual identity is\\nthereby only made the more startling. A malicious critic might say\\nthat Anna's Romans were as unlike old Romans as her Albanians could be\\nunlike the men of Alba Longa. But her Romans did at least claim to be\\nRomans, sharers in the inheritance of the wolf and the eagle; while\\nher Albanians certainly laid no claims to any rights in the Alban sow\\nand her thirty pigs.\\n\\nRome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly\\nthat its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in\\nderivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount\\nkept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There\\nis the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely\\ninterwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road\\nby which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still\\nthe displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre\\nof the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the\\npillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of\\ncrowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes\\nhis eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she\\ndid in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as\\nfavourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood\\nof living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,\\naccording to one version of his story, his body -- or perhaps only his\\nhead -- found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the\\nAlexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had\\nso many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all Albana ,\\nthe Albanum of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long\\nterraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The\\nwalled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Pr\\u00e6torian\\ncamp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still\\nexists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still\\nkeeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,\\nseek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano\\nand Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.\\nIn both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in\\nthe neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between\\nthem, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample\\nruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato\\nstood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in\\nher day of overthrow.\\n\\nThe town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most\\nprominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from\\nRome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn\\nstone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cn\\u00e6us Pompeius\\nMagnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its\\neffect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers\\nbetween the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.\\nWhich of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more\\nimpossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the\\noutline of the Glastonbury kitchen -- before its chimneys perished -- and\\nthereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of\\nthe camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several\\nother fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.\\nBut after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a\\nstarting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less\\nas a starting-point for\\n\\n ... the still glassy lake that sleeps\\n Beneath Aricia's trees.\\n\\nAricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to\\nthe level of the arx , to be approached by Albano by almost the only\\nwork on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct\\nof that \\\"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\\\" -- his votaries seem never quite to\\ndistinguish between him and Jupiter -- is really a work worthy of C\\u00e6sars\\nor consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments\\nof walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,\\nthe crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest\\nsurely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps\\nof prim\\u00e6val wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare\\nus for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;\\nwalls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,\\nand to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \\\"still glassy\\nlake\\\" to which the grove of the \\\"rex nemorensis\\\" has given the name of\\nNemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled\\nyears and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nIn these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for\\nventuring on an allusion which it might need a little research to take\\nin. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with\\nourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the\\nexplanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process\\nis a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to\\nspeak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat\\ngrotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better\\nknown as Caligula.\\n\\nThe ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,\\nand the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by\\nthe present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and\\nwho, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi\\nfrom close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among\\nthings, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow\\nof Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of\\nits height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so\\nwe go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we\\nfind the emissarius , so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done\\nits work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some\\none long before Camillus? The men who built the great cloaca of\\nRome were quite capable of cutting the hole through the rock of Alba,\\nwithout any message from Delphi or any design against the walls of\\nVeii. Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than\\nClaudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it\\nhas been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,\\nwe may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only\\nto keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp\\ntill we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy\\nof the name crater . We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side\\nby side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some\\ntime which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to\\nsay that it was long before the oldest prim\\u00e6val wall, the powers of\\nwater supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with\\nits narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable\\nto be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily\\ncome to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,\\ntaken to check it.\\n\\nBut when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house\\nwhich the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by\\nthe rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called\\nfields of Hannibal -- yet another crater, science tells us -- when we have\\nclimbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed\\nunderstand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than\\nwe did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over\\nthe battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Pr\\u00e6neste; it\\nmay range hither and thither over many points which have their charm\\nboth of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the\\nhistorical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will\\nbetter take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven\\nhills shrunk out of sight, a point -- rather a line -- in the Latin plain,\\nwith a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different\\nwas the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see\\nhow she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we\\nsee how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;\\nand we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look\\ndown too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the\\nvanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great\\nflat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.\\nHere, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where\\n\\n ... the Witch's Fortress\\n O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.\\n\\nAnd beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more\\ndistant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as\\na height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name\\nof Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,\\nnot only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights\\naround it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we\\nfeel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of\\nwide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a\\npower seated at Veii or at Pr\\u00e6neste. Rome, on her great river, with\\nher haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or\\nallies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the\\ngreat powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread\\nEtruscan pirates and Ph\\u0153nician traders; the Greek of Cum\\u00e6 might\\nperhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.\\nWe may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the\\nfall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that\\nare left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was\\nthat Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the\\ncamping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we\\nbelieve in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how\\nthings had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the\\nCarthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into\\nItaly by land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCori.\\n\\n\\nThere was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the\\nAcademy a little time back, that there must be something \\\"irritating to\\nthe Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often\\nadopted by English writers towards Italian history.\\\" \\\"Their cities,\\\"\\nhe said, \\\"which are still instinct with political and social life, are\\nregarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque\\nreminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\\\" Mr. Creighton was\\nspeaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he\\nsays may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where\\nthe political and social life at least hides itself from the passing\\ntourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as\\nnothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the\\ncity seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;\\nit is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after soldi \\nwhich nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid\\nof; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying\\nwhich the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree\\nmore advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less\\nfar back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once\\nindependent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,\\nand, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they\\nwere, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are\\nnow, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than\\ntheir successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty\\nof the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants -- far\\nkeener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the\\ncity awakens in his mind -- really does him no harm. The modern Latins\\nor Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of\\nthe country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the\\ncuriosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the\\nPrisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave\\nand discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when\\nhe knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is\\nsomething grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the\\nsight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the\\ncentre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;\\nnot exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not\\nill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.\\n\\nSomething of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at\\nleast, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right\\nwing of the Latin host of Regillus:\\n\\n Aricia, Cora, Norba,\\n Velitr\\u00e6, with the might\\n Of Setia and of Tusculum.\\n\\nTusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate\\npilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban\\nmount; \\\"Setia's purple vineyards\\\" it may be hard to take into the line\\nof march; but, with a slight change of order, \\\"Velitr\\u00e6, Cora, Norba,\\\"\\nwith the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,\\nwill form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have\\nmade it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that\\nthey have not cut into two. Velitr\\u00e6 -- hardly changed in the modern\\nVelletri -- has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest\\nbell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps\\nin, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps\\nout the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;\\nit stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter\\nneighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the\\necclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral\\nchurch placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom\\nof the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern\\npalaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman\\nremains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of medi\\u00e6val times. The\\nchief value of the town is as a starting-point -- we can hardly call it\\ncentre -- for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The\\nview from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,\\ndying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the\\nmighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all\\nthe height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its\\nfollowing of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like\\na great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean\\nDown and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes\\ntowards them by something more than their bright masses, something more\\nthan a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points\\nare crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned\\nstands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far\\nlower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some\\nway down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when\\nthe sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for\\nwhich Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for -- \\n\\n ... the gigantic watch-towers,\\n No work of earthly men,\\n Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook\\n The never-ending fen.\\n\\nWatch-towers, perhaps, in the strictest sense, we do not see, and we\\nshall hardly find them when we come nearer; but Cora, Cori , still\\nkeeps the mightiest of walls, which it was no wonder that men looked\\non as too mighty to be the work of such mortals -- in Homer's phrase -- as\\nwe now are, and looked on them as reared by no hands weaker than those\\nof the forgers of Jove's own thunderbolts. With Cori we enter on the\\nexamination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their\\nprim\\u00e6val walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the\\nwalls that are the most prim\\u00e6val of all. None of its fellows can show\\nsuch blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call\\nCyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside\\nwhat is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see\\nelsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together\\nas they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;\\nhuge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between\\nthem filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole\\nrange of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious\\nin such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,\\nRoman of Sulla's day, and -- the leap is a great one -- medi\\u00e6val walls\\nof the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin\\nking of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him\\nas sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first\\nfour -- we have already spoken of the first of all -- are all polygonal,\\nof distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.\\nThe rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the\\nbottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the\\n arx which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament\\nof Cori in quite another department.\\n\\nAccording to the nearly invariable rule, the arx of Cora contained\\na temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into\\na church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in\\nmany other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without\\ndamaging the portico of the house of Hercules -- the old Latin Herculus\\nwas hopelessly confused with the H\\u00earakl\\u00eas of Greek legend -- and still\\nkeeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;\\nkeeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his cella , the\\ninscription which records the work of the local duumvirs , Manlius\\nand Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They\\nprofess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they\\nstand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the\\nCapitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive\\nas P\\u00e6stum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,\\nthe upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,\\nand it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against\\nrule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns -- such as are\\nleft -- of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;\\nbut we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the\\npeculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not\\nspeak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise\\nagain after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?\\nStern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and\\nfavourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to\\nsome such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points\\nof view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.\\n\\nBut we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of\\nthis strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning\\nat a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss\\nof Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we\\nare tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few\\nfragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We\\nlight too on inscriptions. Besides the duumvirs -- one might call them\\nthe bailiffs -- of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the\\nfrieze of Hercules, another commemorates two Praitors ; surely these,\\nwith their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin\\nCommonwealth -- as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium -- dependent on\\nRome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the\\nchief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to\\nChristian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,\\nan altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's\\nhead, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.\\nOliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it\\nis a lovely cloister of that better kind of Renaissance which was in\\ntruth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials\\nof earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them\\nwith capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be\\nfound in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a\\nplace for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba\\ncannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the\\ntraveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him\\ntake his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than\\nsleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up\\nearly in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him\\nrather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorba.\\n\\n\\nWe will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers\\nhaving been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on\\ntheir way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,\\nskirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views\\nof the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea\\nbeyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when\\nthe traveller has found a firm foothold within \\\"Norba's ancient wall\\\"\\nthan while he has personal experience how\\n\\n The patient ass, up flinty paths,\\n Plods with his weary load.\\n\\nStill worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded\\ndown, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy\\nto persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness\\nof the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to\\nbe unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;\\nthe hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on\\nhis own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the\\nwall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the\\nass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed\\nwhen we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find\\nhow far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs\\nspring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will\\nbe almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in\\nkind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he\\ncannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.\\nFor within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for\\nthe crops are there, full and green -- \\\" segetes, ubi Norba fuit \\\" -- but\\nthe ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.\\nWe would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now\\ndoes ever since the people of Norba -- less wise, as the event showed,\\nthan their neighbours of Cora -- embraced the cause of Marius with such\\ndesperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather\\nthan let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.\\nThis inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in\\nat least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate\\ndictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great\\nsingle blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma\\nby its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has\\nperished only less utterly than Norba itself.\\n\\nCori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has\\nany fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.\\nCori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread\\ndown the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the\\nmountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a\\nsteep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves\\ndownwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.\\nBut we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so\\ncarefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various\\npoints on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers\\ndeemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the arx \\nrose on several terraces; its highest point -- crowned, we may believe,\\nas usual, by a temple -- must have formed a proud object indeed from the\\nvast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its\\nancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine\\nflat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori\\nrather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits\\non the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower\\nelevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples\\nof the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as\\nit is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,\\nwhich does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.\\nIt is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken\\nthe place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we see that Norma and Norba\\nby no means join one another; there is a gap between them which, while\\nwe are on the mountain, might pass for a valley. But as we look from\\nbelow, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,\\nand Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like\\na continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,\\nperhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within\\nwhich the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can\\ntake in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of\\nSermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the\\nwhole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points\\nwith which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from\\nthe height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and\\nnew proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable\\nmembers of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front\\nof the Circ\\u00e6an height -- a height so nearly cut off from the mainland\\nthat it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we\\nbetter understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days\\nwhen they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked\\nin what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of\\nmolehills by the yellow Tiber.\\n\\nAs the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by\\nthe walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill\\nstands distinct, the arx alone crowns the top, and where the town\\nwalls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts\\nitself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass\\nof the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the\\nrudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they\\nhave a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,\\nand it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone\\nhas been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of\\nthe weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the\\nfiner stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth\\ntheir while, do something more than this. They could, when they had\\nto make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of\\nexactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded\\noff, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at\\nthe greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign\\nof either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it\\nwould almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the\\nopening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung\\nbetween two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the\\nfirst builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which\\nmen began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great\\ninvention, is shown by a ruined building -- one of the few things within\\nthe wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building -- a little\\nway beyond the arx . Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for\\nthe roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea and New Grange,\\nnor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and\\nthe attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well\\nas from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,\\nmost unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call\\nthem, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange\\nproblem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have\\nalready hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,\\nlike that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as\\nwell come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.\\n\\nFrom prim\\u00e6val and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning\\nas we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only\\nmedi\\u00e6val, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is\\na house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least\\njust outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual\\ndwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have\\nonce been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which\\nstrikes us between the stern prim\\u00e6val wall of Norba, fencing in the\\nthick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied\\nand picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and\\nbuildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till\\na thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,\\nroofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of\\nruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of\\na dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played\\nits part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested\\nby its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to\\ndo with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed\\nelection. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,\\nled to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to\\nbe reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak\\nmight restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder\\nmen living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa\\nwithout greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is\\nsomething specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,\\nstanding so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look\\nof things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of\\nthe ruined medi\\u00e6val sites which often meet us in this region. It is\\nnot merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something\\nIrish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both\\nat Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in\\nIreland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,\\nthere is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might\\nhave been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of\\nthe houses reaching even into Renaissance times. The church of most\\npretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses\\nand the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness\\nof ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a\\ntown, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa\\nhas little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As\\nfor the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on\\nthe hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an\\nunrecorded age piled together to make Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegni.\\n\\n\\nThe visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history\\non the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite\\ncertain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take\\nwith him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there\\nmay be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a\\nhidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that\\nclass, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes\\nnothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they\\ndo not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A\\nnatural and important question is sure to present itself, and -- without\\nwings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome -- there is no immediate\\nmeans of answering it. Is the name of Signia -- now by a very slight\\nchange Segni -- to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of\\nLatium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry\\nthem all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in\\nwhich Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every\\nstep that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully\\nadmire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out\\nin each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his\\nquotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still\\nMacaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,\\nif he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian\\nand Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the\\nfact that \\\"Ferentinum of the rock,\\\" yet further on, has its place in\\nthem alongside of \\\"Gabia of the pool.\\\" He turns to his guide-book -- and\\nthe guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,\\nis almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only\\nthe entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with\\nthe remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.\\nAnd again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in\\nthe later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part -- Were the\\npeople of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic\\npavements? There is a kind of work called opus Signinum , a pattern\\nof black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at\\nPompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an\\nexample a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting\\nas the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin\\nLeague. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which\\nit will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had\\nat Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself\\na little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the\\nplace where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to\\nthe great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he\\nmay for the moment comfort himself by thinking that there are those who\\nmight be unkind enough to hint that he would still be equally uncertain\\nif he had a hundred quotations on the tip of his tongue, or if he were\\nin a library with thousands of volumes to turn to.\\n\\nBut whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not -- we may be\\nallowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \\\"a\\nSix-preacher\\\" -- there is no doubt as to its geographical position;\\nthere is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from\\nVelletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of \\u00c6quian\\nencampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the\\nVolscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between\\nthem and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark\\nmore than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by\\nus, in the low ground -- reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale -- the\\nwalls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful\\nheight and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves\\nhidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,\\nas we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its\\nmountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller\\ndetached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.\\n\\nSegni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the\\nsame class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but\\na table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on\\nthe mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it\\nwith Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the\\nimmediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the\\nsame as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano\\nhas more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of\\nbeing an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long\\nand narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the\\nspace within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The\\nspace within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded\\nwith dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one\\nquarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other\\ncases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the arx of\\nSignia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,\\nbut placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between\\nthe two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of\\nthe modern Signians; but under the name of Passegiata it does form\\npart of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the\\nother loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the\\ntraveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of\\nthe road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway\\nof Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the\\ngreat number of graceful fragments of medi\\u00e6val work to be found within\\nthe narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages\\ntoo poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing\\nbeauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from\\nentering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit\\nof the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the\\nright hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case\\noverwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen\\nfar away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the\\ngateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as\\nit were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing\\nwhich the prim\\u00e6val city has to show him.\\n\\nBut before he can reach either the Roman or the prim\\u00e6val gate he will\\nhave begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is\\nhardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great\\ndeal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.\\nThe huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note\\nperhaps two stages, yet often intermingled -- one, where the sides only \\nof the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where\\nthe outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \\\"rustication\\\" in\\nlate Renaissance work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a\\nstate of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the\\nshape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In\\na later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand\\nfree from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy\\nto say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how\\nmuch to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it\\nsomewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,\\nand a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.\\nBut it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of\\nthe hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the\\nwhole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required\\nit, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some\\ndistance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally\\nknown as Porta Saracenesca , leads from the outside world into the\\nouter enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close\\nto the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most\\nlikely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds\\nno small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of\\nthose instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of\\nthe principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search\\nof it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out\\nof stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they\\nwere striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting\\non two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as\\nthose of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle\\nof the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was\\nto place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately\\nunder the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of\\nthe lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain\\nvain striving after something different. As such, it is no small\\nlesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled\\ntogether to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us\\nback from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when\\nthe arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days\\nwhen men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of\\nconstructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are\\nmere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look\\nthan those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the\\nlintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever\\ntheir relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to\\ninnovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last\\ncrowned with success.\\n\\nIt is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can\\nunderstand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,\\nwhich has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called\\n arco Gotico ; it is harder to guess why the great prim\\u00e6val gate of\\nSegni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only\\nprim\\u00e6val gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been\\ncounted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of\\nthe enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall\\ncoincide. Hard by Porta Saracenesca itself is a small sally-port;\\nof the others, the larger ones, like Porta Saracenesca itself,\\nstand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same\\nstrivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the\\nground forbids the arx from reaching any great height above the rest\\nof the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular\\nlarge cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions\\nof different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.\\nHere is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive\\nconstruction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the cella in\\nRoman masonry, and the Roman wall of the cella is now carried up to\\nform a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,\\nbut it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes\\nwhich the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.\\n\\nLanded, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of\\nthe greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its\\nsatellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide\\navailable at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case\\nwe see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third\\nand greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of\\nSegni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the\\nCatholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.\\nPeter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.\\n\\nWe are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over\\nthe valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with\\ndouble force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,\\nbut still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and\\nhis lion-like reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIter ad Brundisium.\\n\\nI. Anagni.\\n\\n\\nHe who goes steadily from Rome to Brindisi, seeing what comes in his\\nway by the easiest manner of going, will not come very much oftener\\non the track of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is\\nthe haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he\\ncan along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will\\nof necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from\\nRome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.\\nBut the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and\\nits lesser fellow -- the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and\\ndry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child\\nAlbano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the\\ntemple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left -- all\\nthese seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So\\nmay the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre, -- the\\nhill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \\\"Norba's ancient wall,\\\" with\\nneither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it -- Ninfa's more modern\\nwall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,\\nruined churches, in abundance -- all these may be connected with an\\n iter ad Brundisium , but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let\\nour traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway -- we were\\ngoing to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could\\nwell be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his\\ntime-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni\\nand go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.\\nNot that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the\\ngates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It\\nwould most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,\\nprince of guidebook-makers, recommends the locanda there as \\\"reinlich\\nund eidlich,\\\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller\\nwill be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more\\ninclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is\\nno doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,\\nAnagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is\\nthe first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is\\nnot unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make\\nAnagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest\\nfor the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome\\nbut from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points\\nin some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he\\nwill be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,\\nalmost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is\\nas the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met\\nhis end, the prisoner -- not the last Pope who was fated so to be -- of\\na French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the\\nmind. In medi\\u00e6val history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to\\nthis day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress\\nmeaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.\\nAnagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore\\ndid not suffer at the hands of Renaissance Popes as Rome lived to\\nsuffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well\\ngo back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,\\nthen Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome\\nwhich neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and\\nPyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in\\nwhich Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation\\nof the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is\\nharder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading\\nOld-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few\\npersonal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or\\nOld-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical\\nor legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,\\nand the one great event in their political history; and those tell us\\na great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom\\nSpurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great\\nTriple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having\\nneither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,\\nthey hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.\\nBut their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust\\nin as they were between \\u00c6quians and Volscians, no alliance could\\nbe more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most\\nexposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself\\nwas the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle\\nmust have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must\\nhave looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants\\nof the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have\\nendured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening\\nneighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to\\nanother, we better understand the political relations of the endless\\nlittle communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The\\nally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need\\nto climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack\\nor deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them\\ntherefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare\\nand without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but\\nthey were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's\\nsight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at\\nAnagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either\\nat Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If\\nin some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less\\nclearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as\\nits symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one\\nanother could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.\\nThey must be always doing something to one another in the way either\\nof friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when\\nSpurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the\\nfirst Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land\\nand its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed\\nput a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.\\n\\nWe come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded\\nin by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni\\nand Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an\\nisolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,\\nthe city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the\\nhill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the\\nmiddle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief\\nstreet between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the\\nhill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,\\nthan can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,\\nallowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,\\nand a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must\\nconfess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well\\ntheir bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works\\nof the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the\\ndifference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious\\nforms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring\\nus back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by\\nordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord\\nMacaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there\\nwould have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \\\"no work of\\nearthly men,\\\" or as -- \\n\\n Reared by the hands of giants\\n For godlike kings of old.\\n\\nThe walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome\\nare wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to\\nput together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it\\nwas to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who\\nthoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use\\nit with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,\\nround the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they\\nare broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others\\nmerely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone\\nthrough all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the\\ncourse of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a\\nwhole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a\\ngood deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to\\ntheir nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.\\nIn some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by\\nfurther defences, buttresses rather than towers -- defences, by-the-way,\\nwhich must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later\\ntimes. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,\\ngreater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and\\nalways laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of\\nlarger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones\\nof two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a\\nlight-coloured stone exactly like the puff-stone of Gloucestershire,\\nthe material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings\\nin that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark\\nvolcanic peperino , which, towards the south-eastern part of the wall,\\nis used much more freely. The general effect, wherever the wall is at\\nall perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and\\ncolour.\\n\\nNow was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a\\ncertain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back\\nto our library; we take down the Dictionary of Geography ; we turn to\\nthe article \\\"Anagnia,\\\" and we find that by far the best contributor to\\nthe series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings\\nare damped when he says, \\\"The only remains extant there are of Roman\\ndate and of little interest.\\\" As to the \\\"little interest,\\\" we venture\\nto have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great\\nan extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an\\nobject of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the\\nlatest days which could come under the definition of \\\"Roman date.\\\"\\nBut what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of\\nthe Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us\\nto believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic\\nEmperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call\\nthe Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For\\nMarcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \\\" Flamen sume\\nsamentum .\\\" He did not know what \\\" samentum \\\" meant, and we cannot find\\nthe word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its\\nmeaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which\\nthe flamen put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want\\nto be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans\\nat some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they\\nhad no fellowship with the prim\\u00e6val works at Cori and at Segni; they\\ndid seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at\\nRome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the\\nwalls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from\\na Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were\\nburthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may\\ncarry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read\\nbetween four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,\\nwe shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the\\ndays of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have\\nlooked.\\n\\nOne thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the\\nbuilders of the cloaca at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders\\nof Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On\\nthe highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out\\ntowards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient arx , we may\\nstill see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised\\nby the arrangements of the medi\\u00e6val castle, the double gate of the\\nancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well\\nturned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same\\nworkmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the\\nbeginning. The arx itself, it should be remembered, had its separate\\nwall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the\\nsame character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street\\na little lower down.\\n\\nWhen we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character\\nin which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican\\nwalls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is\\nso far more famous as the city of medi\\u00e6val Popes that it is fitting\\nthat it should have something to show in that character also. The\\ntown is rich in medi\\u00e6val fragments. The main street, in its winding\\ncourses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,\\nwhich, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,\\nno small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with\\narches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one\\npapal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent\\nBishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for\\ntheir span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal\\npalace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,\\non its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France\\nor England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases\\noften present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the\\nmain street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches\\nresting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And\\nan elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender\\nshaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless\\nto add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these\\nrelics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured\\nand mutilated.\\n\\nIn the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good\\nfragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but\\nthe cathedral church within the arx is the only one which has the\\nleast claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on\\nthe edge of the hill with its east end -- that is, what would be east\\naccording to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west -- rising\\nup nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a\\nstately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on\\ntwo sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is\\nin a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the\\nchurch is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of\\nthe Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,\\nless satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains\\nthe vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many\\nother curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;\\nlet us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at\\nleast, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern\\nof the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the\\nmother-church of Rome and of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Ferentino.\\n\\n\\nItaly contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,\\nas England contains two places -- perhaps more -- bearing the several\\nnames of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,\\nRochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester\\nis also very conveniently written Rutchester , so the Etruscan\\nFerentinum is also conveniently written Ferentia . On an iter ad\\nBrundisium we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan\\nFerentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to\\nthe Itineraries, was to be found on the Via Latina between Anagnia\\nand Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name\\nof the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,\\nits ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is\\nHernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet\\nit is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the\\nendless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other\\ncompany that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest\\nremembrance of the name places \\\"Ferentinum of the rock\\\" among the\\nThirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot\\nwith the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the\\nrule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where -- \\n\\n ... in the centre thickest\\n Were ranged the shields of foes,\\n And from the centre loudest\\n The cry of battle rose.\\n\\nYet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to\\nfind a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican\\nhills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant\\ncomrades as Tibur and Pedum and \\\"Gabii of the pool.\\\" And, when we\\ncome back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more\\nand more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in\\nthat list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess -- among a\\nhundred other guesses -- at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next\\nbefore Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near\\nto our mark as Fortinei ; so we may hope for the best; but remembering\\nwhere Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes\\nare small.\\n\\nIn obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way\\nto Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take\\nin the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.\\nTill we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that\\nAnagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and\\nthe rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill\\nof Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that\\nthe spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \\\"Ferentinum\\nof the rock.\\\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many\\nother hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we\\nbegin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord\\nMacaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has\\nat least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the\\nrock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,\\nand sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.\\nAnd the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of\\nour series. They are still standing through the greater part of their\\nancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,\\ndiffering in material and construction. There is an original lower\\npart of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as\\nrude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which\\nthis earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,\\nbut it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later\\nrepairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction\\nof very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were\\nnot for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work\\nhas a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction\\nand material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work\\nby the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the\\narch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.\\nThe only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with\\nmerely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from\\nthe modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones\\nof the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient\\nentrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they\\nwere, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take\\na military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.\\nAnother gate, now known as Porta Maggiore , is a much more elaborate\\nwork, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is\\nplaced with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall\\nturns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great\\nadvantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows\\nwhether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult\\njust at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes\\nleast interesting. When we have to scramble -- all at least save Alpine\\nclimbers -- with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,\\nwe are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of\\nconstruction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to\\nrefer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no\\nsuch necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,\\nand the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed\\nat the same time. And at one point, not far from the Porta Maggiore ,\\nit will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long\\ninscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,\\nAulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part\\nat Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later\\nat Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of\\nhis day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty\\nbushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the\\nboys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the\\nwill of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity\\nCommissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get\\ntheir nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance -- yet\\nmany well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf -- will they\\ndevise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the\\nbenefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions\\nnearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the Times \\nwas filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in\\nSomerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once\\nstanding in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In\\none point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more\\nlucky. When Ferentinum had quatuorviri , they did not bury people in\\ntheir temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to\\npeople who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates\\nthe bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to\\nbe seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,\\nas a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his\\nbenefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated\\nby Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we\\ntrust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,\\nPopes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull\\ndown buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and\\nvillas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which\\nshould go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.\\n\\nWe have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we\\nwish -- we must confess the weakness -- to see independent Hernicans\\nwherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come\\nback and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum\\nspoken of, without any special emotion, as \\\"Roman.\\\" We look up\\nagain in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word\\ncertainly means something quite different from what it commonly\\nmeans in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light\\non anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us\\nto accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far\\nback as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think\\nthat the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old\\nCorinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great\\npiece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more\\nimportant -- though about the comparative importance some might raise a\\ndoubt -- than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them\\nby the proper road; we must get into what once was the arx , what\\nis now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,\\necclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly\\nthrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or\\nhouses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that\\nFerentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,\\nand several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed\\nat Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept\\nasunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the\\nsmall and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The\\nmost striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the\\nmass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the\\nbell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the arx , as a\\nmighty sub-structure. The walls of the arx show the same two dates\\nas the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude\\nstones of the first period; at another part they support the upper\\nrange of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to\\nHernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the\\n\\\"Roman\\\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of\\nthe censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius -- censors, that is, not\\nof Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first\\nvolume of the great Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , p. 238, and\\nits closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the Priscae\\nLatinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica . Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus\\nLollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known\\npersons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one\\nasks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got\\nhold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They\\nhad no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they\\nare written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the\\nRoman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have\\nbuilt what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside\\nonly mean that they built the later work on the top of the prim\\u00e6val\\nwall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an\\narchaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in\\nthe Tabularium of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row\\nof triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \\\"Cornelius Lucius Scipio\\nGnaivod patre prognatus.\\\" But we need not go back quite so far as his\\nday. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla\\nwill do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans\\nof Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.\\nFerentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns\\nwhich were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows\\nis most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,\\nrefused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather\\nto remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,\\nthe old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of\\nthe Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and\\nmagistrates -- Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them -- subject\\nonly to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars\\nof Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful\\nRomans.\\n\\nThis last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.\\n3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth\\nthe wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman pr\\u00e6tor suddenly\\nwished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for\\nherself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so\\nher husband bade the two qu\\u00e6stors of the town to be seized; one was\\nscourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the\\nwords of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which\\nRoman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities\\neven of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.\\n\\nIt is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the town as\\na municipium , while Livy also casually implies its possession of the\\nLatin franchise. Such obiter dicta do not go for very much. Scholars\\nsometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only\\ncasual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus\\nnot long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to\\naccuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the\\nWest of England. We here read of \\\"the county of the city of Bristol,\\\"\\nthe \\\"borough of Gloucester,\\\" the \\\"borough of Bath,\\\" and the \\\"borough of\\nTaunton.\\\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting\\nthat Bath is a \\\"city\\\" and Gloucester even a \\\"county of a city.\\\" May\\nwe not sometimes get wrong about municipia and Latin colonies from\\nthe same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a\\n municipium , but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,\\nwe once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the\\nelectors of a county to elect, not a \\\"knight of the shire,\\\" as they\\nhad done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called\\na \\\"member of Parliament.\\\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and\\neven Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,\\n curiae , and centuries, in ages long before their own day?\\n\\nThe walls then, though called \\\"Roman\\\" in a vague sense -- that is, it\\nwould seem, simply not prim\\u00e6val, like those of Cori and Segni -- are\\ndoubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was\\nstill a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most\\nlikely the walls over which the unlucky qu\\u00e6stor threw himself. The\\nwalls of the arx , where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,\\nconnect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the\\ninscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and\\nfrom the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral -- a\\nvery good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.\\nThe church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal\\ndamaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its\\nbell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A\\nlittle restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make\\nit into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,\\nunless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,\\nantiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little\\nminster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except\\nby comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if\\nthe church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime\\nof the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what\\nwe heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the\\ncrime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually\\nbegun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as\\nyet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse\\nto drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.\\n\\nThe church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen\\nthere in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant\\nvoice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the\\n arx -- buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account -- strange\\ntales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place\\neither in history or in received legend. Among other things he was\\nthrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a\\nvery pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one\\ndesigns to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,\\nit strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or\\nas we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other\\necclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city\\nof the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these\\nplaces; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which\\nhas an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people\\nwho chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome\\nlose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy\\nplaces of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and\\nanother creed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. Alatri.\\n\\n\\nThe tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with prim\\u00e6val walls, among\\nwhich we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at\\nAlatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly\\nclaim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest\\nplace, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is\\nthe one which has the least history. There is very little to say about\\nit, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but\\npreferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the\\nproffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained\\na distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least\\nthere can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich\\nin medi\\u00e6val antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich\\nin Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or\\nless Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri\\nnearly everything that we care about is strictly prim\\u00e6val. We cannot\\nreasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look\\nwere there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new\\nthen.\\n\\nAlatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in\\nall ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no\\nplace in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni\\nor Ferentino -- nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of\\ngoing and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked\\non as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without\\ncalling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are\\nnow following -- a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among\\nthem -- reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there\\nafter seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant\\njustice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed\\nit out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a\\nresting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of\\nAlatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from\\nits railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern\\nworld, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible\\nbell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to\\nAlatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for\\na while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what\\nthey saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the\\nAlatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of\\nthe walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the arx , are the most\\nprominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond\\nour immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited\\ntown. At Alatri indeed the prim\\u00e6val walls are so prominent that in the\\ndistant view no one would suspect them of being prim\\u00e6val walls at all.\\nThey are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what\\nmay be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still\\nfence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as\\nin so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal\\nprecinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and\\ncentral character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The arx \\nis not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the\\nwall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The arx \\nforms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point\\nof the compass on the mountains which keep watch around -- on the little\\ntowns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights -- on\\nthe houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill\\nwhich the arx crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a\\nchurch or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding\\nsite, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These\\nhill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;\\nat Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their\\nheights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper\\ncompanions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which\\nsurrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more\\nworthy building, either the prim\\u00e6val temple itself or some more fitting\\nsuccessor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs -- let\\nus say either the Parthen\\u00f4n of Athens or the Parthen\\u00f4n of Lincoln to\\ndo it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral\\nchurch of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the\\n cella of the prim\\u00e6val temple. Here we have something even more than\\ncan be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way\\nof a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are\\nconcerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church\\nwas actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house\\ngoing back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded\\nage which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There\\nis the terrace, there is the wall of the cella , wrought of the same\\nwonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding arx , as the walls\\nof the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the\\nordinary rites of Christian worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a\\nChristian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples\\nof a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them\\nwithin walls reared in honour of we know not what -- gods of unchronicled\\ndays, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed\\nas strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of\\nJupiter of the Capitol.\\n\\nWhere the pr\\u00e6historic temple has thus become the cathedral church, it\\nis not out of keeping that the wall of the pr\\u00e6historic arx should\\nbecome the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see\\nfrom afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly\\nfurnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can\\ndistinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air\\nof a wall even of Roman, even of medi\\u00e6val, antiquity. Shall we say it?\\nAs we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the arx of\\nAlatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We\\ncould not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular\\nand rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than\\nat Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls\\nin the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls\\nbuilt on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business\\ncommonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,\\nto strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have\\nlittle or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached\\nfrom within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this\\narrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a\\nwall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.\\nThe weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at\\nthis point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which\\nthe hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are\\nwhich are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in\\nthe walls of Alatri, whether of temple, arx , or city, do we find\\nanything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the\\nstones, of whatever shape -- and they are of many shapes -- have clearly\\nbeen cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though\\nthe system according to which they are laid is not the same in every\\npart of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of\\nconstructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be\\nseen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it\\nis hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor\\ndo we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where\\nwe should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The\\ngreat gateway of the arx at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its\\nbuilders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of\\nthe arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of\\nthe lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. We suppose\\nthat the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge\\nlintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals\\nwhom those of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea could not have despised. But, except in vastness\\nof construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly\\nplain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with\\nthe really artistic work of the Myk\\u00eanaian treasuries. It goes rather\\nwith the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri\\ncould carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the arx .\\nBut they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great\\ngate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of\\nthe vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the\\ncut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within\\nit, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the\\nsteep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.\\nEven the builders of prim\\u00e6val walls clearly drew a line between what\\nwas meant to meet the public eye and what was not.\\n\\nBut we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,\\nthe walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of\\nAlatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect\\nin the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be\\ntempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular\\norder by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these\\nlast, except that they do not supply anything like the prim\\u00e6val gate,\\nare just as well worthy of study as the walls of the arx itself. They\\nremain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and\\nthey are of the same general construction as the walls of the arx .\\nAt some points a singular contrast is made by medi\\u00e6val additions to\\nthe defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic\\nwindows of the time, stands out as projections from the prim\\u00e6val wall.\\nAnd, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in\\nthe way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the\\nwalls themselves. From the arx of Alatri we look down on several\\nbell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is\\nquite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point\\nof Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or\\nout of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided\\nshaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow\\nstreets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory\\nin every point save one. There should have been some decent building,\\npagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its arx , the noblest\\nin our whole range.\\n\\nWith Alatri we end one main stage of our iter , that of the\\nhill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in\\nthe world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if\\nwe had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of\\nwork. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant\\nand profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and\\nthe Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns\\nare very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in\\nwithout anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to\\nmention that the Locanda d'Italia , at Anagni, recommended in various\\nguide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a\\nnight at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless\\nand letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better\\nthan many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.\\nIndeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed\\nrace. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,\\nperhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make\\nthe best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need\\nbe; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or\\nhe might be a Hernican -- we cannot always be exact among these obsolete\\nnationalities -- \\\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. From Alatri to Capua.\\n\\n\\nWe have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not\\nbe hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling\\nin historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to\\nexisting remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the\\nspecial necessities of an iter ad Brundisium carry us to quite other\\nparts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest\\nare fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they\\nare wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their\\nlowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our\\nwork is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant\\ncompanions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their\\nsubstitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond\\nit. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can\\ncarry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway\\nsystem of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea\\nand the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,\\nbeyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters\\nto the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a\\nchance likeness between the names -- a name that ranges from the Euxine\\nto the Hudson -- without seeking in any sort to identify the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of\\nDionysios and the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of imperial Anna, it is still with a curious\\nfeeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before were\\nlooking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the wilder\\nmountains of Albania.\\n\\nSome of those who now looked across had already learned something of\\nthose heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new\\nfeeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look\\nout on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the\\nwestern world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped\\nthemselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the\\nAlbanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to\\nbeing to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to\\nthe East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the\\nboot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on\\nthe western side of the great backbone of Italy; we have still to catch\\nglimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on\\nthe bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of\\ncloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which\\ndecrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must\\ngo and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time\\nwe have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive\\nrange of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass\\nfrom the prim\\u00e6val cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of\\nsouth-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series\\nof churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but\\ntheir memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,\\nnot indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days\\nwhen Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of\\nHellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those\\neastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.\\n\\nGreek influence indeed begins -- some say that it historically began -- on\\nthe western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the\\npresent journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.\\nWe hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from\\nFrosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding\\nourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be\\npassed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious\\ndiscomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that\\nit is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized\\nquarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,\\nhowever, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a\\nfew miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts -- we\\nwill not talk of luxuries -- have fled from Capua and have found their\\nnew home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,\\n Santa Maria di vetere Capua , not the newer Capua on the site of\\nCasilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there\\nagain, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in\\nthe way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far\\nin advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to\\nLondon. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.\\nThe name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early medi\\u00e6val\\nCapua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the\\ntown now called Capua, but at the village -- it is hardly more -- of Santa\\nMaria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of\\nSamnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the\\ncity where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of\\nblood.\\n\\nOn our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or\\nnew. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder\\nCapua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has\\nbeen chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the\\nhistoric traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at\\neither, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small\\nvalue in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.\\nIt is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,\\nto look again on the amphitheatre of Capua -- Capua, the mistress of\\nRome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of\\namphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,\\neven of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with\\na general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan\\namphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they\\nhardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far\\nless perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than\\nat Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman\\nColiseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,\\nwhile of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how\\nmuch is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the medi\\u00e6val\\nbarons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than\\nat Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up\\nfrom underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.\\nIf any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is\\nnot a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that\\nthe inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation\\nand enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems\\nto imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at\\nleast, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It\\nillustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the\\ntaste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.\\n\\nBesides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes\\nand designs which line the road -- one of which is indeed singularly\\nlike a model of an amphitheatre -- the true Capua has little to show\\nbesides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,\\none which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid\\nthan Rome, so utterly gone -- or rather to see the little that is left of\\nit translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we\\nbegin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,\\nremained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the\\nlast remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.\\nAs such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the\\ncity itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may\\nbe sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city\\nby the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian\\nriver, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni\\nand Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than\\nFlorence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking\\nof the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the arx of\\nCapua could have stood, if we are to understand by an arx something\\nset upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to\\nlater ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The\\nSamnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,\\nhad become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of\\nthe mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.\\n\\n \\\"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\\\"\\n\\nsays the line which comes as such a relief after the involved\\nconstructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as\\nsimply worded as it could be in a medi\\u00e6val chronicle, which gives us\\na true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without\\na single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was\\ndoubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,\\nwho had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment\\nto the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was\\nlargely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the\\nlarge amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any\\nmeasure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua\\nfor a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the\\nRoman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who\\nfilled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once\\nmore a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came\\nnot as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,\\nand when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the\\nkeeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those\\nremnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the arx of Capua, are not\\nto be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his\\nfirst or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan\\n arx , he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their\\nlowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the\\nCampanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we\\ncome to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way\\nto a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan\\namphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of\\nTifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his\\ncamp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the\\nholy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain\\nwhich rises above its massy tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.\\n\\n\\nWe reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching\\nof Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of\\nbeleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout\\nfighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his\\nlast hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the\\ndanger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in\\nsome tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks\\nwhich doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no\\nlake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend\\non Tifata as grew round -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nYet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent\\nforth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest\\nforms into which any kind of Italian or Hellenic worship strayed\\nmight well seem mild. In tracking the career of Hannibal, we are ever\\ndisappointed at the utter lack of means to call up a picture of the\\nman himself apart from his public acts. He had human weaknesses, for\\nhe found a mistress at Salapia. He had his sallies of merriment, for\\nhe could raise a laugh at the grave Gisgo. But the course of his inner\\nlife is hidden from us. Still we can at least see that he was, in his\\nown belief, charged with a mission from the gods of his own city. And\\nit needs an effort to bear in mind that the gods of Hannibal were Baal\\nand Moloch. The goddess to whom he would have reared a temple would\\nhave been, not a Diana, but an Ashtoreth. Yet, among the many, and\\nmostly false, charges of cruelty brought against the great Ph\\u0153nician\\nby Roman writers, we do not hear, as we do in the case of some other\\nCarthaginian commanders, of captives being made to pass through the\\nfire to the gods of Carthage. Hannibal, the friend of Capua, would at\\nCapua honour Diana of Tifata; but it was not Diana that had sent him.\\nWith what thanks did he honour his own gods, when Capua, second city\\nof all Italy, welcomed the victor of Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cann\\u00e6? Is\\nit too bold a flight to fancy the mount of Tifata the scene of the same\\nform of Baal-worship as the mount of Carmel?\\n\\nBut the gods of Italy lived on, undisturbed by the momentary presence\\nof Semitic rivals. Diana was not the only power worshipped on Tifata;\\nJupiter also had his holy place. And it may be that the venerable\\nchurch which now forms the chief attraction of the hill-side represents\\nthe holy place of Jupiter rather than the holy place of Diana. It is\\ncurious to see how a kind of appropriateness was often sought after in\\nthe nomenclature of Pagan temples when turned into Christian churches.\\nThus, at Athens, the Parthen\\u00f4n remained the Parthen\\u00f4n, while the temple\\nof the warrior Th\\u00easeus or H\\u00earakl\\u00eas became the church of the warrior\\nGeorge. We should look for a Santa Maria or a Santa Lucia at\\nthe least, on the site of the sanctuary of Diana. Had we here a San\\nPietro , we should have very little doubt in setting down the prince\\nof the Apostles as having supplanted the father of gods and men. But\\nat Sant' Angelo in Formis we feel somewhat less certain; St. Michael\\nsuggests the Norman, and the Norman has been there. It may well be that\\nthe name is no older than his day.\\n\\nBut St. Michael on the slope of Tifata did carry us back in thought to\\na church of St. Peter seen some months before under a widely different\\nstate of outward things. We then made a somewhat difficult journey to a\\ngreat and solitary Tuscan basilica in time of snow. The outward aspect\\nof nature had certainly changed a good deal between the bleak day in\\nJanuary when it was found a hard task to follow the way from Pisa to\\nthe basilica of the prince of the Apostles in Grado and the sunny day\\nin May when the same travellers found their way without difficulties of\\nany kind to the basilica of the prince of the archangels in Formis .\\nAnd there certainly can be no likeness of position, even if both were\\nseen in January or both in May, between the basilica standing low in\\nthe flats by the mouth of Arno and the basilica which nestles against\\nthe mountains which form a wall to the rich plain of Vulturnus. But\\nin seeing any one of these great churches, left, not ruined, like\\nour Cistercian abbeys, but still living on a kind of life in places\\nforsaken or nearly so, something always brings up the memory of some\\nother of its fellows. Aquileia is perhaps the greatest case of all; but\\nAquileia, with its special position in the history of the world, stands\\nby itself. If Aquileia itself is dead, it has lived on a wonderful\\nafter-life in the shape of its Venetian colony. We go to see Aquileia,\\nbecause it is Aquileia; but even a well-informed traveller may know\\nnothing of San Pietro in Grado and Sant' Angelo in Formis , till\\neither his guide-book or some earlier visitor points them out to him\\nas places which he ought not to pass by. Aquileia again has other\\nthings to show besides the great basilica and its surroundings. St.\\nApollinaris in Classe is as nearly forsaken as a church that is still\\nkept up can be; but the basilica of Classis does not stand by itself;\\nit forms part of the wonders of Ravenna, as St. Paul without-the-Walls\\nforms part of the wonders of Rome. St. Peter in Grado might be looked\\non as standing in the same relation to Pisa; but it hardly enters\\ninto our general conception of Pisa, as the church of Classis -- papal\\nhavoc hinders us from adding the church of C\\u00e6sarea -- certainly enters\\ninto our general conception of Ravenna. S. Angelo in Formis at all\\nevents does not enter into our general conception of old Capua, because\\nthere is not enough of old Capua left to form any general conception\\nof it at all. The church and the small surrounding village do form\\na kind of distant arx to the greater collection of houses which\\nsurrounds the amphitheatre; but among the nearer objects which catch\\nthe eye from the height, the most prominent is not old Capua with its\\namphitheatre, but new Capua, Casilinum that once was, with its towers\\nand cupolas, medi\\u00e6val and modern. We look on many things from the\\nterrace in front of the portico of the archangel, but that which among\\nartificial objects chiefly draws the eye towards it, is not the elder\\nCapua of Hannibal and Marcellus, but the Capua which succeeded Aversa\\nas the seat of the elder but the less famous of the Norman powers in\\nSouthern Italy. As we mark the advance of national union, no less than\\nas we mark the advance of mere dynastic aggression, we have sometimes\\nto think, for a moment perhaps to mourn, that \\\"kingdoms have shrunk\\nto provinces,\\\" though in this form of advance and incorporation, we\\nhave no longer to add that \\\"chains clank over sceptred cities.\\\" Capua,\\non both its sites, once the head of an Etruscan, once of a Norman\\ndominion, passed, in one age, under the universal rule of Rome. In\\nanother age it again sank from its separate headship to become a member\\nof that greater Norman dominion in Apulia and Sicily which, after\\nmore shiftings, unions, divisions, transfers to distant rulers, than\\nany other part of Europe, has in our days been merged in the realm of\\nunited Italy, with Rome as its head, but not its mistress.\\n\\nWe reach then the height which, whether that of Jupiter or Diana of\\nold, is now the height of the warrior archangel. The whole history of\\nthe church belongs to the independent days of the second Capua; in its\\npresent shape it belongs to the days of independent Norman rule in the\\nsecond Capua. But the days of independent Norman rule were days when\\nthe arts of the earlier rulers of the land still lived on. We see signs\\nof the art of Byzantium, so long mistress of Southern Italy, and of\\nthe art of the Saracen, in Italy only a visitor or an invader, while in\\nSicily an abiding master. The portico in front of the church is Roman\\nin its general idea; but, instead of the colonnade and entablature\\nof the Laurentian basilica, we see an arcade whose pointed arches at\\nonce call up memories of Sicily. They have indeed little of Sicilian\\ngrace. Nowhere at Palermo or Monreale do we see such massive columns\\nbearing such massive stilts. Columns indeed we should hardly say, as\\nsome of them are plainly mere fragments. But here, just as in Sicily,\\njust as in Aquitaine, the pointed arch is no sign of coming Gothic;\\nthe style is still wholly Romanesque, and somewhat rude Romanesque\\ntoo. And in this region of Italy we can hardly doubt as to attributing\\nthe almost accidental shape of the arches to the influence of Saracen\\nmodels, perhaps to the workmanship of Saracen craftsmen. Hard by, but\\nnot joining the building, by an arrangement unlike Sicily, unlike\\nApulia, but the common rule of Northern Italy, rises a bell-tower,\\nor rather the beginning of a bell-tower, which raises our wonder as\\nto what it would have been if it had ever grown to its full height.\\nTwo stages only are finished, the lower of hewn stone, the upper of\\nbrick; but their bulk is so great that the tower, if it had ever been\\nfinished, would surely have ranked among the highest of its class,\\nutterly overpowering even the great basilica at its side, except so\\nfar as it would have been itself overpowered by the natural heights\\nabove it. As in some other cases, the thought suggests itself, were not\\nthose who left off building the tower wiser than those who began it?\\nThe tall bell-towers of Italy look well as they rise from the Lombard\\nplain, as they crown the hill of Fiesole, as they skirt the shores of\\nthe lake of Como. But we are not sure that a gigantic tower, which, if\\nit was to have any kind of proportion, ought to have been carried up\\nto a height as great as that of Venice, was in its right place when\\nset a little way up a mountain-side, as if simply to show how small\\nman's biggest works look in the midst of the works of nature. But the\\ntechnical eye is thankful for the fragment that has been built, though\\nmainly on a very technical ground. Professor Willis is gone, but his\\nhappy phrase of mid-wall shafts has not died with him. The custom\\nof the elder Romanesque towers, the abiding fashion of Germany and\\nNorthern Italy, was to set the little columns which divided the coupled\\nwindows in the very middle of the wall; the latter Norman fashion,\\nwhether in Normandy, in England, or in Apulia, was to set them nearly\\nflush with the outer wall. In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman\\nby allegiance, two sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman\\nfashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters\\nof detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious\\nthought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise\\nbetween two rival forms of taste.\\n\\nThe outside of this church, except so far as it forms an object in\\nthe general landscape, is perhaps chiefly attractive to the technical\\nobserver; the inside will surely appeal to every visitor, though the\\nvisitor who is technically informed in matters of painting may possibly\\nlook upon it with more of curiosity than of positive admiration. But\\nthe eye of the more general inquirer will give something like positive\\nadmiration to a basilica of eight arches, resting on ancient columns\\nof various marbles, with its original design far less damaged than is\\ncommon in Italian churches, and with every inch of available space\\ncovered with elaborate paintings of the date of the building. Like\\nSt. Peter by Pisa, the archangel by Capua trusted to painting for his\\nenrichment and not to mosaics; and though the Campanian pictures are by\\nfar the better preserved of the two, though nearly all the subjects can\\nbe made out with the greatest ease, yet Ravenna and Venice rise to the\\nmind to make us think that at least if endurance be the object, there\\nis a more excellent way.\\n\\nThe walls of this church form almost a pictorial Bible, with a few\\nlegendary and local subjects thrown in. The Abbot Desiderius, holding,\\nafter the usual symbolical fashion, the church in his hand, is to be\\nseen at the east end along with the archangels and evangelists. At\\nthe west end is what connoisseurs tell us is one of the very earliest\\npictures of the Last Judgment. On the two sides a crowd of scenes and\\nfigures from the Old and New Testament cover the whole space. The style\\nof the painting is said to show Greek workmanship; we look toward the\\nwest end and mark, hardly above the ground, a single small shaft with\\na capital of strictly Byzantine character. The ruling Norman seems on\\nthis spot to have pressed into his service the artistic powers of all\\nthe inhabitants of the peninsula. Italian, Greek, Saracen, all give\\ntheir help to adorn the house of the archangel. The Norman himself\\ncontributes nothing but the position of two small columns in the tower\\nwindows. We cannot even attribute to him the position of the house of\\nthe archangel, set Norman-fashion in a high place; for the first church\\nwas built before the Norman came. It is not so further east, where a\\ndistinctively Norman element is to be seen in the great churches of\\nApulia. But the gathering together of the best skill of the time from\\nall quarters is a thoroughly Norman function, whether in Italy or in\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe basilica should be compassed, so far at least as to climb the\\nhill a little way to look at its east end. Its surrounding buildings\\nsupply an arch or two to catch the eye on the way up or down. But the\\nessential features of Sant' Angelo are the grand display of painting\\nand the union of elements of so many kinds. It is the first of a great\\nseries of churches at which our course will bid us to stop here and\\nthere. But before we reach them we shall pass by one point where our\\nmusings will again be mainly secular and largely pagan. A short journey\\nwill lead us from Campania into Samnium, and the valiant men of the\\nSamnite land will claim a tribute on a spot which is Samnite beyond all\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. A Glimpse of Samnium.\\n\\n\\nFrom Caserta and what is to be seen from Caserta, our next journey lies\\nby the line of railway which runs right across Italy, connecting the\\ntwo great lines of the east and west of the peninsula. It leads us from\\nthe Campanian plain, with at least its sheltering wall of mountains,\\nwith Tifata to guard the great city that once was from the ruder land\\nbeyond, to the great plain of Apulia from which every feature of a\\nmountain-land has passed away. But, in so crossing from one side of\\nItaly to the other, we pass through a striking and an historic region.\\nWe are in the land of the mightiest Italian rivals of Rome, the land\\nof those with whom Rome had to fight, before Pyrrhos and Hannibal came,\\nand ages after Pyrrhos and Hannibal were gone.\\n\\nOur course leads us into the heart of the Samnite land, a land which\\nmay well call up endless musings on the hard fate of those \\\"hearts of\\nsteel\\\" who bore up so long against Rome, in the days when Rome was\\nreally at her greatest. And the memories of the same land in after\\ndays are not wholly alien to those of earlier times. Our course brings\\nus, at not a few points, across the memories, if not of nations, yet\\nof men, who had to bear up against the power of Rome, when the power\\nof Rome had taken a far other form than that of the senate and the\\narmies against which the Samnite had to strive. For the old Samnite\\nland holds its place in later story, as the land of princes who felt\\nwhat the spiritual Rome could do when the powers of the spiritual\\nRome were at their highest. We pass through regions which were the\\nscene of no small part of the history of the Norman and Swabian lords\\nof Sicily and Southern Italy. We are deep in the land of the counts,\\ndukes, kings, and emperors of the house of Hauteville and the house\\nof Hohenstaufen; and we are often called on to stop and track out\\ntheir deeds. At not a few points do we light on some building, some\\ninscription, which brings up the memory of Frederick, the Wonder of\\nthe World, and of Manfred, whose field of overthrow we shall presently\\npass by. In both periods the history of these lands has a character\\naltogether different from that of Northern and Central Italy. In the\\nlater period this needs no proof: we are dealing with the history of\\na kingdom, not with the history of a system of separate cities. But\\nsomething of the same difference extends to the earlier period also. If\\nwe wish to know more of Volscians and Hernicans, yet more keenly do we\\nwish to know more of Samnites. The part which they played is greater,\\nat all events in scale, and their dealings with Rome belong to a stage\\nof Roman history when we feel that we have a kind of right to know\\nmore than we could hope to know in the earlier time. But while we know\\nsomething of the character of the Samnite people as a whole, while we\\nknow something -- though much less than in some other Italian lands -- of\\nthe geography of the Samnite country, we have no clear notion of the\\npolitical position or the political action of any particular Samnite\\ncity or canton, such as we ever and anon do get of particular cities\\nof Etruria and Latium. And again, it is seldom that we can call up\\nany distinct personal conception of any Samnite leader as a living and\\nbreathing man. This is indeed a grievance which affects Samnites along\\nwith the other Italian enemies of Rome. The personal conceptions which\\nwe do get of Etruscans and Latins largely belong to legendary times. Of\\nhistorical Volscians we know very few. And we have already complained\\non Hernican ground that we cannot picture to ourselves the personal\\nlikeness of any single Hernican of independent Hernican days.\\n\\nStill, on this particular journey we have small right to complain;\\nfor we pass by the spot which calls up the memories of the most\\nmemorable Samnites of whom we have any personal knowledge. They are\\nmen of one name, most likely therefore of one house, and men of whom\\nwe emphatically wish to know more than we do know. Leaving Caserta\\nbehind, glancing at the Campanian plain and the Campanian mountains,\\nmarking Naples only by the smoke of the distant city, we pass along\\nthrough what, in our simplicity, we take to be the vale of Vulturnus,\\ntill we light on a more classical friend, armed with a more classical\\nmap, who explains that the stream which we are tracing is in strictness\\nnot Vulturnus himself, but only his tributary Calor. Anyhow we go\\nalong its course into the heart of the Samnite land, and we pass by\\none spot -- a spot which we ought to have treated better than merely to\\npass it by, a spot round which the greatest memories of Samnite history\\ngather, and where they strangely interweave themselves with wholly\\ndifferent memories of the history of our own land. We reach Telesia,\\nthe home of the Pontii, and we remember that Telesia was also for a\\nmoment the home of Anselm. Our guide-book provokingly fails us; but\\nthe large building on the hill-side must surely be the monastery where\\nhe sojourned. There are Roman antiquities in the place; for Samnite\\nantiquities we do not look. But did Samnites build no walls, or do the\\nmighty bulwarks of Cori and Segni mark an earlier state of things than\\nthe Sabellian occupation of Southern Italy? Anyhow, we are here at the\\nplace which has attached itself as a surname to the two most memorable\\nmen in the scanty personal history of Samnium. Here, on his own\\nground, we remember that Gaius Pontius who spared Rome's army at the\\nCaudine Forks, and who lived to be led, twenty-seven years later, as a\\nspectacle in a Roman triumph, to end his days, one might almost say as\\na martyr, by the axe of the headsman in a Roman dungeon. So we used to\\nread the tale in our youth; so moralized the historians of our youth\\nover the special baseness which handed over such a man to such an end.\\nOr are we to adopt the new reading of the tale which at least saves\\nQuintus Fabius Maximus from that special stain of blood-guiltiness\\nwhich cleaves to the canonized memory of Divus Julius? It may be\\nwell if we can believe that one of the worthiest heroes of the old\\ncommonwealth, if he could not forestall the magnanimity of Pompeius and\\nAurelian, at least did not sink to the special and petty spite of the\\nmurderer of Vercingetorix. We are now taught that the Gaius Pontius\\nwho appears twenty-seven years after the first mention of that name,\\nis most likely not the same man as the merciful victor of the Caudine\\nForks. If this be so, then Quintus Fabius, in consigning his Pontius\\nto the axe, merely conformed to the cruel custom of his nation, without\\nthe further aggravation of slaying in cold blood one who had dealt with\\nRome so nobly. And after all some might hint that the oldest Pontius\\nof all was the wisest. It may be that the sage old father of Gaius\\nknew human nature best, when he bade his son either to massacre the\\nwhole Roman army or else to let them go free without terms. It may be\\nthat the son chose a more dangerous path than either, when he took to\\ndiplomacy and middle courses.\\n\\nBut if the earlier Pontius of Telesia should prove -- though the guess\\nis a simple guess -- to be in truth two Pontii, perhaps a father and a\\nson, no doubt seems to have fixed itself on the identity of the last\\nPontius at the Colline gate of Rome. The rising again of Samnite life\\nat the last moment of all, when the war with the allies seemed to have\\nlost itself in the deeper whirlpool of the war of Marius and Sulla,\\nis really the most striking thing in the whole history, such as we\\nhave it, of the Samnite people. We are taken by surprise when, in\\ndays when Rome already seems the fully established head, not only of\\nItaly, but of all the Mediterranean world, her power, her very being,\\nis threatened by the leader of a nation which seemed to have been dead\\nand buried for some centuries. But, just like the Volumnian tomb in\\none way, so the Samnite resurrection in another way is a witness to\\nthe real life which the other states of Italy kept on under a form\\nof Roman dominion which made them externally dependent, which threw\\nits influence into the scale of oligarchy in their external affairs,\\nwhich ever and anon subjected them to some irregular demand, but which\\nleft the general course of their lives to be whatever they themselves\\nchose it to be. In the days of Marius and Sulla, Etruscans and Samnites\\nwere still Etruscans and Samnites; they had not become Romans, nor had\\nthey merged their being in any common name of Italians. The Social War\\nitself was the first attempt at forming a general Italian nationality.\\nBut the last campaign of the last Pontius shows how deep, in Samnite\\nhearts at least, was the earlier feeling, the feeling which knew\\nno greater whole than the federal union of Etruria or Samnium. It\\nshows too how specially deep was the feeling of hatred for the single\\ncity which had brought down so many cities and leagues to become its\\nhelpless dependents. Against Pontius at the Colline gate Rome fought\\nfor life, as she had never fought since the old days when she had to\\nguard herself against enemies who lived within sight of her capitol.\\nForeign invaders, Pyrrhos, Hannibal himself, did not come with the\\nsame fixed purpose of rooting up the wood which sheltered the wolves of\\nItaly. We can hardly doubt that it is the hand of Sulla which from that\\nday to this has hindered the south of Italy from being like the north.\\nBut the blow which crushed the Samnite people as the other nations of\\nItaly were not crushed, was vengeance taken for a moment when it once\\nmore became a question whether Rome should rule over Italy, whether\\nRome should exist at all.\\n\\nAt Telesia we look out, and muse on what might have been, if one\\nPontius had done otherwise than he did by the forks of Caudium, if\\nanother Pontius had fared otherwise than he fared at the gates of\\nRome herself. At our next halting-place we are called on, not to muse\\non what might have been, but on what was. At Beneventum we tread the\\nbattle-ground of Pyrrhos and Manfred, the ground of two of the greatest\\nvictories of the Rome of the earlier and the Rome of the later day.\\nThere we need not strive to call up the dim figures of men, like the\\nolder and the later Pontius, known by one action of their lives. The\\nEpeirot and the Swabian stand out as clearly discerned figures in the\\nhistory of their several ages. And the places where we next halt will\\nshow us the place of overthrow for both, the place of death and utter\\nruin for one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Benevento.\\n\\n\\nWe follow the stream of Calore till we reach a city which, without\\never having been one of the great cities of the world, without having\\nbeen even one of the greatest cities of Italy, has always kept up an\\nimportant historic being. Beneventum is a familiar name in all ages;\\nyet Beneventum has never been either a mighty commonwealth like Venice\\nor Genoa, or the head of a mighty kingdom like Naples and Palermo.\\nIt has had its princes; if we never heard of them before, we should\\nlearn a good deal of them by studying the monuments of their city.\\nThat is to say, the monuments will tell us a great deal about princes\\nnine hundred or a thousand years back; no monument that we remember in\\nBenevento tells us anything about the last prince who bore their title.\\nLet us suppose a wanderer who began his travels at Autun and who finds\\nhimself, in the course of the same wandering, at Benevento. He will\\nfeel it as a grotesque coincidence that, not so very long ago, a man\\nwas living who had once been Prince of Benevento and who before that\\nhad been Bishop of Autun. Benevento, among many other things that it\\nis, is also the later city of Talleyrand, as Autun is the earlier. But\\nthere is this difference that one thinks of Talleyrand at Autun and one\\ndoes not think of him at Benevento. At Autun he has his place, though\\na very strange place, in the long succession of Bishops of Autun; at\\nBenevento, though he bore the style of its prince, he stands all alone;\\nwe cannot find a niche for him in the succession of the Beneventan\\nprinces. Yet a prince of Benevento whose existence marks the ending\\nfor a season of the long papal dominion in Benevento reminds us that\\nBenevento had its princes before that papal dominion began. It reminds\\nus of the two distinctive features in the later history of the city.\\nBenevento was first the seat of Lombard princes who, placed on the\\nborders of both empires, contrived to escape all practical submission\\nto either; it was then the seat of an outlying scrap of papal dominion\\nsurrounded on all sides by the Sicilian realm. In both these characters\\nBenevento was a kind of curiosity on the historical map of Europe. But\\nthe city had its ups and downs before those days, and amongst other\\nthings it had gone through a somewhat grotesque change of name. It is\\nhard to believe that a city placed so far inland can really have been\\nof Greek origin; but legend attributed it to a Greek founder, and its\\noldest name had a Greek sound. Greek Maloeis , Samnite Maluentum ,\\nhad, when it was read into Latin Maloventum , an ill sound; so, when\\nthe Samnite stronghold was changed into the Roman colony, it took the\\nname of Beneventum, city of welcome.\\n\\nBeneventum, marked by Procopius as a strong city in a high place,\\nstands low as compared with the true hill-cities. Still, as compared\\nwith Capua, it might itself pass for a hill-city. It has just that\\namount of rise above the river which there commonly is where there is a\\nriver, such a rise as may be seen in many an English town which is not\\nas Durham or Lincoln. We miss the prim\\u00e6val walls of the hill-cities;\\nbut we find, on the other hand, works of Roman and medi\\u00e6val art such as\\nin the hill-cities we do not find. The arch of Trajan has vanished from\\nRome, except so far as it lives in the sculptures which were torn from\\nit to enrich the arch of Constantine. But at Benevento, as at Ancona,\\nthe memorial of the conqueror of Dacia still abides. The Beneventan\\narch may indeed fairly take its place in the Roman series. It belongs\\nessentially to the same class of designs as the arch of Severus and\\nthe arch of Constantine, while it has little in common with its own\\ntall and slender fellow at Ancona. At the same time, since it has, in\\ngeneral effect at least, taken upon itself something of the position\\nof a town-gate, since it bears the name of Porta aurea , to match the\\ngolden gate of Constantinople and the golden gate of Spalato, the arch\\nof Beneventum has now a somewhat greater air of reality than triumphal\\narches commonly have. The weak point of that class of structures\\nis that they are of no use. They do not, like a wall, a gateway, a\\nhouse, a temple, a hall of council, serve any purpose in the ordinary\\neconomy of things. They are purely monumental, set up to commemorate\\nsomething or somebody, but in no way to help on men's daily affairs,\\npublic or private. And yet they are not mere monuments, like a statue\\nor an inscribed stone. A large building of this kind, having very\\nmuch the air of a building which does serve some purpose, is a little\\ndeceptive. It is so like a real gateway that it calls up the thought\\nof a real gateway, and leaves us a little disappointed at finding that\\nthe building, after all, never was of any use to anybody, and was set\\nup simply to be looked at. There is, therefore, something a little\\nunsatisfactory in the whole class of triumphal arches, and it may even\\nbe that a slightly ludicrous element is thrown in when we find that the\\nimmediate occasion for rearing this record of the life and exploits\\nof the \\\"fortissimus princeps\\\" whom it commemorates was the repair of\\nthe Appian Way. But it does not become us to find fault with any built\\nand graven monument, specially with one of a time of which we have so\\nfew written monuments as the memorable reign of Trajan. We are so much\\nthe slaves of accidental associations, so apt to draw lines at some\\naltogether unreasonable point, that we may doubt whether the reign of\\nTrajan holds the place which it should hold in popular imagination.\\nSuetonius wrote the lives of Twelve C\\u00e6sars, and this mere accident has\\ncaused the notion of a break which has no real existence between the\\nSuetonian Twelve and those who next followed them. The reign of Trajan\\nmarks the Empire at its highest pitch of extent and power, at that\\nhighest pitch which, in its own nature, comes just before the beginning\\nof decay. His days saw, too, the highest pitch of architectural\\nmagnificence; and with Tacitus and Juvenal to adorn it, one might be\\ninclined to say that, as an age of Latin literature, the age of Trajan\\nmight hold its own against any earlier period of the Imperial rule. For\\nwe must remember that the great writers of the early days of Augustus\\nare in truth writers of the republican period living on into the\\nEmpire. The Flavian period, continued under Trajan, is quite as rich as\\nthe earlier days of the Empire itself. And we may notice that the arch\\nof Beneventum marks the reign of Trajan, and with it the Roman Empire,\\nat what was really its highest point. It was raised at a time when it\\ncould commemorate conquered Dacia and tributary Armenia. That Dacia and\\nArmenia could be brought within the range of that Roman world which is\\ncontinued in the system of modern Europe is proved by daily witnesses.\\nBut the arch of Beneventum was built too early to commemorate its\\nhero's later victories in the further East, momentary victories in\\nlands which neither Alexander nor Trajan could bring within the abiding\\nrange of Western influences.\\n\\nThe arch of Trajan is so distinctly the most famous thing in Benevento\\nthat it has carried us out of all chronological order. But the\\nhistorical interest of Beneventum lies earlier and later than Trajan's\\nday. In truth the Pax Romana forbade that the main interest of any\\nItalian city should lie in Trajan's day. We may believe or not as\\nwe please in the presence of Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas and \\u00c6neas; but Pyrrhos, Hanno,\\nTotilas, and Manfred are visitors who cannot be forgotten. The city\\nhas looked out on many battles, from the overthrow of the Molossian\\nto the overthrow of the Swabian. A pleasing tale in its history is\\nwhen that Tiberius Gracchus who is the first of a name to appear in\\nRoman history led back his victorious slave-soldiers to receive the\\nreward of freedom, and to be welcomed by the rejoicing people of the\\nfaithful colony. For among the Thirty Cities of those days, the Latin\\ncolony of Beneventum was not one of the laggard twelve, but one of\\nthe faithful eighteen that were ready to endure all hardships. In\\nlater warfare the city seems to have been less steadfast. It welcomed\\nBelisarius, and in after days Totilas took it without any trouble, and\\nif he destroyed the walls it was not out of revenge for any resistance\\non the part of its inhabitants, but for fear they should supply a post\\nof defence for an imperial army. But the greatest day of Beneventum as\\nan historical city comes later than Totilas and earlier than Manfred.\\nThe memory of that day may be studied in the chief remaining buildings\\nin the city, the two greatest churches and the castle. The west front\\nof the metropolitan church, a grand example of Italian Romanesque, is\\nfurthermore a perfect chronicle of local history. There we may read,\\nbuilt up into the wall, a crowd of monumental records of the Lombard\\nprinces of Beneventum, with their deeds, especially their dealings\\nwith the dangerous power of the Franks, set forth at length. The\\nbronze doors are famous, with their long array of Scriptural subjects\\nending in a lesson in the ecclesiastical geography of the province,\\nthe figures of the Archbishop of Beneventum and his suffragans. The\\nharmony of the front is a little marred by the single low and massive\\ncorner-tower; but the inscription sums up the history of Beneventum,\\npolitical and physical, for some ages. The city was laid waste by the\\nEmperor Frederick in 1229 and by an earthquake in 1688. The tower was\\nbuilt after the first overthrow in 1279; it was restored after the\\nsecond in 1690. Destruction wrought by the elements would thus seem\\nto be more easily repaired than destruction wrought by the hand of\\nC\\u00e6sar. But it is somewhat strange to find Frederick, in his own belief\\na successor of Trajan, a follower of Trajan in Eastern conquests,\\nbranded as a destroyer in the city where Trajan's memory is cherished.\\nBut Frederick had to deal with a kind of power which Trajan knew not.\\nThe wrath of the later Emperor fell on a city which was too faithful\\nto the Roman Bishop. The course of Trajan's rule was not likely to be\\ninterfered with either by the obscure chief of the persecuted Christian\\nsect, or by any minister of the creed of which Trajan was himself chief\\nPontiff.\\n\\nWithin the church the repairs done after the earthquake have wrought a\\ngood deal of mischief. But we can still see the four ranges of columns\\nof a mighty basilica which must once have taken its place among the\\nnoblest of its class. Their capitals are a little nondescript; but\\nthey do not offend the eye; if they were certified to be of Trajan's\\nday, it would doubtless be the right thing to admire them. The ambones\\nand the Easter-light are lovely work of the early fourteenth century,\\nthe days of a real Renaissance , truer than that which followed. The\\ntreasury is rich in vestments and other precious things; but the reader\\nof Anselm's Life looks in vain for that specially gorgeous vestment\\nwhich a Beneventan Archbishop of the eleventh century bore away from\\nCanterbury in exchange for the arm of St. Bartholomew, and which made\\nits wearer the most splendid object among the assembled fathers at\\nBari. If this missing garment carries our thoughts to England, the\\nround church of St. Sophia -- hexagonal in its inner range -- carries us\\nto the Eastern world, and reminds us that there was more than one line\\nof successors of Trajan, and that Beneventum came under the influences\\nof both. The cloister, with its amazing series of capitals, its birds,\\nits elephants, its hunting scenes, may rank with those of Aosta and of\\nArles, of which that of Aosta can supply camels to match the Beneventan\\nelephants. The castle dates only from Pope John the Twenty-second, far\\naway at Avignon; we look perhaps more carefully at the older fragments\\nbuilt up in its walls and on the lion in front of it. With the lion\\nin our thoughts we may look out for other beasts, graven or molten\\nor abiding in their own relics. Procopius saw there the tusks of the\\nKalydonian boar, as in later times he might, either at Warwick or at\\nBristol, have seen the ribs of the dun cow. It is for pal\\u00e6ontologists\\nto say what it was that the Beneventan antiquaries really showed\\nhim. Failing this natural wonder we go to pay our respects to another\\nbeast whose shape is due to man's device, in quite another part of the\\ncity. A rudely carved bovine animal, in which local patriotism sees\\nthe Samnite bull -- the bull which, on the coins of revived Samnium, so\\nproudly trampled down the Roman wolf -- is now cruelly to be ruled as\\nnothing better than a monument of intruding Apis-worship. We have less\\ntime to spend at Benevento than at some other cities; but the Roman\\narches and vaults of the strange building called Quaranta Santi ,\\nthe grand Roman bridge below, must not be forgotten, and we must still\\ngive one more thought to the two mighty men whose hopes were shattered\\nat Beneventum. Manfred fell with his faithful Saracens around him;\\nPyrrhos lived to fall by a meaner end at Argos; but Beneventum ended\\nthe real career of both. It is strange how the two were in some sort\\nthe converse of each other. Pyrrhos carried the Epeirot arms into\\nSicily and southern Italy; Manfred, lord of Sicily and southern Italy,\\nestablished a Sicilian dominion on the coast of Epeiros. Korkyra,\\nCorfu, the island which has seen every master except the Turk, formed\\npart of the dominions of both alike. We leave Benevento for another\\ncity in which the East and the West of Europe, and a crowd of other\\nelements besides, meet yet more closely than they do at Benevento.\\nAt Beneventum the eye of Horace began to be caught by the well-known\\nmountains of Apulia; Procopius somewhat boldly speaks of inland\\nBeneventum as being opposite to Dalmatia. The city which we take as\\nour next chief goal, if not strictly opposite to Dalmatia, is so marked\\nas being opposite to one Illyrian port as to have sent its name, so to\\nspeak, across the Hadriatic. We will not trouble ourselves to look out\\nfor Equotuticum, or to regale ourselves with either the bread or the\\nwater of Canusium. It is to the walls of Bari, fishy Bari, that we have\\nto make our way; at Bari, Greek, Latin, Saracen, even Englishman, are\\nall at home, and Bari is opposite to Antivari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Norman Buildings in Apulia.\\n\\n\\nAt Foggia the line of railway which crosses the Italian peninsula\\nfrom Naples eastward joins the great European line which for the most\\npart skirts the Western Hadriatic shore. From Rome itself the iter\\nad Brundisium is still made by way of Beneventum; for the great mass\\nof mankind Bologna has in this matter supplanted Beneventum and Rome\\ntoo. Our eastward course across the peninsula has done for us much the\\nsame as would be done by the like course across our own island. We have\\nundergone the same change as if we had passed from Wales, Devonshire,\\nor Cumberland, to Lincolnshire or East-Anglia. We need no longer\\nlook out for hill-cities, where the first element in such cities, the\\nhills themselves, is not to be found. At Foggia we have not even the\\namount of hill which we have at Benevento. We are in the great Apulian\\nplain, the plain so precious for sheep-feeding, and the occupation of\\nwhich has more than once given rise to wars and treaties. Of Foggia\\nitself many perhaps have never heard except as a railway junction.\\nYet Foggia has a history, and its history has monuments, though we\\ncan hardly put them on a level with the monuments and the history of\\nBeneventum. The capital of Apulia, the representative of ancient Arpi,\\nhas a history in some respects the same as that of Beneventum, in some\\nother respects its opposite. Both cities claimed Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas as a founder,\\nwhile Frederick the Second, a destroyer at Benevento, appears as a\\nlater founder at Foggia. One arch of his palace still remains, with an\\ninscription telling us how under him Foggia became a royal and Imperial\\nseat. There died his English Empress Isabel, on the splendour of whose\\npassage on her way to her marriage our own historians are eloquent.\\nFurther than this, the monumental attractions of Foggia hardly go\\nbeyond what is left of its chief church. Of its front Gsell-fels, gives\\na somewhat ideal engraving, showing it, not as it is, but as it was\\nbefore earthquakes and restorers after earthquakes had combined to mar\\nit. It was -- indeed, with all mutilations, it still is -- a fine front\\nof the later Italian Romanesque, with one of the rose or wheel windows\\nwhich we must now look for wherever we go. More attractive perhaps is\\nthe crypt, with its four columns and capitals of singular beauty. They\\nsurely belong to the time of the Imperial patron of Foggia, marking as\\nthey do a kind of earlier and more healthy Renaissance , which, taking\\nclassical form as its general models, took them only as general models,\\nand did not deem itself bound slavishly to copy every turn of a leaf\\nor every section of a moulding. Such works of the carver's tool are\\nakin to those noble coins of Frederick which seem ages in advance of\\nanything that bore the image and superscription of his grandfather.\\n\\nFoggia is however less likely to strike the traveller -- at least\\nthe traveller who comes from the hill-towns by way of Capua and\\nBenevento -- by any remarkable store of ancient monuments, than as\\nbeing the first to which he will come of a series of cities, most of\\nwhich at once impress the visitor by their air of modern progress and\\nprosperity. The heel of Italy, in its cities at least, certainly seems\\nto be the very opposite to a decaying region, or even to a region which\\nstands still. To be sure, the city whose name is the most familiar\\nof all is something of an exception; Brindisi, notwithstanding its\\ndealings with the whole world, is not as Bari or even as Trani. But\\nmost of the towns at which we tarry, or which we pass by, give quite a\\ndifferent impression. We cannot tarry at all. At Barletta we get only\\na glimpse of the Imperial colossus, and therefore we do not venture\\nto hazard a guess whether it is Heraclius or any later prince whom it\\nrepresents. Along this coast, any C\\u00e6sar of the East is in his place,\\nif only as a memorial of the long, though half forgotten, time when\\nSouthern Italy bowed to the New Rome and not to the Old. But we do\\nnot let these earlier memories wholly shut out the thought of the\\nlater combat when the Horatii and Curiatii of legend found themselves\\nmultiplied by a process exactly opposite to decimation. The attractions\\nof Trani are irresistible; a bell-tower rising as proudly over the\\nwaves as that of Spalato itself would force us to halt even if we knew\\nnothing before of what church and city has to show us. The metropolitan\\nchurch of Trani is certainly one of the very noblest examples of that\\nsingular mixture of Norman and more strictly Italian forms -- not without\\na touch both of the Greek and the Saracen -- which is the characteristic\\nstyle of this region, the natural result of its political history.\\nStrange, but striking in the extreme, is the effect of the east end\\nof this church rising close above the sea; far more truly admirable\\nis the effect of the inside, where the coupled columns of the Saracen\\nhave been boldly taught to act as the piers of the great arcades,\\nand to bear up above them a massive triforium, which by itself would\\nmake us think ourselves in Normandy or England. All the churches of\\nthis district have a good deal of their strength underground, and the\\nunder-church of Trani is worthy of the building which it supports.\\nThe smaller church, All Saints', a charming little basilica with a\\nportico of singular grace, as also several good pieces of domestic\\narchitecture, and the general effect of the tower skirted with its\\ndark arcades, all join to make Trani a place which cannot be passed\\nby, though no august form calls on us, as at Barletta, to tarry to\\npay C\\u00e6sar his due homage. But Trani has found something to be said for\\nitself both by pen and by pencil in quite other company. An accident of\\nlater times gave it a right to rank, like Brindisi itself, among the\\nSubject and Neighbour Lands of Venice. And Trani has peculiarities of\\nits own. The main features of the style may be studied elsewhere. We\\nlong to see Barletta, to tarry to pay C\\u00e6sar his due. We long to stop at\\nBisceglia and Molfetta, of which we read attractive notices; but again\\nwe must pick and choose, and Bitonto is the only place on which we can\\nqualify ourselves to speak at all at large, till we come to the head of\\nthe whole region at Bari.\\n\\nBitonto shares a station with San Spirito, but it lies further away\\nfrom the railway, and that on the inland side, than most of the towns\\nalong this line. Its main interest is found in its cathedral church,\\nwhich in some points prepares us for the buildings of Bari. First\\nof all in point of wonder, though latest in point of date, is the\\ntreatment which it has undergone at the hands of modern improvers.\\nA dim remembrance comes to us that we saw something of the same kind\\nin the Dominican church at Perugia; otherwise we ask in amazement why\\nany man should think it an improvement to cut off the whole upper part\\nof a church as seen inside by thrusting in a roof a great deal lower\\nthan the original one, and thereby leaving the upper stages outside\\nto stand up in the air, serving no kind of purpose. Yet this has been\\ndone both at Bitonto and at Bari. Yet perchance the improvers of modern\\ntimes might retort on the original architects, and ask why, when they\\nhad made three apses at the east end, they presently built up a wall\\nto hide them. This is the arrangement both at Bitonto and in the two\\ngreat churches of Bari. The notion of Normans working in Italy would\\nalmost seem to have been to make an Italian front at one end, and\\nsomething approaching to a Norman front at the other end. Thus the\\nchurch of Bitonto has an excellent west front of Italian outline, with\\ndetails more Italian than Norman, and with the characteristic round\\nwindow evidently designed from the beginning, though the one which is\\nactually there must be of later date. Also there either has been or has\\nbeen meant to be a portico over the lower stage of the west front, a\\nthoroughly Italian notion. But the east end takes almost the form of\\na Norman west front; a Norman founder, it would seem, was not happy\\nunless he could somewhere or other get two towers with an ornamental\\nwall between them. To this end the apses are sacrificed. Instead of\\nthe three curved projections which form the main features of so many\\nItalian, German, and indeed Norman, east ends, the whole east end is\\nflat. The side apses are disguised by towers, one only of which is\\ncarried up to any height, while the great apse is hidden by the wall\\nbetween the towers. Herein is the difference between Bitonto and Trani.\\nAt Trani there are no eastern towers, and the apses, though of amazing\\nexternal height and no less amazing slightness of projection, are still\\nreal apses with a real curve. At Bitonto no one could know from the\\noutside that there were any apses at all. As the ordinary ranges of\\narcades and windows are thus made impossible, the architect, like an\\nEnglish architect some generations later, threw his strength into a\\nsingle east window, and certainly made one as large and as rich as was\\npossible before the invention of tracery. An elaborate round-headed\\nopening is covered with rich devices, and has wonderful monsters to\\nbear up its side-shafts. This too is to be seen at Trani, and we shall\\ncome again to other examples at Bari. There is something very strange\\nin these attempts to reconcile the ideas of Normandy and of Italy in\\none building. But in these flat east ends the result is that we get\\nsomething which is certainly neither Italian nor Norman, and which can\\nhardly be approved according to any law of either reality or beauty.\\n\\nThe same spirit of compromise goes on in other parts. The endless\\ncolumns of the under-church supply a rich study of capitals, largely of\\nthe grotesque kind. Men, monkeys, the original ram's horn, leaves, the\\nImperial eagle -- better suited for the purpose than anything else -- all\\ndo duty as volutes. The columns in the upper-church too give another\\nrich collection of various kinds of human, animal, and vegetable forms.\\nBut here a soberer spirit reigns; though perhaps no one capital is\\nstrictly classical, yet the grotesque does not reign as it does below.\\nThree arches from columns, a solid block, three more arches from\\ncolumns, make up the nave. Over these Italian elements Norman taste\\nset a triforium; modern taste has hidden the clerestory. Outside, the\\nItalian has his way in the rich open arcades of the parapets and in\\nthe windows of various forms, filled, some of them, with that kind of\\npierced tracery which is neither Italian nor Norman, but distinctively\\nOriental, and which look as if they had come -- as they possibly may have\\ncome -- from a mosque.\\n\\nAltogether there is something singularly interesting in this mixture of\\nstyles -- more strictly this mixture of two varieties of the same style,\\nfor Italian and Norman Romanesque are after all members of one great\\nartistic family. Nothing of the kind happened in Sicily, where the\\nNorman kings simply set native craftsmen, Greek and Saracen, to build\\nfor them after their several native fashions. Here, in a land where\\nGreek and Latin elements were striving for mastery, where the Saracen\\nwas a mere occasional visitor, the Norman brought in the ideas of his\\nown land to make a new element. But, if nothing like this happened in\\nSicily, something a little like it did happen in England. There is no\\ndoubt that Norman architecture was influenced, though very slightly,\\nby the earlier native style of England, a rude imitation of Italian\\nmodels. That Norman architecture in Apulia should be far more deeply\\ninfluenced by the Italian models themselves was but carrying out the\\nsame general process, as was only natural, in a far greater degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Bari.\\n\\n\\nWe are now at Barium, Bari, the original Bari of the West, as\\ndistinguished from the Bari, Bar , Antibaris , Antivari , which\\nrepeats its name on the opposite coast. There we can now again, as we\\ncould have done seventy years back at Cattaro, land at a Montenegrin\\nhaven. The distinction between the two bearers of the name of Bari\\nimplies an association which is not out of place. The historic interest\\nof Bari gathers wholly round its connexion with the lands on the\\nother side of Hadria. In earlier days the place has really no history\\nwhatever. Its most memorable day was when the powers of the Eastern\\nand Western Empires -- powers which perhaps never again worked in such\\nharmony -- were needed to dislodge a Saracen Sultan from its walls.\\n\\\"Emir,\\\" some one will say, not \\\"Sultan,\\\" and certainly we are more\\nused in Europe to Sultans of much later date than the days of Lewis\\nthe Second and Basil the First, Sultans coming from quite other lands\\nthan any that can have sent forth the Mussulman prince of Bari. But\\nhe is called Sultan as well as Emir by his one biographer, the Emperor\\nConstantine, and we cannot appeal from those august pages which still\\nform the best guide-book to the eastern shores of the Hadriatic.\\nAnyhow, the Sultan of Bari was a philosopher; he never laughed, except\\nonce when he saw a wheel go round; for that reminded him of the ups and\\ndowns of his own fortunes. Then Bari passes to the rule of the Eastern\\nEmpire; instead of a Sultan it has a Katapan, representative of the\\nEastern Augustus in that Italian dominion which had become so small\\nat the beginning of the ninth century, and which was so great again at\\nits end. Threatened again at the beginning of the eleventh century by\\nnew Saracen invaders, it is guarded by the fleets of Venice, still the\\nfaithful vassal of Constantinople against a common enemy. Seventy years\\nlater the arms of Robert Wiscard added the capital of Byzantine Italy\\nto his Norman dominion, and before the century was out, Pope Urban, the\\ngreat stirrer of the West against the Mussulman East, chose Bari as the\\nscene of the Council called to denounce at once the practical abuses of\\nthe Christian West and the dogmatic errors of the Christian East. Once\\nmore, in the next age, we find Bari looking across the sea to its old\\nlord, and chastised by the Sicilian king for its disloyalty. Add that\\nBari, before all saints, still honours St. Nicolas of the Lykian Myra,\\nand keeps his relics sacred, we are told, from Turkish desecration\\nby the craft of merchants of her own city. Altogether Bari seems, at\\nleast in its history, as much Greek as Italian or Norman. It would seem\\nneither unnatural nor unpleasant if Greek were still the tongue of the\\nseafaring folk of Bari, much as a Norman in his own land often carries\\nan air about him which would make Danish seem a much more natural\\nspeech for him than French.\\n\\nBut the great buildings of Bari belong to that mixed Norman and\\nItalian style of which we have already seen something at Bitonto. The\\narchitectural attractions of the city are chiefly to be found in two\\ngreat churches and one smaller one. The castle, standing by the sea,\\nshould have its landward side walked round, and the walk will reveal\\nmuch of picturesque outline and a little of good detail. But it is\\nthe churches, above all the great abbey of St. Nicolas, which are the\\nglory of Bari. They all lie in the old town by the sea, the old town\\nof narrow and crooked streets, in which it does not much matter which\\nway you go; you are sure to come either to the castle or to one of the\\nchurches before very long. Very different are things in the new town,\\nwhich we may rejoice in as we look at it as a sign of Bari's abiding\\nor renewed prosperity, but which can raise no feelings of pleasure on\\nany other ground. Its streets, crossing each other at right angles, are\\nindeed carefully dedicated to the worthies of Bari; but, unless we can\\nalways remember which of several perhaps not very familiar worthies\\nwatches over each of several angles which are exactly alike, it is\\neasy to take a wrong turn and to put oneself under the care of Andrew\\nof Bari when we ought rather to be commending ourselves to Robert.\\nAnd under either protection we yearn in the wide straight streets\\nfor some physical shelter from the Apulian sun, and wonder why modern\\nRome, modern Athens, and modern Bari should have so much less common\\nsense than Bologna, Padua, and Corfu had in days long past. Still,\\namid this rectangular labyrinth the sea is a help on one side, while\\non another the tall tower of the metropolitan church of St. Sabinus\\nbeckons us into the older streets, whose narrowness and crookedness\\nat least supply shade. That tower, one of the tallest and stateliest\\nof Italy, we naturally assume to be a detached campanile, without a\\nfellow and standing apart from its confederate buildings, church and\\nbaptistery. So it doubtless would be in a purely Italian city; but\\nhere we are in the city where the Norman displaced the Greek. The\\ntwo great churches of Bari, like that of Bitonto, have their towers\\nwrought into the building in Norman fashion, and at the duomo the\\ngreat round baptistery is also merged in the same mass with the church\\nand its towers. Both of the great churches of Bari have east ends\\nof the same kind as that at Bitonto; the apses are swallowed up; the\\nplace where the great apse should be is marked by a single splendid\\nRomanesque window. The eastern towers of St. Nicolas have never been\\ncarried up; at St. Sabinus the southern one has perished, but the\\nnorthern one still soars in all its majesty, thoroughly Italian in its\\nconception, but rather to be called Norman in its detail. St. Nicolas\\nhas also another pair of unfinished towers at its west end, standing\\nat once beyond the aisles as at Wells and Rouen, and in front of them\\nas at Holyrood. They flank a grand Italian front which one would think\\nwould be finer without them. These western towers are absent in the\\nmetropolitan church; but that has a most perfect octagonal cupola\\nover the crossing, the grouping of which with the two lofty eastern\\ntowers, if there was any point from which it could really be seen,\\nmust have been wonderful. Thus, in both churches, something of a German\\noutline has either been consciously brought in or has been incidentally\\nstumbled on. The four towers of St. Nicolas, the octagon and eastern\\ntower of St. Sabinus, will easily find Rhenish fellows, though we\\nshould perhaps have to go as far as Angoul\\u00eame for a single tower of\\nequal majesty mourning over a vanished brother. In other points the\\nexternal arrangements of the two great churches of Bari have much\\nin common. The rose windows, the coupled windows, the blank arcades,\\nare much the same in both. So is the choice of animal forms for the\\nfanciful supports of columns. In most places the lion discharges that\\nfunction -- in a building designed by lions we should doubtless see\\nsomething different. So we do here at Bari, where the solid forms of\\nthe pachydermata are, perhaps discreetly, preferred to the lighter\\n carnivora . The elephant, we think, is to be found in both churches,\\nand the huge earth-shaking beast is represented so as to remind us both\\nof Pyrrhos and of Hannibal; some have the smaller ear of India, some\\nthe larger of Africa. The hippopotamus appears only in the west front\\nof St. Nicolas. Had the daring shipfolk who bore away the saint's bones\\nfrom Lykia made their way to the Nile also?\\n\\nWhen we pass the threshold of the two buildings we see that their fate\\nin modern times has been very different. St. Sabinus has suffered much\\nas Bitonto has suffered. The upper part of the building is hidden\\nin just the same fashion, and ugly tricks have been played with the\\ncolumns and their capitals. St. Nicolas, on the other hand, has been\\nleft comparatively alone. The chief changes which it has undergone\\nmust have taken place not very long after the original building. The\\noriginal plan was much the same as that of Bitonto -- three arches from\\ncolumns, a massive pier, then three more arches from columns. But this\\narrangement was disturbed at an early time by throwing three spanning\\narches across the nave. The effect is so striking that we can hardly\\nregret their presence; but it is perfectly easy to see that they are\\ninsertions, and, though they are essentially of the same style, yet\\nthey differ in their details from the original columns. These last all\\napproach more or less to the Corinthian type; in the under-church the\\npatterns are more varied. Here are still the wonder-working relics of\\nSt. Nicolas, and the balsam or \\\"manna\\\" which flows from them may still\\nbe drunk. In the duomo the under-church has been restored out of all\\nancient character, but it still keeps an ancient Byzantine picture.\\n\\nAs so often happens, the secondary church of Bari altogether surpassed\\nthe mother church in historic fame and local honour. To ourselves the\\nfact in its history which comes home most nearly is that it was here\\nthat Urban held his Council, here that Anselm, to the satisfaction\\nof all Western minds, refuted the creed of the East, here that he\\ninterceded with the Pontiff and the assembled fathers on behalf of the\\nking who had wronged him. Here too it was that the keen eye of English\\nEadmer spied out on the shoulders of the Archbishop of Beneventum the\\nsplendid cope which is no longer to be seen at Beneventum. Such little\\ntouches in those days often brought the ends of the world together\\nin a way to which, in our days of more general intercourse, nothing\\nanswers. When French was the polite language alike at Dunfermline and\\nat Jerusalem, when the Latin-speaking clerk was at home in any corner\\nof the West, when the few men of the West who had learned Greek spoke\\nit so that a Greek could understand them, when men passed to and fro\\nbetween the civil services of England and Sicily, communication between\\ndistant parts of Europe was in some ways easier than it is now. Bari,\\none of the chief places for setting out on crusades, must for a long\\ntime have been a thoroughly cosmopolitan city. We do feel that the ends\\nof the earth have combined to meet at Bari, when we find the place\\nof honour in the church of St. Nicolas at Bari held by a princess of\\nBari, who became Queen of the greatest Slavonic kingdom. Emblematic\\nfigures of Bari and Poland support the tomb of Queen Bona, and her\\nepitaph describes her husband Sigismund, the first of that name, as not\\nonly the mighty King of Poland, but Grand-Duke of Lithuania, Russia,\\nPrussia, Mazovia, and Samogitia. Yet we might have lighted on Slavonic\\nassociations earlier on the road. There is a strange record of a\\nBulgarian settlement in the parts of Beneventum; but that would take us\\nyet further afield: it was before Bulgarians became Slavonic. But what\\nare we to say to the Samnite Schiavia which sheltered Anselm?\\n\\nThe journey is done -- \\n\\n\\\"Brundisium long\\u00e6 finis cart\\u00e6que vi\\u00e6que.\\\"\\n\\nOtranto lies yet further; but Otranto, yet more notably than Bari,\\ncomes within the Venetian Notitia . So does Brundisium, city of the\\nstag's horn, of the haven so aptly called, if we only knew in what\\ntongue it is that Brentesium has that meaning. But we are tempted\\nto regret that Brindisi and not Otranto is the point for which Hadria\\nhas to be crossed. Brindisi has no moral claim. We cannot look thence,\\nas we can from Otranto, upon the mountains of still enslaved Epeiros;\\nno one is tempted even to dream that he looks on free Corfu or on the\\nlesser satellite that stands in front as its outpost.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"But if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NER_results\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best.
