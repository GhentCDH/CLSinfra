        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing (NLP), offering powerful capabilities in tasks like information extraction (IE) from historical texts. Chat-based generative models completely change the way we can interact with and analyse our corpora. These models enable users to engage with training data using natural language, revolutionizing communication paradigms and propagating a wide adoption of AI-tools across text-based tasks. However, concerns about **data privacy**, and **access** have arisen due to the dominance of closed-source models from industry giants like OpenAI and Google. To address these issues, there's a growing interest in open-source alternatives, which provide transparency and control over models and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook explores the potential of open-source LLMs for NER and aspect recognition in historical texts. We'll showcase zero- and few-shot learning to overcome **data scarcity**, a pivotal problem in applying IE in literary-historical contexts. We aim to showcase how open-source LLMs can illuminate the past and shape the future of historical scholarship!\n",

Freeman\\nPublisher: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS\\nPlace of publication: New York / London\\nDate: 1893\\n\\nArezzo.\\n\\n\\nThe city of M\\u00e6cenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,\\nshows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There\\nis some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,\\nand, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief\\nbuildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be\\nbought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among\\nthem surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that\\nclear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with\\nnourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different\\nways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having\\nyet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if\\nthe city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the\\nfirst rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both\\nforms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of\\nPisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect\\nof the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim\\na day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from\\nFlorence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.\\n\\nArezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities\\nwhich sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,\\nlike Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.\\nIt has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which\\npresently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself\\nin the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have\\nto be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect\\nof the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we\\ninstinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as\\na whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs\\nsome of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem\\nto borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it\\nwere covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several\\nsmall hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all\\nsides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast\\nsnowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the\\ncharacter of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a\\ngood deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a\\ngeneral view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to\\nthe left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must\\nclimb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean\\nfortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has\\ngardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about\\nat large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in\\nthe general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line\\nof the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except\\nwhere they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;\\nsurely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this\\nobject. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly\\ntheir whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit\\nit is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest\\nin some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show\\nside. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern\\nrailway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually\\ndescending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the\\ninhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from\\nopen fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it\\nis with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral\\nand the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without\\ntaking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of\\nArezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give\\nus either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of\\nmedi\\u00e6val towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect\\nin Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription\\nwhich illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed\\nsovereign Cosmo appears as \\\"Duke of Florence and Siena.\\\" He had\\ninherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;\\nmeanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the\\nhigher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\n\\nIn the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one\\ndominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral\\nchurch, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the\\ntown, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the duomo \\nis the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant\\nfeature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises\\namong a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of\\nthem, the great campanile of St. Mary della Pieve , though the body\\nof its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to\\nthe cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not\\nungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest\\narchitectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show\\nitself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and\\nthe town-tower, and that hard by the duomo ; but they do not hold,\\neven comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows\\nin the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a\\ncity which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical\\ncharacter was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of\\nArezzo, keeps -- though not on its old site -- his splendid tomb in the\\n duomo , on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles\\nwhich he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown\\nat his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of\\nhouses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building\\nbesides the churches is the front of that called the Fraternit\\u00e0 dei\\nLaici , in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of\\nArretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,\\nbut so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,\\nit contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show\\nin many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are\\nthe huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other\\nvast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.\\nNaturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones\\nwere no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as\\nrelics of the G\\u00e6tulian beasts of Hannibal.\\n\\nSomething may be picked up here and there in the other churches of\\nArezzo; but it is Santa Maria della Pieve which is the real object\\nof study. The duomo is absolutely without outline; it is a single\\nbody with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.\\nBut its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than\\nis common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the\\nGerman hand to which tradition attributes the building. The church of\\n La Pieve is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.\\nIts four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been\\nfinished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;\\nthe west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor\\nits defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which\\nnothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at\\nLucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column\\ncapitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its\\nlowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.\\nThe arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so\\nthey are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium\\nshows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The\\narches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well\\nas those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of\\nprodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is\\nquite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;\\nthe arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The\\nsouth side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:\\nbut it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient\\nbuilding on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the\\nwest front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished\\nfrom Arezzo. The \\\"Tyrrhena regum progenies\\\" have here left but small\\ntraces behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCortona.\\n\\n\\nFrom Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height\\n\\n ... Cortona lifts to heaven\\n Her diadem of towers.\\n\\nIf the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the\\nwalls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,\\nsuggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their\\nrace, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not\\nwin victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer\\nseems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with\\nClitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The\\njourney is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we\\nmight well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione\\nFiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern\\nhill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers\\na hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione\\ndistinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height\\nwhich it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.\\nWe have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the\\nheight, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and\\nCorinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of\\nthe younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,\\nas at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has\\nnever come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has\\nbecome at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas\\nis forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of\\nthe ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a\\ncity like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \\\"diadem\\nof towers\\\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of\\ntowers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any\\naccount in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make\\nup an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,\\nthere is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well\\nforsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the\\nplain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city\\nitself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it\\nthat we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site\\nitself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world\\nthat there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main\\ninterest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased\\nthat everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and\\nthat the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the\\nEtruscan walls.\\n\\nIn truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that\\nCortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had\\nfound only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which\\nlater times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost\\namong the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been\\ngreat in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little\\naccount that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the\\nground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just\\nat that time came its short period of anything like importance among\\nthe cities of medi\\u00e6val Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth\\ncentury, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.\\nYet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though\\nwe can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a\\ncity, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the\\nyounger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional\\nvisitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;\\nanother persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the\\nancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona\\nis emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own\\ncompany.\\n\\nAs an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,\\nthrough the regular stages of Roman colony and medi\\u00e6val commonwealth,\\nCortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of\\nits being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing\\nthat can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and\\nmonasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some\\ncontain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps\\nmarks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that\\nits cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.\\nThe duomo stands about half-way up the height within the town, on\\na corner of the walls. Its elegant Renaissance interior has been\\nalready spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building\\nthe columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper\\ncity where we should have looked for the duomo is occupied by the\\nChurch of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over\\nher portal as \\\"p\\u0153nitens Margarita,\\\" marked off thereby alike from\\nthe virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal\\nbuildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio\\nmust be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly\\ncoated as it is with the arms of successive podestas . Of private\\npalaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not\\non its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.\\nFrom the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the\\nacropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.\\nThe Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins -- not an\\nusual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its\\nditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed\\nfabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which\\nthe visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local\\nimportunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points\\nof view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done\\nfirst of all -- that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing\\nthat makes Cortona what it is.\\n\\nThe process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in\\nsome measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.\\nHappily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in\\nby far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan\\nrampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no\\nsmall height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,\\nbut still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood\\nin the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is\\nreason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must\\nremember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the\\ndays of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman\\nworks. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the\\none remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might\\nalmost have stood at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. On the highest point, the hindermost\\npoint, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside\\nan inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,\\nthe Etruscan wall has largely given way to the medi\\u00e6val fortress whose\\npresent aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only\\nto leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an\\noutpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of\\nthe whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seemingh\\nto stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the\\nhistory of Cortona in stone and brick.\\n\\nFrom the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and\\nthe other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,\\nthe glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chim\\u00e6ra is the glory\\nof the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought\\nwith endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a\\nfemale head, which we might at first take for the work of Renaissance \\nhands, and in which those who are skilled in such matters profess to\\nrecognize the existing type of Cortonese beauty. The painting however\\ndates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps\\nher ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their\\nskulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her\\npresent people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features\\nwere copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living\\ncountenance of one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerugia.\\n\\n\\nThe hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of medi\\u00e6val Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmedi\\u00e6val and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch's \\\"Life of Timole\\u00f4n,\\\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr\\u00e6historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.\\n\\nThe difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the\\nabiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical\\ndifference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if\\nwe will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of\\nPerugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona\\nsits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but\\non a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several -- possibly\\nseven -- outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.\\nThe Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of\\na very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and\\noutlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is\\nonly in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain\\nthe present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that\\nwe can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly\\na hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,\\nwhile the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.\\nBut Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the\\nplain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it\\nhas happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona\\nis not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long\\nperiod of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all\\nthe way from its railway station to its municipal palace.\\n\\nAt Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws\\nto itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\\n\\nPerugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as\\nreceptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked\\non. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At\\nthe two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on\\nthe Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.\\nAngelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long\\nseries of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to\\nLudlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with\\nits beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one\\nof the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other\\nend, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble\\nranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building\\nat its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the duomo \\nitself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it\\nshows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and\\nits pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not\\nchurches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from\\nother things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one\\nclass alone -- Augusta Perusia itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Volumnian Tomb.\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern\\nFreemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the\\nouter world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have\\nread various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,\\nits constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us\\nthe fullest particulars: we have only to complain that the historical\\npart is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should\\nnot like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient\\nin the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty\\nany further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact\\nduties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we\\nshould answer, not \\\"Amen,\\\" but \\\"So mote it be.\\\" Still, what Freemasonry\\nis, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a\\nFreemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books\\nleave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to\\nknow everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can\\nknow a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom\\nwe seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as\\nto the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,\\nand belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their\\nbuildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they\\nlived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan\\nbooks; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless\\ninscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language\\nwas, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,\\nhalf-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as\\nthe mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here\\nand there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one\\ningenious man has read it all into good German and another into good\\nTurkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like\\na Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything\\nin three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light\\non a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For\\nsurely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead\\nletter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,\\nbut at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.\\n\\nIt is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments\\nof a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part\\nof the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the\\ncollections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if\\nwe are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or\\nshall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly\\nEtruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes\\nlargely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this\\nmust specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have\\nleft no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly\\nfair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like\\nthe Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But\\nsuppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have\\nin the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek\\nor Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral\\nelement would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly\\ndominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be\\nso distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.\\nTake a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does\\nnot of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference\\nto the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven\\non the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in\\nthe Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye\\nand the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than\\neven the chim\\u00e6ra, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various\\nsizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.\\nThe departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the\\nuninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance\\nto divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is\\ndesigned to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the\\n Lucumonissa -- if we may coin so medi\\u00e6val a form -- lies apart, sometimes\\nalong with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to\\nbring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious\\nrace than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.\\n\\nBut if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\\n\\nWe are not describing at length what may be found described at length\\nelsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures\\nwhich gives them a strange and special interest. This is their\\nstrangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but\\nso are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch\\nof Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo\\nreclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly medi\\u00e6val recumbent\\nfigure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,\\nsay in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures\\non the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give\\nus living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the\\nRasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient\\nworks which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.\\nAnd nowhere do the sculptures look fresher -- almost modern -- than when\\nseen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the\\nsepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi.\\n\\n\\nThere is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of\\nmischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite\\ndifferent from that which makes the place famous with the world in\\ngeneral. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious\\nerror. When so many members of Parliament showed a few years back,\\nand when the Times showed only a very little time back, that they\\nbelieved that the University of Oxford was founded by somebody -- Alfred\\nwill do as well as anybody else -- and that the city of Oxford somehow\\ngrew up around the University, it became, and it remains, a duty to\\nhistoric truth to point out the importance of Oxford, geographical and\\ntherefore political and military, for some ages before the University\\nwas heard of. When the Times thought that Oxford was left to the\\nscholars, because \\\"thanes and barons\\\" did not think it worth struggling\\nfor, the Times clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford\\nthen, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because\\nOxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,\\nflourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat\\nof councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;\\nin other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,\\nwhile the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly\\nworthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects\\nwhich are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible\\nthat some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the\\nchurch and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the\\nerror is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the\\ncity of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis\\nand his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and\\nworld-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully\\nworthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on\\nages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place\\nwell worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and\\nthough his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light\\nmatter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very\\nunlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before\\nhim and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace\\nof the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called\\n\\\"seraphica civitas,\\\" before one of its later churches came to rank with\\nthe patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early\\nmedi\\u00e6val city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still\\nexist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a\\nkind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The\\nsaint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could\\nhe have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,\\nand doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow\\nstream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral\\nchurch of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the\\nGreat Twin Brethren.\\n\\nAssisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless\\nvarieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which\\nwe have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on\\nwhich it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge\\nmountain. As at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea, while the akropolis is high enough, there is\\nsomething far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis\\nof Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of\\nshelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The duomo \\nstands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top\\nof the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is\\nno small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the\\nremains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond\\nit, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling\\nof man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost\\nmore needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not\\nonly for the medi\\u00e6val walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark\\nan outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow\\nvalley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at\\ntheir feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the\\nglimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only\\nless wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb\\nfrom the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but\\nthere the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes\\nall the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,\\ngives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure\\nto the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a\\ncity running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of\\nbell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general\\neffect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,\\ncrowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except\\nthe steep of the mountain itself.\\n\\nOf particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a\\nrestriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,\\nSaint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest\\ninterest is the temple in the forum -- now Piazza grande -- with its\\nCorinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on\\nthe other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned\\ninto a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple\\nof Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting\\npart of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at\\nAssisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple\\nmust have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper\\nones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,\\nwith the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on\\nthe Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those\\ncomments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient\\nJewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the\\nsynagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is\\nthe dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,\\nand the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates\\nand people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great\\ncollection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it\\ndown quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the\\ndedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number\\nof inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,\\nthere are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best\\nworth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and\\noculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of\\nthe Sexviri for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,\\nand left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly\\nbrought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his\\ncoachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are\\nset thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of\\nforeign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and\\non the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements\\nwere practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of\\nAssisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less\\ngood a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.\\n\\nThe temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most\\nmemorable things in Pr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things\\nbesides, both Roman and medi\\u00e6val. The lower church of Sta. Maria\\nMaggiore , close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been\\nthe original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German\\nlook, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into\\nthe mind that it is the cella of a temple with arches cut through\\nits walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local\\nfashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter\\nhard by. Besides, at Sta. Maria Maggiore there are the clear remains\\nof a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,\\nunderneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has\\nbeen sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth\\ncentury, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,\\nand it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the\\ncrypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,\\nand Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above\\nare scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier\\nremains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the\\nsurrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman chester \\nabide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is\\nmodern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the Via San Paolo \\nleading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above\\nground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many\\nmemorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in\\nclimbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while\\nboth Saint Francis and Saint Clara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpello.\\n\\n\\nThe Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many\\ngates its full description as \\\"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia\\nCostante,\\\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum\\nor as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most\\nlikely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in\\none of its churches. Somebody must come to see them, or their keepers\\nwould not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them\\ncovered, in hopes of earning a lira by uncovering them. May we make\\nthe confession that we became aware -- or, to speak more delicately,\\nthat we were reminded -- of the existence of the colony at once Julian\\nand Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German\\nguide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel\\nthoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,\\nyet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and\\nthat, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman\\nmonuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more\\nperfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the\\nwonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we\\nshould hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;\\nbut a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is\\nno one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but\\nthere are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some\\nimportance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the\\nplace, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as\\nSpello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less\\nuntouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.\\nWe except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the medi\\u00e6val\\nhouses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.\\nBut that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong\\nin some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at\\nSpello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to\\nseize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the\\nfinest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains\\nand ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,\\nand the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers\\nand cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The medi\\u00e6val walls and towers,\\nat all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not\\neasily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the\\nantiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in\\nmere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps\\na little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not\\ndisappointing.\\n\\nAt Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;\\neven in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one\\nhand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no duomo , nor is\\nthere any other church of much architectural importance. The best are\\ntwo small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each\\nside of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building\\nof a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group\\nlying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There\\nis a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;\\nby its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the\\namphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with\\nits marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre\\nis down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the\\npresent city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original\\nRoman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever\\nthe influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed\\nwith so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from\\nSpello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments\\nwhich are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the\\nbuilding is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of\\nits bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;\\nother fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when\\nwe reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it\\nis its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.\\n\\nAs we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia\\nConstans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which\\nbears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the\\nconsular gate is reached only through a medi\\u00e6val one, which bears, as\\nwe have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the\\nstranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:\\nfor Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty\\nof climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in\\ncontinuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been\\npatched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single\\nsimple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to\\nthe lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,\\nknown as Porta Veneris , must have been a far more elaborate design.\\nBut the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double\\nentrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet\\nthere is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal\\ntowers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,\\nhigher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch\\nhanging in the air. This is locally known as the arco di trionfo . Of\\nthe arco di Augusto within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of\\nMacrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman\\nremains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and\\nfragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them\\nout. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival\\nVerona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain\\nperverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what\\nhas been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the\\nend of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match\\nthe mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one\\njourney. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to\\nspend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must\\nhurry on to aurea Roma herself, even though we have to rush by many a\\ntown and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest\\nof all, by\\n\\n ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,\\n The fortress of Nequinum lowers\\n O'er the pale waves of Nar.\\n\\nMarry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,\\npresents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to\\nhave come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the\\nRoman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Qu\\u00e6stor Bacchus -- it\\nis taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot\\nhelp Latinizing the Questore Bacco -- puts out another set of placards\\nto forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among\\nour memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a\\nsecession; we might almost expect to see once more\\n\\n ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.\\n\\nBut those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede\\neven to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the Sala\\nDante .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeii.\\n\\n\\nThe student of what M. Amp\\u00e8re calls \\\"L'Histoire Romaine \\u00e0 Rome\\\" must\\ntake care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history\\nof Rome -- and the local history of Rome is no small part of the\\n\\u0153cumenical history -- is not fully understood unless we fully take in\\nthe history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.\\nWith Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and\\nher allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made\\npart of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And\\nfirst on the list may well come the city which was before all others\\nthe rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of\\ndestruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through\\na country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with\\nthe heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has\\nutterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left\\nwithin the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we\\nare close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by\\na rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,\\nan inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the\\nfirst great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'\\nsiege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the\\nHellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such\\nas are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of\\nliving things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria\\nnothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some\\nconvulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,\\nand tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a\\nrace with whom death counted for more than life.\\n\\nA sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand\\nsome points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival\\nof Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,\\nwe understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the\\nhatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked\\non the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange\\na greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the\\ngreat border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate\\nneighbours which could contend with her on equal terms. Elsewhere, in\\nher early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace\\nor war with whole confederations.\\n\\nThe happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky\\ngroup of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great\\nas all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what\\nclearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And\\nwhen the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the\\ncharacter of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,\\nit is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city\\nwhich had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the\\nstage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing\\nRome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome\\nwould be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near\\ntogether could not go on together. Two cities, very great according\\nto the standard of those times, considerable according even to a\\nmodern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and\\neverything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the\\nmodern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours\\non its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and\\ndinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt\\nall the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while\\nRome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of\\nher dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,\\nconfederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come\\nsooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.\\n\\nThe site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city\\nmade, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing\\nlike the \\\"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\\\" Veii is\\nnot a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,\\nyet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above\\nthe steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the\\nfateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a\\ntable-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an\\nadmirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by\\nthe walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid\\nout on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as\\nin so many cases, the arx , a peninsula within a peninsula, was the\\noriginal city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,\\nit would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii\\ntook a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual\\ngrowth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted\\nextent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a\\ncity which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not\\nspread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the\\noccupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed\\nan old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber\\nbelow their walls.\\n\\nIt is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and\\nextent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which\\ncan be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in\\nthe circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring -- the Ponte\\nSodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.\\nBesides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs\\nof a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after\\ntimes arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains\\nof the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.\\nThere is the Roman columbarium , within the Etruscan site; there\\nare the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There\\nis, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures\\nand inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian\\nsepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment\\nto see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the\\nunaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the\\narms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive\\nform and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no\\nwritten \\u00e6nigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by\\nmarking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage\\nby far than the roof of Rome's Tullianum or its fellow at Tusculum.\\nIn the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it\\nbelongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from\\nEtruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes\\nfrom the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman\\nhistory, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think\\nit. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know\\nthat, except the palpable remains of the Roman municipium , nothing\\ncan be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.\\nIn the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by\\nconquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early\\nstage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same\\ndate, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;\\nthe only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and\\nhalf-Hellenic Macedonia.\\n\\nWe turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how\\nutterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman\\nhistory. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,\\ninasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.\\nBut that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in\\nRome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has\\nstretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be -- all this\\nwe understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of\\nLivy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiden\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nFrom the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the arx of\\nFiden\\u00e6 as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel\\nGiubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence\\nof Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other\\nthings sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to\\nhave been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems\\ndesigned as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter\\nof fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan\\noutpost on Latin soil. Whether Fiden\\u00e6 was really such an outpost in the\\nstrict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion\\nof the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was\\na Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the\\nEtruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally\\nof Veii, that Fiden\\u00e6 made itself memorable. If we accept the received\\nstory, the war which brought about the ruin of Fiden\\u00e6 was caused\\nbecause its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,\\nperhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus\\ntook so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,\\nand the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus\\nformed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We\\nmay believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least\\nwere real, if the witness of Augustus C\\u00e6sar is to be believed.\\n\\nEach of the roads which lead out of Rome -- since the railway came,\\nthere is practically only one way which leads into Rome -- has its own\\nspecial interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to\\nthe Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in\\nits material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations\\nis perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian\\ngate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing\\nto itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall\\nof Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by\\nthe Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in\\nthe new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline\\ngate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of\\nRome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of\\ndefence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome\\nmarched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to\\nput down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after\\nthe slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those\\nwho did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.\\nBefore the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the\\ndominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.\\nAnd when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the\\nnew entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that\\nher political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral\\ndominion was stronger than ever. \\\"At midnight the Salarian gate was\\nsilently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous\\nsound of the Gothic trumpet.\\\" And if these gates were a centre of\\nfighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of\\nburying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs\\nhere and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but\\nthis quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials\\nwhich is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline gate was the\\nliving tomb of unchaste vestals; not far beyond the Salarian we come\\nto the Christian c\\u0153meterium Priscillae . We go on; we descend the\\nhill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the\\nalluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting\\nof the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might\\nseem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived\\nand gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken\\ndown and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those\\nof Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but\\nif we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must\\nhave been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly\\nnew when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come\\nto another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a medi\\u00e6val\\ntower; the medi\\u00e6val tower now proclaims itself as an \\\"osteria\\\"; but\\nwe feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now\\nfairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills\\nbeyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills\\nof Fiden\\u00e6 are before us. To the right lies the ground between the\\nSalarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his\\nmaster Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the\\nrailway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with\\nTiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between\\nhills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a\\nrange of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to\\nthe right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fiden\\u00e6, in the pass which\\ndivides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on\\nthe inland side.\\n\\nThe arx of Fiden\\u00e6, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,\\na height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer\\nto them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river\\nleaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that\\nside rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city\\ncould look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of\\nthe small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,\\nthe Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii\\nitself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the arx \\nof Fiden\\u00e6 and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.\\nInland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when\\nFiden\\u00e6 was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place\\nagainst the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the\\nrest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original\\n arx . We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its\\n cloaca , the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley\\nby the brook between the lower hill of Fiden\\u00e6 and the hill which lies\\nbetween Fiden\\u00e6 and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It\\nwas no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground\\nas the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand\\nwhy Rome on the first opportunity swept Fiden\\u00e6 utterly away, while the\\nexistence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.\\n\\nAs at Veii, so at Fiden\\u00e6, the traces of the living are gone -- yet more\\nutterly at Fiden\\u00e6 than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more\\nplentiful, though Fiden\\u00e6 has nothing to set against the painted tomb of\\nVeii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won\\nthe spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fiden\\u00e6 as a deserted place,\\nthe possession of a single man. Yet the potestas of Fiden\\u00e6 -- perhaps\\nits dictator -- may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered\\non in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntemn\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nIt is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography\\nthat its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal\\ncharms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that\\nit has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.\\nThe merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages\\nback. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of\\nall ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are\\nof one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no\\nmonuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it\\nwill be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to\\nthis kind of research. At Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6 the great merit is that\\nthere is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the\\nmore to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fiden\\u00e6\\nuntouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;\\nbut we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.\\nAnd no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 full of Roman\\nand medi\\u00e6val monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,\\nas they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But\\nwe turn from Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 to a city compared with which Veii and\\nFiden\\u00e6 might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,\\nan exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fiden\\u00e6. The\\nsites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside\\nthe sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much\\nnearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it\\ndoes not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,\\neven more truly than at Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6, say that the very ruins\\nhave perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished\\nyet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special\\nattraction of its own.\\n\\nWe took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemn\\u00e6 both from the road to the\\nWhite Hens and from the road to Fiden\\u00e6. As we before said, it ought\\nto be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things\\nare not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh\\nfrom the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the\\nMilvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the\\noldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,\\nto let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that\\nof Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when\\nthe bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic\\nenemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood\\nthe host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius\\nor of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,\\nand how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time\\nwe keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We\\nare therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite\\nanother part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,\\nwho is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.\\nOur present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with\\nBelisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome\\nwas, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We\\nwalk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with\\nthe eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the\\nEtruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,\\nboth come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,\\nthat it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary\\nstream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct\\nand hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie\\nof origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the\\nmost frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor\\nwere sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a\\ndenizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was\\nlike handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path\\nkeeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at\\nall, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a\\nrocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside\\nthe Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters\\nwhen Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.\\nBut, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on\\na site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient\\nsettlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells\\nof any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in\\nthe hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy\\nhill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern\\nside by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemn\\u00e6, a vanished\\ncity whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive\\nwords. Antemn\\u00e6 was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose\\ndaughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers\\ncalled Quenfang , what sociologists called exogamy , which secured\\nthat the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;\\nRome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of\\nnobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemn\\u00e6 is merged, in Rome. We\\nmay be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which\\ngive Antemn\\u00e6 a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to\\nbe that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the\\nsite was, as now, like Fiden\\u00e6, the possession of a single man.\\n\\nThe story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus\\nspares at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.\\nParted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern\\npoint, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at\\nthe very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the\\ndescriptive name Antemnae , the town before the rivers. Such a site\\nbelongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the\\nPalatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was\\nwhile it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive\\nname, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree\\nof progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from\\nthe oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without\\nthe Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like\\nRome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which\\nmust cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be\\nincorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.\\n\\nOf a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that\\nwe can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the\\nsite. Antemn\\u00e6 has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some\\nstones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to\\nbe part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise\\ngreen hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.\\nBut the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates\\nare as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those\\nof Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fiden\\u00e6 and its surroundings, on\\nthe old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge\\nof Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the\\nGaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and\\nsome of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly\\nthe whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's\\n\\\"turriger\\u00e6 Antemn\\u00e6.\\\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the\\ntowers thereof than we were at Veii and Fiden\\u00e6. At Antemn\\u00e6 the ruins\\nthemselves have perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOstia.\\n\\n\\nFrom the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight\\nremains which mark the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6, from the almost more\\ninstructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemn\\u00e6, we may\\nwell pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any\\nof them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because\\nit was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This\\nis the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an\\nearly stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what\\nRome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making\\nRome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to\\npossess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once\\nmarked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland\\ntowns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and\\nnothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven\\nof Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes\\nOstia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.\\nAnd the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to\\nsupport it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as\\nproving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period\\nwhich is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,\\nperiod. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal\\nAncus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that\\nthe events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep\\nourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition\\nthen calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is\\nthat whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,\\nand that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.\\n\\nThis at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities\\nof that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime\\nenterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.\\nCorinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain\\ncitadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth\\nstarted in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.\\nIt marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies\\nabsolutely in the sea -- Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on\\nher peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland\\nAthens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on\\nthe broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand\\nthe value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or\\nVeii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet\\nmore. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or\\neven Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful\\nfor her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There\\nwere inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no\\ninland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.\\nIndeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime\\nor otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had\\nno separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a\\ndistance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.\\n\\nOstia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is\\neminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of\\nthose fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He\\nhas changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a\\nlittle dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which\\nhave been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,\\nand they have brought to light much that is most interesting and\\ninstructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in\\nvain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon\\nas they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its\\npavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,\\nleads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end\\nis gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to\\nthe stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to\\nimitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his\\nsuccessor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside\\nthe mouth of the cloaca maxima ; make a strong wall of defence against\\nthe waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long\\nas the cloaca maxima itself.\\n\\nAnd what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small\\npart of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia\\nis becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a\\nsomewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first\\nwith the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment\\never happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery\\nof Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at\\nwidely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing\\nwhich is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there\\nor anywhere else -- namely, destruction by the Saracens in the fifth \\ncentury, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \\\"Handbook,\\\" but which was\\ncertainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored\\nby Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as\\nthe haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards\\novercame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for\\nit. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change\\nwhich it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour\\nof Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to\\nlive on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings\\nlater than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with\\ngraceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is\\nabundant evidence that all through the second century of our \\u00e6ra great\\narchitectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there\\nis the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so\\nproudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions\\nsupply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be\\ntoo much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which\\ncertainly suggests that of Arles.\\n\\nIn the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he\\ncomplains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course\\nof the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is\\neminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,\\nsome rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber\\nmakes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,\\nif Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of\\nwalls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,\\namong the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides\\nof a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,\\nbelonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were\\nclearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall\\nwas broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;\\nthey chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best\\nsuited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may\\nwell have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The\\nwall of Servius had ceased to serve any military purpose, and the wall\\nof Aurelian was not yet.\\n\\nThe history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain\\nattempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into Gregoriopolis ,\\nbelongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its\\ncastle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but\\nwith seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old\\nOstia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart custode , who defends\\nhimself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle\\nof Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the\\ncathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which\\nnothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;\\nthe staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among\\ncardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the\\nolder site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated\\nstate. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a\\nstreet dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses\\nitself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,\\nleaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.\\nAt Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is\\ndug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the\\nfar greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are\\ncontent; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and\\nMother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with\\nFather Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our\\nguide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,\\nset forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly\\nminded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alban Mount.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places\\nwhich bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie\\nso far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different\\nnations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of\\nconnexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has\\nsettled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must\\nnot forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell\\nin the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or\\nAlbany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic\\nwas lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,\\nshe spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that\\nshe might have answered with a tu quoque or something more; the\\nEnglishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.\\nBut have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with\\nthe Duke of Al v a -- for in his tongue \\\"non aliud est v i v ere quam\\n b i b ere\\\" -- or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is\\nsingular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of\\nRome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as\\nthose by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and\\nthose Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.\\nIt is \\u1fec\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1\\u1fd6\\u03bf\\u03b9 and \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af in both cases, without the change of jot or\\ntittle. In this case, at least, we believe that philologers would deny\\nthe slightest kindred between the names; but the casual identity is\\nthereby only made the more startling. A malicious critic might say\\nthat Anna's Romans were as unlike old Romans as her Albanians could be\\nunlike the men of Alba Longa. But her Romans did at least claim to be\\nRomans, sharers in the inheritance of the wolf and the eagle; while\\nher Albanians certainly laid no claims to any rights in the Alban sow\\nand her thirty pigs.\\n\\nRome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly\\nthat its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in\\nderivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount\\nkept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There\\nis the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely\\ninterwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road\\nby which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still\\nthe displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre\\nof the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the\\npillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of\\ncrowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes\\nhis eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she\\ndid in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as\\nfavourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood\\nof living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,\\naccording to one version of his story, his body -- or perhaps only his\\nhead -- found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the\\nAlexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had\\nso many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all Albana ,\\nthe Albanum of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long\\nterraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The\\nwalled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Pr\\u00e6torian\\ncamp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still\\nexists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still\\nkeeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,\\nseek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano\\nand Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.\\nIn both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in\\nthe neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between\\nthem, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample\\nruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato\\nstood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in\\nher day of overthrow.\\n\\nThe town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most\\nprominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from\\nRome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn\\nstone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cn\\u00e6us Pompeius\\nMagnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its\\neffect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers\\nbetween the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.\\nWhich of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more\\nimpossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the\\noutline of the Glastonbury kitchen -- before its chimneys perished -- and\\nthereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of\\nthe camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several\\nother fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.\\nBut after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a\\nstarting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less\\nas a starting-point for\\n\\n ... the still glassy lake that sleeps\\n Beneath Aricia's trees.\\n\\nAricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to\\nthe level of the arx , to be approached by Albano by almost the only\\nwork on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct\\nof that \\\"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\\\" -- his votaries seem never quite to\\ndistinguish between him and Jupiter -- is really a work worthy of C\\u00e6sars\\nor consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments\\nof walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,\\nthe crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest\\nsurely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps\\nof prim\\u00e6val wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare\\nus for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;\\nwalls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,\\nand to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \\\"still glassy\\nlake\\\" to which the grove of the \\\"rex nemorensis\\\" has given the name of\\nNemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled\\nyears and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nIn these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for\\nventuring on an allusion which it might need a little research to take\\nin. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with\\nourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the\\nexplanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process\\nis a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to\\nspeak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat\\ngrotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better\\nknown as Caligula.\\n\\nThe ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,\\nand the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by\\nthe present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and\\nwho, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi\\nfrom close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among\\nthings, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow\\nof Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of\\nits height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so\\nwe go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we\\nfind the emissarius , so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done\\nits work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some\\none long before Camillus? The men who built the great cloaca of\\nRome were quite capable of cutting the hole through the rock of Alba,\\nwithout any message from Delphi or any design against the walls of\\nVeii. Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than\\nClaudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it\\nhas been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,\\nwe may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only\\nto keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp\\ntill we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy\\nof the name crater . We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side\\nby side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some\\ntime which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to\\nsay that it was long before the oldest prim\\u00e6val wall, the powers of\\nwater supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with\\nits narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable\\nto be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily\\ncome to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,\\ntaken to check it.\\n\\nBut when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house\\nwhich the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by\\nthe rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called\\nfields of Hannibal -- yet another crater, science tells us -- when we have\\nclimbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed\\nunderstand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than\\nwe did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over\\nthe battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Pr\\u00e6neste; it\\nmay range hither and thither over many points which have their charm\\nboth of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the\\nhistorical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will\\nbetter take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven\\nhills shrunk out of sight, a point -- rather a line -- in the Latin plain,\\nwith a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different\\nwas the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see\\nhow she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we\\nsee how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;\\nand we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look\\ndown too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the\\nvanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great\\nflat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.\\nHere, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where\\n\\n ... the Witch's Fortress\\n O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.\\n\\nAnd beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more\\ndistant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as\\na height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name\\nof Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,\\nnot only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights\\naround it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we\\nfeel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of\\nwide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a\\npower seated at Veii or at Pr\\u00e6neste. Rome, on her great river, with\\nher haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or\\nallies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the\\ngreat powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread\\nEtruscan pirates and Ph\\u0153nician traders; the Greek of Cum\\u00e6 might\\nperhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.\\nWe may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the\\nfall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that\\nare left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was\\nthat Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the\\ncamping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we\\nbelieve in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how\\nthings had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the\\nCarthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into\\nItaly by land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCori.\\n\\n\\nThere was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the\\nAcademy a little time back, that there must be something \\\"irritating to\\nthe Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often\\nadopted by English writers towards Italian history.\\\" \\\"Their cities,\\\"\\nhe said, \\\"which are still instinct with political and social life, are\\nregarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque\\nreminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\\\" Mr. Creighton was\\nspeaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he\\nsays may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where\\nthe political and social life at least hides itself from the passing\\ntourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as\\nnothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the\\ncity seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;\\nit is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after soldi \\nwhich nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid\\nof; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying\\nwhich the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree\\nmore advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less\\nfar back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once\\nindependent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,\\nand, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they\\nwere, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are\\nnow, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than\\ntheir successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty\\nof the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants -- far\\nkeener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the\\ncity awakens in his mind -- really does him no harm. The modern Latins\\nor Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of\\nthe country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the\\ncuriosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the\\nPrisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave\\nand discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when\\nhe knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is\\nsomething grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the\\nsight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the\\ncentre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;\\nnot exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not\\nill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.\\n\\nSomething of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at\\nleast, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right\\nwing of the Latin host of Regillus:\\n\\n Aricia, Cora, Norba,\\n Velitr\\u00e6, with the might\\n Of Setia and of Tusculum.\\n\\nTusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate\\npilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban\\nmount; \\\"Setia's purple vineyards\\\" it may be hard to take into the line\\nof march; but, with a slight change of order, \\\"Velitr\\u00e6, Cora, Norba,\\\"\\nwith the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,\\nwill form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have\\nmade it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that\\nthey have not cut into two. Velitr\\u00e6 -- hardly changed in the modern\\nVelletri -- has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest\\nbell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps\\nin, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps\\nout the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;\\nit stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter\\nneighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the\\necclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral\\nchurch placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom\\nof the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern\\npalaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman\\nremains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of medi\\u00e6val times. The\\nchief value of the town is as a starting-point -- we can hardly call it\\ncentre -- for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The\\nview from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,\\ndying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the\\nmighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all\\nthe height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its\\nfollowing of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like\\na great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean\\nDown and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes\\ntowards them by something more than their bright masses, something more\\nthan a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points\\nare crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned\\nstands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far\\nlower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some\\nway down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when\\nthe sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for\\nwhich Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for -- \\n\\n ... the gigantic watch-towers,\\n No work of earthly men,\\n Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook\\n The never-ending fen.\\n\\nWatch-towers, perhaps, in the strictest sense, we do not see, and we\\nshall hardly find them when we come nearer; but Cora, Cori , still\\nkeeps the mightiest of walls, which it was no wonder that men looked\\non as too mighty to be the work of such mortals -- in Homer's phrase -- as\\nwe now are, and looked on them as reared by no hands weaker than those\\nof the forgers of Jove's own thunderbolts. With Cori we enter on the\\nexamination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their\\nprim\\u00e6val walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the\\nwalls that are the most prim\\u00e6val of all. None of its fellows can show\\nsuch blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call\\nCyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside\\nwhat is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see\\nelsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together\\nas they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;\\nhuge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between\\nthem filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole\\nrange of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious\\nin such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,\\nRoman of Sulla's day, and -- the leap is a great one -- medi\\u00e6val walls\\nof the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin\\nking of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him\\nas sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first\\nfour -- we have already spoken of the first of all -- are all polygonal,\\nof distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.\\nThe rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the\\nbottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the\\n arx which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament\\nof Cori in quite another department.\\n\\nAccording to the nearly invariable rule, the arx of Cora contained\\na temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into\\na church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in\\nmany other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without\\ndamaging the portico of the house of Hercules -- the old Latin Herculus\\nwas hopelessly confused with the H\\u00earakl\\u00eas of Greek legend -- and still\\nkeeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;\\nkeeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his cella , the\\ninscription which records the work of the local duumvirs , Manlius\\nand Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They\\nprofess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they\\nstand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the\\nCapitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive\\nas P\\u00e6stum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,\\nthe upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,\\nand it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against\\nrule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns -- such as are\\nleft -- of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;\\nbut we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the\\npeculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not\\nspeak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise\\nagain after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?\\nStern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and\\nfavourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to\\nsome such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points\\nof view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.\\n\\nBut we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of\\nthis strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning\\nat a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss\\nof Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we\\nare tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few\\nfragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We\\nlight too on inscriptions. Besides the duumvirs -- one might call them\\nthe bailiffs -- of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the\\nfrieze of Hercules, another commemorates two Praitors ; surely these,\\nwith their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin\\nCommonwealth -- as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium -- dependent on\\nRome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the\\nchief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to\\nChristian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,\\nan altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's\\nhead, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.\\nOliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it\\nis a lovely cloister of that better kind of Renaissance which was in\\ntruth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials\\nof earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them\\nwith capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be\\nfound in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a\\nplace for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba\\ncannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the\\ntraveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him\\ntake his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than\\nsleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up\\nearly in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him\\nrather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorba.\\n\\n\\nWe will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers\\nhaving been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on\\ntheir way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,\\nskirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views\\nof the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea\\nbeyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when\\nthe traveller has found a firm foothold within \\\"Norba's ancient wall\\\"\\nthan while he has personal experience how\\n\\n The patient ass, up flinty paths,\\n Plods with his weary load.\\n\\nStill worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded\\ndown, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy\\nto persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness\\nof the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to\\nbe unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;\\nthe hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on\\nhis own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the\\nwall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the\\nass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed\\nwhen we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find\\nhow far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs\\nspring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will\\nbe almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in\\nkind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he\\ncannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.\\nFor within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for\\nthe crops are there, full and green -- \\\" segetes, ubi Norba fuit \\\" -- but\\nthe ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.\\nWe would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now\\ndoes ever since the people of Norba -- less wise, as the event showed,\\nthan their neighbours of Cora -- embraced the cause of Marius with such\\ndesperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather\\nthan let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.\\nThis inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in\\nat least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate\\ndictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great\\nsingle blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma\\nby its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has\\nperished only less utterly than Norba itself.\\n\\nCori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has\\nany fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.\\nCori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread\\ndown the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the\\nmountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a\\nsteep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves\\ndownwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.\\nBut we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so\\ncarefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various\\npoints on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers\\ndeemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the arx \\nrose on several terraces; its highest point -- crowned, we may believe,\\nas usual, by a temple -- must have formed a proud object indeed from the\\nvast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its\\nancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine\\nflat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori\\nrather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits\\non the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower\\nelevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples\\nof the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as\\nit is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,\\nwhich does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.\\nIt is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken\\nthe place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we see that Norma and Norba\\nby no means join one another; there is a gap between them which, while\\nwe are on the mountain, might pass for a valley. But as we look from\\nbelow, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,\\nand Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like\\na continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,\\nperhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within\\nwhich the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can\\ntake in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of\\nSermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the\\nwhole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points\\nwith which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from\\nthe height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and\\nnew proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable\\nmembers of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front\\nof the Circ\\u00e6an height -- a height so nearly cut off from the mainland\\nthat it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we\\nbetter understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days\\nwhen they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked\\nin what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of\\nmolehills by the yellow Tiber.\\n\\nAs the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by\\nthe walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill\\nstands distinct, the arx alone crowns the top, and where the town\\nwalls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts\\nitself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass\\nof the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the\\nrudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they\\nhave a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,\\nand it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone\\nhas been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of\\nthe weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the\\nfiner stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth\\ntheir while, do something more than this. They could, when they had\\nto make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of\\nexactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded\\noff, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at\\nthe greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign\\nof either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it\\nwould almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the\\nopening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung\\nbetween two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the\\nfirst builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which\\nmen began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great\\ninvention, is shown by a ruined building -- one of the few things within\\nthe wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building -- a little\\nway beyond the arx . Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for\\nthe roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea and New Grange,\\nnor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and\\nthe attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well\\nas from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,\\nmost unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call\\nthem, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange\\nproblem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have\\nalready hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,\\nlike that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as\\nwell come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.\\n\\nFrom prim\\u00e6val and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning\\nas we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only\\nmedi\\u00e6val, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is\\na house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least\\njust outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual\\ndwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have\\nonce been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which\\nstrikes us between the stern prim\\u00e6val wall of Norba, fencing in the\\nthick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied\\nand picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and\\nbuildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till\\na thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,\\nroofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of\\nruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of\\na dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played\\nits part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested\\nby its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to\\ndo with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed\\nelection. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,\\nled to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to\\nbe reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak\\nmight restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder\\nmen living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa\\nwithout greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is\\nsomething specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,\\nstanding so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look\\nof things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of\\nthe ruined medi\\u00e6val sites which often meet us in this region. It is\\nnot merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something\\nIrish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both\\nat Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in\\nIreland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,\\nthere is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might\\nhave been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of\\nthe houses reaching even into Renaissance times. The church of most\\npretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses\\nand the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness\\nof ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a\\ntown, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa\\nhas little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As\\nfor the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on\\nthe hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an\\nunrecorded age piled together to make Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegni.\\n\\n\\nThe visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history\\non the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite\\ncertain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take\\nwith him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there\\nmay be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a\\nhidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that\\nclass, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes\\nnothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they\\ndo not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A\\nnatural and important question is sure to present itself, and -- without\\nwings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome -- there is no immediate\\nmeans of answering it. Is the name of Signia -- now by a very slight\\nchange Segni -- to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of\\nLatium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry\\nthem all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in\\nwhich Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every\\nstep that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully\\nadmire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out\\nin each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his\\nquotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still\\nMacaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,\\nif he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian\\nand Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the\\nfact that \\\"Ferentinum of the rock,\\\" yet further on, has its place in\\nthem alongside of \\\"Gabia of the pool.\\\" He turns to his guide-book -- and\\nthe guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,\\nis almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only\\nthe entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with\\nthe remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.\\nAnd again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in\\nthe later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part -- Were the\\npeople of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic\\npavements? There is a kind of work called opus Signinum , a pattern\\nof black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at\\nPompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an\\nexample a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting\\nas the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin\\nLeague. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which\\nit will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had\\nat Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself\\na little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the\\nplace where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to\\nthe great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he\\nmay for the moment comfort himself by thinking that there are those who\\nmight be unkind enough to hint that he would still be equally uncertain\\nif he had a hundred quotations on the tip of his tongue, or if he were\\nin a library with thousands of volumes to turn to.\\n\\nBut whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not -- we may be\\nallowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \\\"a\\nSix-preacher\\\" -- there is no doubt as to its geographical position;\\nthere is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from\\nVelletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of \\u00c6quian\\nencampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the\\nVolscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between\\nthem and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark\\nmore than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by\\nus, in the low ground -- reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale -- the\\nwalls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful\\nheight and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves\\nhidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,\\nas we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its\\nmountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller\\ndetached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.\\n\\nSegni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the\\nsame class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but\\na table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on\\nthe mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it\\nwith Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the\\nimmediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the\\nsame as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano\\nhas more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of\\nbeing an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long\\nand narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the\\nspace within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The\\nspace within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded\\nwith dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one\\nquarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other\\ncases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the arx of\\nSignia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,\\nbut placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between\\nthe two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of\\nthe modern Signians; but under the name of Passegiata it does form\\npart of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the\\nother loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the\\ntraveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of\\nthe road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway\\nof Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the\\ngreat number of graceful fragments of medi\\u00e6val work to be found within\\nthe narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages\\ntoo poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing\\nbeauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from\\nentering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit\\nof the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the\\nright hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case\\noverwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen\\nfar away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the\\ngateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as\\nit were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing\\nwhich the prim\\u00e6val city has to show him.\\n\\nBut before he can reach either the Roman or the prim\\u00e6val gate he will\\nhave begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is\\nhardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great\\ndeal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.\\nThe huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note\\nperhaps two stages, yet often intermingled -- one, where the sides only \\nof the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where\\nthe outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \\\"rustication\\\" in\\nlate Renaissance work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a\\nstate of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the\\nshape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In\\na later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand\\nfree from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy\\nto say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how\\nmuch to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it\\nsomewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,\\nand a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.\\nBut it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of\\nthe hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the\\nwhole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required\\nit, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some\\ndistance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally\\nknown as Porta Saracenesca , leads from the outside world into the\\nouter enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close\\nto the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most\\nlikely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds\\nno small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of\\nthose instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of\\nthe principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search\\nof it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out\\nof stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they\\nwere striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting\\non two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as\\nthose of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle\\nof the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was\\nto place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately\\nunder the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of\\nthe lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain\\nvain striving after something different. As such, it is no small\\nlesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled\\ntogether to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us\\nback from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when\\nthe arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days\\nwhen men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of\\nconstructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are\\nmere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look\\nthan those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the\\nlintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever\\ntheir relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to\\ninnovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last\\ncrowned with success.\\n\\nIt is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can\\nunderstand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,\\nwhich has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called\\n arco Gotico ; it is harder to guess why the great prim\\u00e6val gate of\\nSegni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only\\nprim\\u00e6val gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been\\ncounted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of\\nthe enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall\\ncoincide. Hard by Porta Saracenesca itself is a small sally-port;\\nof the others, the larger ones, like Porta Saracenesca itself,\\nstand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same\\nstrivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the\\nground forbids the arx from reaching any great height above the rest\\nof the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular\\nlarge cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions\\nof different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.\\nHere is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive\\nconstruction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the cella in\\nRoman masonry, and the Roman wall of the cella is now carried up to\\nform a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,\\nbut it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes\\nwhich the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.\\n\\nLanded, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of\\nthe greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its\\nsatellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide\\navailable at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case\\nwe see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third\\nand greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of\\nSegni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the\\nCatholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.\\nPeter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.\\n\\nWe are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over\\nthe valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with\\ndouble force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,\\nbut still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and\\nhis lion-like reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIter ad Brundisium.\\n\\nI. Anagni.\\n\\n\\nHe who goes steadily from Rome to Brindisi, seeing what comes in his\\nway by the easiest manner of going, will not come very much oftener\\non the track of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is\\nthe haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he\\ncan along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will\\nof necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from\\nRome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.\\nBut the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and\\nits lesser fellow -- the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and\\ndry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child\\nAlbano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the\\ntemple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left -- all\\nthese seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So\\nmay the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre, -- the\\nhill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \\\"Norba's ancient wall,\\\" with\\nneither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it -- Ninfa's more modern\\nwall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,\\nruined churches, in abundance -- all these may be connected with an\\n iter ad Brundisium , but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let\\nour traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway -- we were\\ngoing to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could\\nwell be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his\\ntime-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni\\nand go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.\\nNot that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the\\ngates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It\\nwould most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,\\nprince of guidebook-makers, recommends the locanda there as \\\"reinlich\\nund eidlich,\\\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller\\nwill be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more\\ninclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is\\nno doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,\\nAnagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is\\nthe first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is\\nnot unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make\\nAnagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest\\nfor the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome\\nbut from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points\\nin some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he\\nwill be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,\\nalmost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is\\nas the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met\\nhis end, the prisoner -- not the last Pope who was fated so to be -- of\\na French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the\\nmind. In medi\\u00e6val history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to\\nthis day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress\\nmeaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.\\nAnagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore\\ndid not suffer at the hands of Renaissance Popes as Rome lived to\\nsuffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well\\ngo back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,\\nthen Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome\\nwhich neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and\\nPyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in\\nwhich Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation\\nof the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is\\nharder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading\\nOld-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few\\npersonal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or\\nOld-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical\\nor legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,\\nand the one great event in their political history; and those tell us\\na great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom\\nSpurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great\\nTriple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having\\nneither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,\\nthey hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.\\nBut their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust\\nin as they were between \\u00c6quians and Volscians, no alliance could\\nbe more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most\\nexposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself\\nwas the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle\\nmust have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must\\nhave looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants\\nof the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have\\nendured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening\\nneighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to\\nanother, we better understand the political relations of the endless\\nlittle communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The\\nally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need\\nto climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack\\nor deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them\\ntherefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare\\nand without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but\\nthey were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's\\nsight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at\\nAnagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either\\nat Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If\\nin some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less\\nclearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as\\nits symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one\\nanother could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.\\nThey must be always doing something to one another in the way either\\nof friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when\\nSpurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the\\nfirst Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land\\nand its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed\\nput a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.\\n\\nWe come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded\\nin by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni\\nand Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an\\nisolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,\\nthe city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the\\nhill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the\\nmiddle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief\\nstreet between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the\\nhill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,\\nthan can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,\\nallowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,\\nand a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must\\nconfess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well\\ntheir bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works\\nof the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the\\ndifference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious\\nforms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring\\nus back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by\\nordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord\\nMacaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there\\nwould have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \\\"no work of\\nearthly men,\\\" or as -- \\n\\n Reared by the hands of giants\\n For godlike kings of old.\\n\\nThe walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome\\nare wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to\\nput together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it\\nwas to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who\\nthoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use\\nit with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,\\nround the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they\\nare broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others\\nmerely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone\\nthrough all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the\\ncourse of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a\\nwhole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a\\ngood deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to\\ntheir nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.\\nIn some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by\\nfurther defences, buttresses rather than towers -- defences, by-the-way,\\nwhich must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later\\ntimes. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,\\ngreater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and\\nalways laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of\\nlarger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones\\nof two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a\\nlight-coloured stone exactly like the puff-stone of Gloucestershire,\\nthe material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings\\nin that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark\\nvolcanic peperino , which, towards the south-eastern part of the wall,\\nis used much more freely. The general effect, wherever the wall is at\\nall perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and\\ncolour.\\n\\nNow was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a\\ncertain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back\\nto our library; we take down the Dictionary of Geography ; we turn to\\nthe article \\\"Anagnia,\\\" and we find that by far the best contributor to\\nthe series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings\\nare damped when he says, \\\"The only remains extant there are of Roman\\ndate and of little interest.\\\" As to the \\\"little interest,\\\" we venture\\nto have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great\\nan extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an\\nobject of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the\\nlatest days which could come under the definition of \\\"Roman date.\\\"\\nBut what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of\\nthe Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us\\nto believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic\\nEmperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call\\nthe Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For\\nMarcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \\\" Flamen sume\\nsamentum .\\\" He did not know what \\\" samentum \\\" meant, and we cannot find\\nthe word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its\\nmeaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which\\nthe flamen put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want\\nto be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans\\nat some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they\\nhad no fellowship with the prim\\u00e6val works at Cori and at Segni; they\\ndid seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at\\nRome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the\\nwalls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from\\na Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were\\nburthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may\\ncarry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read\\nbetween four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,\\nwe shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the\\ndays of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have\\nlooked.\\n\\nOne thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the\\nbuilders of the cloaca at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders\\nof Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On\\nthe highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out\\ntowards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient arx , we may\\nstill see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised\\nby the arrangements of the medi\\u00e6val castle, the double gate of the\\nancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well\\nturned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same\\nworkmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the\\nbeginning. The arx itself, it should be remembered, had its separate\\nwall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the\\nsame character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street\\na little lower down.\\n\\nWhen we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character\\nin which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican\\nwalls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is\\nso far more famous as the city of medi\\u00e6val Popes that it is fitting\\nthat it should have something to show in that character also. The\\ntown is rich in medi\\u00e6val fragments. The main street, in its winding\\ncourses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,\\nwhich, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,\\nno small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with\\narches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one\\npapal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent\\nBishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for\\ntheir span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal\\npalace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,\\non its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France\\nor England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases\\noften present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the\\nmain street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches\\nresting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And\\nan elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender\\nshaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless\\nto add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these\\nrelics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured\\nand mutilated.\\n\\nIn the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good\\nfragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but\\nthe cathedral church within the arx is the only one which has the\\nleast claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on\\nthe edge of the hill with its east end -- that is, what would be east\\naccording to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west -- rising\\nup nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a\\nstately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on\\ntwo sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is\\nin a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the\\nchurch is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of\\nthe Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,\\nless satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains\\nthe vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many\\nother curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;\\nlet us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at\\nleast, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern\\nof the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the\\nmother-church of Rome and of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Ferentino.\\n\\n\\nItaly contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,\\nas England contains two places -- perhaps more -- bearing the several\\nnames of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,\\nRochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester\\nis also very conveniently written Rutchester , so the Etruscan\\nFerentinum is also conveniently written Ferentia . On an iter ad\\nBrundisium we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan\\nFerentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to\\nthe Itineraries, was to be found on the Via Latina between Anagnia\\nand Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name\\nof the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,\\nits ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is\\nHernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet\\nit is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the\\nendless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other\\ncompany that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest\\nremembrance of the name places \\\"Ferentinum of the rock\\\" among the\\nThirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot\\nwith the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the\\nrule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where -- \\n\\n ... in the centre thickest\\n Were ranged the shields of foes,\\n And from the centre loudest\\n The cry of battle rose.\\n\\nYet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to\\nfind a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican\\nhills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant\\ncomrades as Tibur and Pedum and \\\"Gabii of the pool.\\\" And, when we\\ncome back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more\\nand more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in\\nthat list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess -- among a\\nhundred other guesses -- at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next\\nbefore Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near\\nto our mark as Fortinei ; so we may hope for the best; but remembering\\nwhere Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes\\nare small.\\n\\nIn obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way\\nto Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take\\nin the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.\\nTill we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that\\nAnagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and\\nthe rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill\\nof Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that\\nthe spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \\\"Ferentinum\\nof the rock.\\\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many\\nother hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we\\nbegin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord\\nMacaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has\\nat least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the\\nrock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,\\nand sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.\\nAnd the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of\\nour series. They are still standing through the greater part of their\\nancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,\\ndiffering in material and construction. There is an original lower\\npart of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as\\nrude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which\\nthis earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,\\nbut it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later\\nrepairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction\\nof very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were\\nnot for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work\\nhas a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction\\nand material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work\\nby the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the\\narch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.\\nThe only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with\\nmerely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from\\nthe modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones\\nof the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient\\nentrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they\\nwere, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take\\na military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.\\nAnother gate, now known as Porta Maggiore , is a much more elaborate\\nwork, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is\\nplaced with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall\\nturns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great\\nadvantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows\\nwhether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult\\njust at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes\\nleast interesting. When we have to scramble -- all at least save Alpine\\nclimbers -- with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,\\nwe are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of\\nconstruction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to\\nrefer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no\\nsuch necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,\\nand the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed\\nat the same time. And at one point, not far from the Porta Maggiore ,\\nit will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long\\ninscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,\\nAulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part\\nat Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later\\nat Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of\\nhis day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty\\nbushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the\\nboys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the\\nwill of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity\\nCommissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get\\ntheir nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance -- yet\\nmany well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf -- will they\\ndevise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the\\nbenefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions\\nnearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the Times \\nwas filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in\\nSomerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once\\nstanding in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In\\none point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more\\nlucky. When Ferentinum had quatuorviri , they did not bury people in\\ntheir temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to\\npeople who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates\\nthe bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to\\nbe seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,\\nas a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his\\nbenefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated\\nby Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we\\ntrust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,\\nPopes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull\\ndown buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and\\nvillas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which\\nshould go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.\\n\\nWe have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we\\nwish -- we must confess the weakness -- to see independent Hernicans\\nwherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come\\nback and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum\\nspoken of, without any special emotion, as \\\"Roman.\\\" We look up\\nagain in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word\\ncertainly means something quite different from what it commonly\\nmeans in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light\\non anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us\\nto accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far\\nback as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think\\nthat the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old\\nCorinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great\\npiece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more\\nimportant -- though about the comparative importance some might raise a\\ndoubt -- than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them\\nby the proper road; we must get into what once was the arx , what\\nis now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,\\necclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly\\nthrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or\\nhouses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that\\nFerentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,\\nand several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed\\nat Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept\\nasunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the\\nsmall and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The\\nmost striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the\\nmass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the\\nbell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the arx , as a\\nmighty sub-structure. The walls of the arx show the same two dates\\nas the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude\\nstones of the first period; at another part they support the upper\\nrange of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to\\nHernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the\\n\\\"Roman\\\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of\\nthe censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius -- censors, that is, not\\nof Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first\\nvolume of the great Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , p. 238, and\\nits closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the Priscae\\nLatinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica . Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus\\nLollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known\\npersons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one\\nasks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got\\nhold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They\\nhad no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they\\nare written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the\\nRoman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have\\nbuilt what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside\\nonly mean that they built the later work on the top of the prim\\u00e6val\\nwall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an\\narchaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in\\nthe Tabularium of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row\\nof triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \\\"Cornelius Lucius Scipio\\nGnaivod patre prognatus.\\\" But we need not go back quite so far as his\\nday. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla\\nwill do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans\\nof Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.\\nFerentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns\\nwhich were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows\\nis most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,\\nrefused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather\\nto remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,\\nthe old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of\\nthe Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and\\nmagistrates -- Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them -- subject\\nonly to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars\\nof Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful\\nRomans.\\n\\nThis last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.\\n3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth\\nthe wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman pr\\u00e6tor suddenly\\nwished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for\\nherself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so\\nher husband bade the two qu\\u00e6stors of the town to be seized; one was\\nscourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the\\nwords of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which\\nRoman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities\\neven of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.\\n\\nIt is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the town as\\na municipium , while Livy also casually implies its possession of the\\nLatin franchise. Such obiter dicta do not go for very much. Scholars\\nsometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only\\ncasual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus\\nnot long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to\\naccuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the\\nWest of England. We here read of \\\"the county of the city of Bristol,\\\"\\nthe \\\"borough of Gloucester,\\\" the \\\"borough of Bath,\\\" and the \\\"borough of\\nTaunton.\\\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting\\nthat Bath is a \\\"city\\\" and Gloucester even a \\\"county of a city.\\\" May\\nwe not sometimes get wrong about municipia and Latin colonies from\\nthe same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a\\n municipium , but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,\\nwe once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the\\nelectors of a county to elect, not a \\\"knight of the shire,\\\" as they\\nhad done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called\\na \\\"member of Parliament.\\\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and\\neven Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,\\n curiae , and centuries, in ages long before their own day?\\n\\nThe walls then, though called \\\"Roman\\\" in a vague sense -- that is, it\\nwould seem, simply not prim\\u00e6val, like those of Cori and Segni -- are\\ndoubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was\\nstill a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most\\nlikely the walls over which the unlucky qu\\u00e6stor threw himself. The\\nwalls of the arx , where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,\\nconnect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the\\ninscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and\\nfrom the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral -- a\\nvery good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.\\nThe church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal\\ndamaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its\\nbell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A\\nlittle restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make\\nit into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,\\nunless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,\\nantiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little\\nminster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except\\nby comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if\\nthe church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime\\nof the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what\\nwe heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the\\ncrime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually\\nbegun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as\\nyet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse\\nto drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.\\n\\nThe church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen\\nthere in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant\\nvoice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the\\n arx -- buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account -- strange\\ntales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place\\neither in history or in received legend. Among other things he was\\nthrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a\\nvery pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one\\ndesigns to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,\\nit strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or\\nas we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other\\necclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city\\nof the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these\\nplaces; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which\\nhas an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people\\nwho chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome\\nlose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy\\nplaces of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and\\nanother creed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. Alatri.\\n\\n\\nThe tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with prim\\u00e6val walls, among\\nwhich we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at\\nAlatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly\\nclaim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest\\nplace, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is\\nthe one which has the least history. There is very little to say about\\nit, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but\\npreferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the\\nproffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained\\na distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least\\nthere can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich\\nin medi\\u00e6val antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich\\nin Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or\\nless Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri\\nnearly everything that we care about is strictly prim\\u00e6val. We cannot\\nreasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look\\nwere there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new\\nthen.\\n\\nAlatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in\\nall ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no\\nplace in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni\\nor Ferentino -- nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of\\ngoing and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked\\non as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without\\ncalling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are\\nnow following -- a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among\\nthem -- reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there\\nafter seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant\\njustice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed\\nit out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a\\nresting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of\\nAlatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from\\nits railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern\\nworld, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible\\nbell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to\\nAlatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for\\na while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what\\nthey saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the\\nAlatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of\\nthe walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the arx , are the most\\nprominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond\\nour immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited\\ntown. At Alatri indeed the prim\\u00e6val walls are so prominent that in the\\ndistant view no one would suspect them of being prim\\u00e6val walls at all.\\nThey are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what\\nmay be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still\\nfence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as\\nin so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal\\nprecinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and\\ncentral character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The arx \\nis not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the\\nwall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The arx \\nforms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point\\nof the compass on the mountains which keep watch around -- on the little\\ntowns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights -- on\\nthe houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill\\nwhich the arx crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a\\nchurch or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding\\nsite, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These\\nhill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;\\nat Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their\\nheights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper\\ncompanions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which\\nsurrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more\\nworthy building, either the prim\\u00e6val temple itself or some more fitting\\nsuccessor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs -- let\\nus say either the Parthen\\u00f4n of Athens or the Parthen\\u00f4n of Lincoln to\\ndo it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral\\nchurch of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the\\n cella of the prim\\u00e6val temple. Here we have something even more than\\ncan be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way\\nof a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are\\nconcerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church\\nwas actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house\\ngoing back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded\\nage which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There\\nis the terrace, there is the wall of the cella , wrought of the same\\nwonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding arx , as the walls\\nof the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the\\nordinary rites of Christian worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a\\nChristian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples\\nof a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them\\nwithin walls reared in honour of we know not what -- gods of unchronicled\\ndays, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed\\nas strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of\\nJupiter of the Capitol.\\n\\nWhere the pr\\u00e6historic temple has thus become the cathedral church, it\\nis not out of keeping that the wall of the pr\\u00e6historic arx should\\nbecome the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see\\nfrom afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly\\nfurnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can\\ndistinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air\\nof a wall even of Roman, even of medi\\u00e6val, antiquity. Shall we say it?\\nAs we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the arx of\\nAlatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We\\ncould not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular\\nand rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than\\nat Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls\\nin the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls\\nbuilt on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business\\ncommonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,\\nto strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have\\nlittle or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached\\nfrom within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this\\narrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a\\nwall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.\\nThe weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at\\nthis point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which\\nthe hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are\\nwhich are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in\\nthe walls of Alatri, whether of temple, arx , or city, do we find\\nanything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the\\nstones, of whatever shape -- and they are of many shapes -- have clearly\\nbeen cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though\\nthe system according to which they are laid is not the same in every\\npart of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of\\nconstructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be\\nseen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it\\nis hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor\\ndo we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where\\nwe should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The\\ngreat gateway of the arx at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its\\nbuilders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of\\nthe arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of\\nthe lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. We suppose\\nthat the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge\\nlintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals\\nwhom those of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea could not have despised. But, except in vastness\\nof construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly\\nplain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with\\nthe really artistic work of the Myk\\u00eanaian treasuries. It goes rather\\nwith the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri\\ncould carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the arx .\\nBut they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great\\ngate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of\\nthe vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the\\ncut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within\\nit, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the\\nsteep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.\\nEven the builders of prim\\u00e6val walls clearly drew a line between what\\nwas meant to meet the public eye and what was not.\\n\\nBut we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,\\nthe walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of\\nAlatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect\\nin the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be\\ntempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular\\norder by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these\\nlast, except that they do not supply anything like the prim\\u00e6val gate,\\nare just as well worthy of study as the walls of the arx itself. They\\nremain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and\\nthey are of the same general construction as the walls of the arx .\\nAt some points a singular contrast is made by medi\\u00e6val additions to\\nthe defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic\\nwindows of the time, stands out as projections from the prim\\u00e6val wall.\\nAnd, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in\\nthe way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the\\nwalls themselves. From the arx of Alatri we look down on several\\nbell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is\\nquite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point\\nof Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or\\nout of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided\\nshaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow\\nstreets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory\\nin every point save one. There should have been some decent building,\\npagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its arx , the noblest\\nin our whole range.\\n\\nWith Alatri we end one main stage of our iter , that of the\\nhill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in\\nthe world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if\\nwe had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of\\nwork. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant\\nand profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and\\nthe Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns\\nare very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in\\nwithout anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to\\nmention that the Locanda d'Italia , at Anagni, recommended in various\\nguide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a\\nnight at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless\\nand letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better\\nthan many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.\\nIndeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed\\nrace. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,\\nperhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make\\nthe best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need\\nbe; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or\\nhe might be a Hernican -- we cannot always be exact among these obsolete\\nnationalities -- \\\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. From Alatri to Capua.\\n\\n\\nWe have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not\\nbe hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling\\nin historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to\\nexisting remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the\\nspecial necessities of an iter ad Brundisium carry us to quite other\\nparts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest\\nare fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they\\nare wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their\\nlowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our\\nwork is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant\\ncompanions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their\\nsubstitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond\\nit. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can\\ncarry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway\\nsystem of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea\\nand the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,\\nbeyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters\\nto the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a\\nchance likeness between the names -- a name that ranges from the Euxine\\nto the Hudson -- without seeking in any sort to identify the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of\\nDionysios and the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of imperial Anna, it is still with a curious\\nfeeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before were\\nlooking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the wilder\\nmountains of Albania.\\n\\nSome of those who now looked across had already learned something of\\nthose heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new\\nfeeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look\\nout on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the\\nwestern world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped\\nthemselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the\\nAlbanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to\\nbeing to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to\\nthe East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the\\nboot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on\\nthe western side of the great backbone of Italy; we have still to catch\\nglimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on\\nthe bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of\\ncloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which\\ndecrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must\\ngo and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time\\nwe have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive\\nrange of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass\\nfrom the prim\\u00e6val cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of\\nsouth-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series\\nof churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but\\ntheir memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,\\nnot indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days\\nwhen Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of\\nHellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those\\neastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.\\n\\nGreek influence indeed begins -- some say that it historically began -- on\\nthe western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the\\npresent journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.\\nWe hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from\\nFrosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding\\nourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be\\npassed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious\\ndiscomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that\\nit is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized\\nquarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,\\nhowever, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a\\nfew miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts -- we\\nwill not talk of luxuries -- have fled from Capua and have found their\\nnew home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,\\n Santa Maria di vetere Capua , not the newer Capua on the site of\\nCasilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there\\nagain, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in\\nthe way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far\\nin advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to\\nLondon. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.\\nThe name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early medi\\u00e6val\\nCapua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the\\ntown now called Capua, but at the village -- it is hardly more -- of Santa\\nMaria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of\\nSamnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the\\ncity where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of\\nblood.\\n\\nOn our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or\\nnew. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder\\nCapua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has\\nbeen chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the\\nhistoric traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at\\neither, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small\\nvalue in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.\\nIt is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,\\nto look again on the amphitheatre of Capua -- Capua, the mistress of\\nRome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of\\namphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,\\neven of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with\\na general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan\\namphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they\\nhardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far\\nless perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than\\nat Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman\\nColiseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,\\nwhile of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how\\nmuch is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the medi\\u00e6val\\nbarons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than\\nat Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up\\nfrom underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.\\nIf any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is\\nnot a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that\\nthe inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation\\nand enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems\\nto imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at\\nleast, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It\\nillustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the\\ntaste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.\\n\\nBesides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes\\nand designs which line the road -- one of which is indeed singularly\\nlike a model of an amphitheatre -- the true Capua has little to show\\nbesides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,\\none which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid\\nthan Rome, so utterly gone -- or rather to see the little that is left of\\nit translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we\\nbegin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,\\nremained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the\\nlast remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.\\nAs such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the\\ncity itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may\\nbe sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city\\nby the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian\\nriver, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni\\nand Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than\\nFlorence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking\\nof the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the arx of\\nCapua could have stood, if we are to understand by an arx something\\nset upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to\\nlater ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The\\nSamnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,\\nhad become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of\\nthe mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.\\n\\n \\\"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\\\"\\n\\nsays the line which comes as such a relief after the involved\\nconstructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as\\nsimply worded as it could be in a medi\\u00e6val chronicle, which gives us\\na true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without\\na single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was\\ndoubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,\\nwho had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment\\nto the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was\\nlargely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the\\nlarge amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any\\nmeasure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua\\nfor a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the\\nRoman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who\\nfilled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once\\nmore a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came\\nnot as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,\\nand when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the\\nkeeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those\\nremnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the arx of Capua, are not\\nto be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his\\nfirst or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan\\n arx , he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their\\nlowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the\\nCampanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we\\ncome to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way\\nto a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan\\namphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of\\nTifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his\\ncamp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the\\nholy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain\\nwhich rises above its massy tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.\\n\\n\\nWe reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching\\nof Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of\\nbeleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout\\nfighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his\\nlast hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the\\ndanger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in\\nsome tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks\\nwhich doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no\\nlake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend\\non Tifata as grew round -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nYet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent\\nforth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest\\nforms into which any kind of Italian or Hellenic worship strayed\\nmight well seem mild. In tracking the career of Hannibal, we are ever\\ndisappointed at the utter lack of means to call up a picture of the\\nman himself apart from his public acts. He had human weaknesses, for\\nhe found a mistress at Salapia. He had his sallies of merriment, for\\nhe could raise a laugh at the grave Gisgo. But the course of his inner\\nlife is hidden from us. Still we can at least see that he was, in his\\nown belief, charged with a mission from the gods of his own city. And\\nit needs an effort to bear in mind that the gods of Hannibal were Baal\\nand Moloch. The goddess to whom he would have reared a temple would\\nhave been, not a Diana, but an Ashtoreth. Yet, among the many, and\\nmostly false, charges of cruelty brought against the great Ph\\u0153nician\\nby Roman writers, we do not hear, as we do in the case of some other\\nCarthaginian commanders, of captives being made to pass through the\\nfire to the gods of Carthage. Hannibal, the friend of Capua, would at\\nCapua honour Diana of Tifata; but it was not Diana that had sent him.\\nWith what thanks did he honour his own gods, when Capua, second city\\nof all Italy, welcomed the victor of Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cann\\u00e6? Is\\nit too bold a flight to fancy the mount of Tifata the scene of the same\\nform of Baal-worship as the mount of Carmel?\\n\\nBut the gods of Italy lived on, undisturbed by the momentary presence\\nof Semitic rivals. Diana was not the only power worshipped on Tifata;\\nJupiter also had his holy place. And it may be that the venerable\\nchurch which now forms the chief attraction of the hill-side represents\\nthe holy place of Jupiter rather than the holy place of Diana. It is\\ncurious to see how a kind of appropriateness was often sought after in\\nthe nomenclature of Pagan temples when turned into Christian churches.\\nThus, at Athens, the Parthen\\u00f4n remained the Parthen\\u00f4n, while the temple\\nof the warrior Th\\u00easeus or H\\u00earakl\\u00eas became the church of the warrior\\nGeorge. We should look for a Santa Maria or a Santa Lucia at\\nthe least, on the site of the sanctuary of Diana. Had we here a San\\nPietro , we should have very little doubt in setting down the prince\\nof the Apostles as having supplanted the father of gods and men. But\\nat Sant' Angelo in Formis we feel somewhat less certain; St. Michael\\nsuggests the Norman, and the Norman has been there. It may well be that\\nthe name is no older than his day.\\n\\nBut St. Michael on the slope of Tifata did carry us back in thought to\\na church of St. Peter seen some months before under a widely different\\nstate of outward things. We then made a somewhat difficult journey to a\\ngreat and solitary Tuscan basilica in time of snow. The outward aspect\\nof nature had certainly changed a good deal between the bleak day in\\nJanuary when it was found a hard task to follow the way from Pisa to\\nthe basilica of the prince of the Apostles in Grado and the sunny day\\nin May when the same travellers found their way without difficulties of\\nany kind to the basilica of the prince of the archangels in Formis .\\nAnd there certainly can be no likeness of position, even if both were\\nseen in January or both in May, between the basilica standing low in\\nthe flats by the mouth of Arno and the basilica which nestles against\\nthe mountains which form a wall to the rich plain of Vulturnus. But\\nin seeing any one of these great churches, left, not ruined, like\\nour Cistercian abbeys, but still living on a kind of life in places\\nforsaken or nearly so, something always brings up the memory of some\\nother of its fellows. Aquileia is perhaps the greatest case of all; but\\nAquileia, with its special position in the history of the world, stands\\nby itself. If Aquileia itself is dead, it has lived on a wonderful\\nafter-life in the shape of its Venetian colony. We go to see Aquileia,\\nbecause it is Aquileia; but even a well-informed traveller may know\\nnothing of San Pietro in Grado and Sant' Angelo in Formis , till\\neither his guide-book or some earlier visitor points them out to him\\nas places which he ought not to pass by. Aquileia again has other\\nthings to show besides the great basilica and its surroundings. St.\\nApollinaris in Classe is as nearly forsaken as a church that is still\\nkept up can be; but the basilica of Classis does not stand by itself;\\nit forms part of the wonders of Ravenna, as St. Paul without-the-Walls\\nforms part of the wonders of Rome. St. Peter in Grado might be looked\\non as standing in the same relation to Pisa; but it hardly enters\\ninto our general conception of Pisa, as the church of Classis -- papal\\nhavoc hinders us from adding the church of C\\u00e6sarea -- certainly enters\\ninto our general conception of Ravenna. S. Angelo in Formis at all\\nevents does not enter into our general conception of old Capua, because\\nthere is not enough of old Capua left to form any general conception\\nof it at all. The church and the small surrounding village do form\\na kind of distant arx to the greater collection of houses which\\nsurrounds the amphitheatre; but among the nearer objects which catch\\nthe eye from the height, the most prominent is not old Capua with its\\namphitheatre, but new Capua, Casilinum that once was, with its towers\\nand cupolas, medi\\u00e6val and modern. We look on many things from the\\nterrace in front of the portico of the archangel, but that which among\\nartificial objects chiefly draws the eye towards it, is not the elder\\nCapua of Hannibal and Marcellus, but the Capua which succeeded Aversa\\nas the seat of the elder but the less famous of the Norman powers in\\nSouthern Italy. As we mark the advance of national union, no less than\\nas we mark the advance of mere dynastic aggression, we have sometimes\\nto think, for a moment perhaps to mourn, that \\\"kingdoms have shrunk\\nto provinces,\\\" though in this form of advance and incorporation, we\\nhave no longer to add that \\\"chains clank over sceptred cities.\\\" Capua,\\non both its sites, once the head of an Etruscan, once of a Norman\\ndominion, passed, in one age, under the universal rule of Rome. In\\nanother age it again sank from its separate headship to become a member\\nof that greater Norman dominion in Apulia and Sicily which, after\\nmore shiftings, unions, divisions, transfers to distant rulers, than\\nany other part of Europe, has in our days been merged in the realm of\\nunited Italy, with Rome as its head, but not its mistress.\\n\\nWe reach then the height which, whether that of Jupiter or Diana of\\nold, is now the height of the warrior archangel. The whole history of\\nthe church belongs to the independent days of the second Capua; in its\\npresent shape it belongs to the days of independent Norman rule in the\\nsecond Capua. But the days of independent Norman rule were days when\\nthe arts of the earlier rulers of the land still lived on. We see signs\\nof the art of Byzantium, so long mistress of Southern Italy, and of\\nthe art of the Saracen, in Italy only a visitor or an invader, while in\\nSicily an abiding master. The portico in front of the church is Roman\\nin its general idea; but, instead of the colonnade and entablature\\nof the Laurentian basilica, we see an arcade whose pointed arches at\\nonce call up memories of Sicily. They have indeed little of Sicilian\\ngrace. Nowhere at Palermo or Monreale do we see such massive columns\\nbearing such massive stilts. Columns indeed we should hardly say, as\\nsome of them are plainly mere fragments. But here, just as in Sicily,\\njust as in Aquitaine, the pointed arch is no sign of coming Gothic;\\nthe style is still wholly Romanesque, and somewhat rude Romanesque\\ntoo. And in this region of Italy we can hardly doubt as to attributing\\nthe almost accidental shape of the arches to the influence of Saracen\\nmodels, perhaps to the workmanship of Saracen craftsmen. Hard by, but\\nnot joining the building, by an arrangement unlike Sicily, unlike\\nApulia, but the common rule of Northern Italy, rises a bell-tower,\\nor rather the beginning of a bell-tower, which raises our wonder as\\nto what it would have been if it had ever grown to its full height.\\nTwo stages only are finished, the lower of hewn stone, the upper of\\nbrick; but their bulk is so great that the tower, if it had ever been\\nfinished, would surely have ranked among the highest of its class,\\nutterly overpowering even the great basilica at its side, except so\\nfar as it would have been itself overpowered by the natural heights\\nabove it. As in some other cases, the thought suggests itself, were not\\nthose who left off building the tower wiser than those who began it?\\nThe tall bell-towers of Italy look well as they rise from the Lombard\\nplain, as they crown the hill of Fiesole, as they skirt the shores of\\nthe lake of Como. But we are not sure that a gigantic tower, which, if\\nit was to have any kind of proportion, ought to have been carried up\\nto a height as great as that of Venice, was in its right place when\\nset a little way up a mountain-side, as if simply to show how small\\nman's biggest works look in the midst of the works of nature. But the\\ntechnical eye is thankful for the fragment that has been built, though\\nmainly on a very technical ground. Professor Willis is gone, but his\\nhappy phrase of mid-wall shafts has not died with him. The custom\\nof the elder Romanesque towers, the abiding fashion of Germany and\\nNorthern Italy, was to set the little columns which divided the coupled\\nwindows in the very middle of the wall; the latter Norman fashion,\\nwhether in Normandy, in England, or in Apulia, was to set them nearly\\nflush with the outer wall. In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman\\nby allegiance, two sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman\\nfashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters\\nof detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious\\nthought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise\\nbetween two rival forms of taste.\\n\\nThe outside of this church, except so far as it forms an object in\\nthe general landscape, is perhaps chiefly attractive to the technical\\nobserver; the inside will surely appeal to every visitor, though the\\nvisitor who is technically informed in matters of painting may possibly\\nlook upon it with more of curiosity than of positive admiration. But\\nthe eye of the more general inquirer will give something like positive\\nadmiration to a basilica of eight arches, resting on ancient columns\\nof various marbles, with its original design far less damaged than is\\ncommon in Italian churches, and with every inch of available space\\ncovered with elaborate paintings of the date of the building. Like\\nSt. Peter by Pisa, the archangel by Capua trusted to painting for his\\nenrichment and not to mosaics; and though the Campanian pictures are by\\nfar the better preserved of the two, though nearly all the subjects can\\nbe made out with the greatest ease, yet Ravenna and Venice rise to the\\nmind to make us think that at least if endurance be the object, there\\nis a more excellent way.\\n\\nThe walls of this church form almost a pictorial Bible, with a few\\nlegendary and local subjects thrown in. The Abbot Desiderius, holding,\\nafter the usual symbolical fashion, the church in his hand, is to be\\nseen at the east end along with the archangels and evangelists. At\\nthe west end is what connoisseurs tell us is one of the very earliest\\npictures of the Last Judgment. On the two sides a crowd of scenes and\\nfigures from the Old and New Testament cover the whole space. The style\\nof the painting is said to show Greek workmanship; we look toward the\\nwest end and mark, hardly above the ground, a single small shaft with\\na capital of strictly Byzantine character. The ruling Norman seems on\\nthis spot to have pressed into his service the artistic powers of all\\nthe inhabitants of the peninsula. Italian, Greek, Saracen, all give\\ntheir help to adorn the house of the archangel. The Norman himself\\ncontributes nothing but the position of two small columns in the tower\\nwindows. We cannot even attribute to him the position of the house of\\nthe archangel, set Norman-fashion in a high place; for the first church\\nwas built before the Norman came. It is not so further east, where a\\ndistinctively Norman element is to be seen in the great churches of\\nApulia. But the gathering together of the best skill of the time from\\nall quarters is a thoroughly Norman function, whether in Italy or in\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe basilica should be compassed, so far at least as to climb the\\nhill a little way to look at its east end. Its surrounding buildings\\nsupply an arch or two to catch the eye on the way up or down. But the\\nessential features of Sant' Angelo are the grand display of painting\\nand the union of elements of so many kinds. It is the first of a great\\nseries of churches at which our course will bid us to stop here and\\nthere. But before we reach them we shall pass by one point where our\\nmusings will again be mainly secular and largely pagan. A short journey\\nwill lead us from Campania into Samnium, and the valiant men of the\\nSamnite land will claim a tribute on a spot which is Samnite beyond all\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. A Glimpse of Samnium.\\n\\n\\nFrom Caserta and what is to be seen from Caserta, our next journey lies\\nby the line of railway which runs right across Italy, connecting the\\ntwo great lines of the east and west of the peninsula. It leads us from\\nthe Campanian plain, with at least its sheltering wall of mountains,\\nwith Tifata to guard the great city that once was from the ruder land\\nbeyond, to the great plain of Apulia from which every feature of a\\nmountain-land has passed away. But, in so crossing from one side of\\nItaly to the other, we pass through a striking and an historic region.\\nWe are in the land of the mightiest Italian rivals of Rome, the land\\nof those with whom Rome had to fight, before Pyrrhos and Hannibal came,\\nand ages after Pyrrhos and Hannibal were gone.\\n\\nOur course leads us into the heart of the Samnite land, a land which\\nmay well call up endless musings on the hard fate of those \\\"hearts of\\nsteel\\\" who bore up so long against Rome, in the days when Rome was\\nreally at her greatest. And the memories of the same land in after\\ndays are not wholly alien to those of earlier times. Our course brings\\nus, at not a few points, across the memories, if not of nations, yet\\nof men, who had to bear up against the power of Rome, when the power\\nof Rome had taken a far other form than that of the senate and the\\narmies against which the Samnite had to strive. For the old Samnite\\nland holds its place in later story, as the land of princes who felt\\nwhat the spiritual Rome could do when the powers of the spiritual\\nRome were at their highest. We pass through regions which were the\\nscene of no small part of the history of the Norman and Swabian lords\\nof Sicily and Southern Italy. We are deep in the land of the counts,\\ndukes, kings, and emperors of the house of Hauteville and the house\\nof Hohenstaufen; and we are often called on to stop and track out\\ntheir deeds. At not a few points do we light on some building, some\\ninscription, which brings up the memory of Frederick, the Wonder of\\nthe World, and of Manfred, whose field of overthrow we shall presently\\npass by. In both periods the history of these lands has a character\\naltogether different from that of Northern and Central Italy. In the\\nlater period this needs no proof: we are dealing with the history of\\na kingdom, not with the history of a system of separate cities. But\\nsomething of the same difference extends to the earlier period also. If\\nwe wish to know more of Volscians and Hernicans, yet more keenly do we\\nwish to know more of Samnites. The part which they played is greater,\\nat all events in scale, and their dealings with Rome belong to a stage\\nof Roman history when we feel that we have a kind of right to know\\nmore than we could hope to know in the earlier time. But while we know\\nsomething of the character of the Samnite people as a whole, while we\\nknow something -- though much less than in some other Italian lands -- of\\nthe geography of the Samnite country, we have no clear notion of the\\npolitical position or the political action of any particular Samnite\\ncity or canton, such as we ever and anon do get of particular cities\\nof Etruria and Latium. And again, it is seldom that we can call up\\nany distinct personal conception of any Samnite leader as a living and\\nbreathing man. This is indeed a grievance which affects Samnites along\\nwith the other Italian enemies of Rome. The personal conceptions which\\nwe do get of Etruscans and Latins largely belong to legendary times. Of\\nhistorical Volscians we know very few. And we have already complained\\non Hernican ground that we cannot picture to ourselves the personal\\nlikeness of any single Hernican of independent Hernican days.\\n\\nStill, on this particular journey we have small right to complain;\\nfor we pass by the spot which calls up the memories of the most\\nmemorable Samnites of whom we have any personal knowledge. They are\\nmen of one name, most likely therefore of one house, and men of whom\\nwe emphatically wish to know more than we do know. Leaving Caserta\\nbehind, glancing at the Campanian plain and the Campanian mountains,\\nmarking Naples only by the smoke of the distant city, we pass along\\nthrough what, in our simplicity, we take to be the vale of Vulturnus,\\ntill we light on a more classical friend, armed with a more classical\\nmap, who explains that the stream which we are tracing is in strictness\\nnot Vulturnus himself, but only his tributary Calor. Anyhow we go\\nalong its course into the heart of the Samnite land, and we pass by\\none spot -- a spot which we ought to have treated better than merely to\\npass it by, a spot round which the greatest memories of Samnite history\\ngather, and where they strangely interweave themselves with wholly\\ndifferent memories of the history of our own land. We reach Telesia,\\nthe home of the Pontii, and we remember that Telesia was also for a\\nmoment the home of Anselm. Our guide-book provokingly fails us; but\\nthe large building on the hill-side must surely be the monastery where\\nhe sojourned. There are Roman antiquities in the place; for Samnite\\nantiquities we do not look. But did Samnites build no walls, or do the\\nmighty bulwarks of Cori and Segni mark an earlier state of things than\\nthe Sabellian occupation of Southern Italy? Anyhow, we are here at the\\nplace which has attached itself as a surname to the two most memorable\\nmen in the scanty personal history of Samnium. Here, on his own\\nground, we remember that Gaius Pontius who spared Rome's army at the\\nCaudine Forks, and who lived to be led, twenty-seven years later, as a\\nspectacle in a Roman triumph, to end his days, one might almost say as\\na martyr, by the axe of the headsman in a Roman dungeon. So we used to\\nread the tale in our youth; so moralized the historians of our youth\\nover the special baseness which handed over such a man to such an end.\\nOr are we to adopt the new reading of the tale which at least saves\\nQuintus Fabius Maximus from that special stain of blood-guiltiness\\nwhich cleaves to the canonized memory of Divus Julius? It may be\\nwell if we can believe that one of the worthiest heroes of the old\\ncommonwealth, if he could not forestall the magnanimity of Pompeius and\\nAurelian, at least did not sink to the special and petty spite of the\\nmurderer of Vercingetorix. We are now taught that the Gaius Pontius\\nwho appears twenty-seven years after the first mention of that name,\\nis most likely not the same man as the merciful victor of the Caudine\\nForks. If this be so, then Quintus Fabius, in consigning his Pontius\\nto the axe, merely conformed to the cruel custom of his nation, without\\nthe further aggravation of slaying in cold blood one who had dealt with\\nRome so nobly. And after all some might hint that the oldest Pontius\\nof all was the wisest. It may be that the sage old father of Gaius\\nknew human nature best, when he bade his son either to massacre the\\nwhole Roman army or else to let them go free without terms. It may be\\nthat the son chose a more dangerous path than either, when he took to\\ndiplomacy and middle courses.\\n\\nBut if the earlier Pontius of Telesia should prove -- though the guess\\nis a simple guess -- to be in truth two Pontii, perhaps a father and a\\nson, no doubt seems to have fixed itself on the identity of the last\\nPontius at the Colline gate of Rome. The rising again of Samnite life\\nat the last moment of all, when the war with the allies seemed to have\\nlost itself in the deeper whirlpool of the war of Marius and Sulla,\\nis really the most striking thing in the whole history, such as we\\nhave it, of the Samnite people. We are taken by surprise when, in\\ndays when Rome already seems the fully established head, not only of\\nItaly, but of all the Mediterranean world, her power, her very being,\\nis threatened by the leader of a nation which seemed to have been dead\\nand buried for some centuries. But, just like the Volumnian tomb in\\none way, so the Samnite resurrection in another way is a witness to\\nthe real life which the other states of Italy kept on under a form\\nof Roman dominion which made them externally dependent, which threw\\nits influence into the scale of oligarchy in their external affairs,\\nwhich ever and anon subjected them to some irregular demand, but which\\nleft the general course of their lives to be whatever they themselves\\nchose it to be. In the days of Marius and Sulla, Etruscans and Samnites\\nwere still Etruscans and Samnites; they had not become Romans, nor had\\nthey merged their being in any common name of Italians. The Social War\\nitself was the first attempt at forming a general Italian nationality.\\nBut the last campaign of the last Pontius shows how deep, in Samnite\\nhearts at least, was the earlier feeling, the feeling which knew\\nno greater whole than the federal union of Etruria or Samnium. It\\nshows too how specially deep was the feeling of hatred for the single\\ncity which had brought down so many cities and leagues to become its\\nhelpless dependents. Against Pontius at the Colline gate Rome fought\\nfor life, as she had never fought since the old days when she had to\\nguard herself against enemies who lived within sight of her capitol.\\nForeign invaders, Pyrrhos, Hannibal himself, did not come with the\\nsame fixed purpose of rooting up the wood which sheltered the wolves of\\nItaly. We can hardly doubt that it is the hand of Sulla which from that\\nday to this has hindered the south of Italy from being like the north.\\nBut the blow which crushed the Samnite people as the other nations of\\nItaly were not crushed, was vengeance taken for a moment when it once\\nmore became a question whether Rome should rule over Italy, whether\\nRome should exist at all.\\n\\nAt Telesia we look out, and muse on what might have been, if one\\nPontius had done otherwise than he did by the forks of Caudium, if\\nanother Pontius had fared otherwise than he fared at the gates of\\nRome herself. At our next halting-place we are called on, not to muse\\non what might have been, but on what was. At Beneventum we tread the\\nbattle-ground of Pyrrhos and Manfred, the ground of two of the greatest\\nvictories of the Rome of the earlier and the Rome of the later day.\\nThere we need not strive to call up the dim figures of men, like the\\nolder and the later Pontius, known by one action of their lives. The\\nEpeirot and the Swabian stand out as clearly discerned figures in the\\nhistory of their several ages. And the places where we next halt will\\nshow us the place of overthrow for both, the place of death and utter\\nruin for one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Benevento.\\n\\n\\nWe follow the stream of Calore till we reach a city which, without\\never having been one of the great cities of the world, without having\\nbeen even one of the greatest cities of Italy, has always kept up an\\nimportant historic being. Beneventum is a familiar name in all ages;\\nyet Beneventum has never been either a mighty commonwealth like Venice\\nor Genoa, or the head of a mighty kingdom like Naples and Palermo.\\nIt has had its princes; if we never heard of them before, we should\\nlearn a good deal of them by studying the monuments of their city.\\nThat is to say, the monuments will tell us a great deal about princes\\nnine hundred or a thousand years back; no monument that we remember in\\nBenevento tells us anything about the last prince who bore their title.\\nLet us suppose a wanderer who began his travels at Autun and who finds\\nhimself, in the course of the same wandering, at Benevento. He will\\nfeel it as a grotesque coincidence that, not so very long ago, a man\\nwas living who had once been Prince of Benevento and who before that\\nhad been Bishop of Autun. Benevento, among many other things that it\\nis, is also the later city of Talleyrand, as Autun is the earlier. But\\nthere is this difference that one thinks of Talleyrand at Autun and one\\ndoes not think of him at Benevento. At Autun he has his place, though\\na very strange place, in the long succession of Bishops of Autun; at\\nBenevento, though he bore the style of its prince, he stands all alone;\\nwe cannot find a niche for him in the succession of the Beneventan\\nprinces. Yet a prince of Benevento whose existence marks the ending\\nfor a season of the long papal dominion in Benevento reminds us that\\nBenevento had its princes before that papal dominion began. It reminds\\nus of the two distinctive features in the later history of the city.\\nBenevento was first the seat of Lombard princes who, placed on the\\nborders of both empires, contrived to escape all practical submission\\nto either; it was then the seat of an outlying scrap of papal dominion\\nsurrounded on all sides by the Sicilian realm. In both these characters\\nBenevento was a kind of curiosity on the historical map of Europe. But\\nthe city had its ups and downs before those days, and amongst other\\nthings it had gone through a somewhat grotesque change of name. It is\\nhard to believe that a city placed so far inland can really have been\\nof Greek origin; but legend attributed it to a Greek founder, and its\\noldest name had a Greek sound. Greek Maloeis , Samnite Maluentum ,\\nhad, when it was read into Latin Maloventum , an ill sound; so, when\\nthe Samnite stronghold was changed into the Roman colony, it took the\\nname of Beneventum, city of welcome.\\n\\nBeneventum, marked by Procopius as a strong city in a high place,\\nstands low as compared with the true hill-cities. Still, as compared\\nwith Capua, it might itself pass for a hill-city. It has just that\\namount of rise above the river which there commonly is where there is a\\nriver, such a rise as may be seen in many an English town which is not\\nas Durham or Lincoln. We miss the prim\\u00e6val walls of the hill-cities;\\nbut we find, on the other hand, works of Roman and medi\\u00e6val art such as\\nin the hill-cities we do not find. The arch of Trajan has vanished from\\nRome, except so far as it lives in the sculptures which were torn from\\nit to enrich the arch of Constantine. But at Benevento, as at Ancona,\\nthe memorial of the conqueror of Dacia still abides. The Beneventan\\narch may indeed fairly take its place in the Roman series. It belongs\\nessentially to the same class of designs as the arch of Severus and\\nthe arch of Constantine, while it has little in common with its own\\ntall and slender fellow at Ancona. At the same time, since it has, in\\ngeneral effect at least, taken upon itself something of the position\\nof a town-gate, since it bears the name of Porta aurea , to match the\\ngolden gate of Constantinople and the golden gate of Spalato, the arch\\nof Beneventum has now a somewhat greater air of reality than triumphal\\narches commonly have. The weak point of that class of structures\\nis that they are of no use. They do not, like a wall, a gateway, a\\nhouse, a temple, a hall of council, serve any purpose in the ordinary\\neconomy of things. They are purely monumental, set up to commemorate\\nsomething or somebody, but in no way to help on men's daily affairs,\\npublic or private. And yet they are not mere monuments, like a statue\\nor an inscribed stone. A large building of this kind, having very\\nmuch the air of a building which does serve some purpose, is a little\\ndeceptive. It is so like a real gateway that it calls up the thought\\nof a real gateway, and leaves us a little disappointed at finding that\\nthe building, after all, never was of any use to anybody, and was set\\nup simply to be looked at. There is, therefore, something a little\\nunsatisfactory in the whole class of triumphal arches, and it may even\\nbe that a slightly ludicrous element is thrown in when we find that the\\nimmediate occasion for rearing this record of the life and exploits\\nof the \\\"fortissimus princeps\\\" whom it commemorates was the repair of\\nthe Appian Way. But it does not become us to find fault with any built\\nand graven monument, specially with one of a time of which we have so\\nfew written monuments as the memorable reign of Trajan. We are so much\\nthe slaves of accidental associations, so apt to draw lines at some\\naltogether unreasonable point, that we may doubt whether the reign of\\nTrajan holds the place which it should hold in popular imagination.\\nSuetonius wrote the lives of Twelve C\\u00e6sars, and this mere accident has\\ncaused the notion of a break which has no real existence between the\\nSuetonian Twelve and those who next followed them. The reign of Trajan\\nmarks the Empire at its highest pitch of extent and power, at that\\nhighest pitch which, in its own nature, comes just before the beginning\\nof decay. His days saw, too, the highest pitch of architectural\\nmagnificence; and with Tacitus and Juvenal to adorn it, one might be\\ninclined to say that, as an age of Latin literature, the age of Trajan\\nmight hold its own against any earlier period of the Imperial rule. For\\nwe must remember that the great writers of the early days of Augustus\\nare in truth writers of the republican period living on into the\\nEmpire. The Flavian period, continued under Trajan, is quite as rich as\\nthe earlier days of the Empire itself. And we may notice that the arch\\nof Beneventum marks the reign of Trajan, and with it the Roman Empire,\\nat what was really its highest point. It was raised at a time when it\\ncould commemorate conquered Dacia and tributary Armenia. That Dacia and\\nArmenia could be brought within the range of that Roman world which is\\ncontinued in the system of modern Europe is proved by daily witnesses.\\nBut the arch of Beneventum was built too early to commemorate its\\nhero's later victories in the further East, momentary victories in\\nlands which neither Alexander nor Trajan could bring within the abiding\\nrange of Western influences.\\n\\nThe arch of Trajan is so distinctly the most famous thing in Benevento\\nthat it has carried us out of all chronological order. But the\\nhistorical interest of Beneventum lies earlier and later than Trajan's\\nday. In truth the Pax Romana forbade that the main interest of any\\nItalian city should lie in Trajan's day. We may believe or not as\\nwe please in the presence of Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas and \\u00c6neas; but Pyrrhos, Hanno,\\nTotilas, and Manfred are visitors who cannot be forgotten. The city\\nhas looked out on many battles, from the overthrow of the Molossian\\nto the overthrow of the Swabian. A pleasing tale in its history is\\nwhen that Tiberius Gracchus who is the first of a name to appear in\\nRoman history led back his victorious slave-soldiers to receive the\\nreward of freedom, and to be welcomed by the rejoicing people of the\\nfaithful colony. For among the Thirty Cities of those days, the Latin\\ncolony of Beneventum was not one of the laggard twelve, but one of\\nthe faithful eighteen that were ready to endure all hardships. In\\nlater warfare the city seems to have been less steadfast. It welcomed\\nBelisarius, and in after days Totilas took it without any trouble, and\\nif he destroyed the walls it was not out of revenge for any resistance\\non the part of its inhabitants, but for fear they should supply a post\\nof defence for an imperial army. But the greatest day of Beneventum as\\nan historical city comes later than Totilas and earlier than Manfred.\\nThe memory of that day may be studied in the chief remaining buildings\\nin the city, the two greatest churches and the castle. The west front\\nof the metropolitan church, a grand example of Italian Romanesque, is\\nfurthermore a perfect chronicle of local history. There we may read,\\nbuilt up into the wall, a crowd of monumental records of the Lombard\\nprinces of Beneventum, with their deeds, especially their dealings\\nwith the dangerous power of the Franks, set forth at length. The\\nbronze doors are famous, with their long array of Scriptural subjects\\nending in a lesson in the ecclesiastical geography of the province,\\nthe figures of the Archbishop of Beneventum and his suffragans. The\\nharmony of the front is a little marred by the single low and massive\\ncorner-tower; but the inscription sums up the history of Beneventum,\\npolitical and physical, for some ages. The city was laid waste by the\\nEmperor Frederick in 1229 and by an earthquake in 1688. The tower was\\nbuilt after the first overthrow in 1279; it was restored after the\\nsecond in 1690. Destruction wrought by the elements would thus seem\\nto be more easily repaired than destruction wrought by the hand of\\nC\\u00e6sar. But it is somewhat strange to find Frederick, in his own belief\\na successor of Trajan, a follower of Trajan in Eastern conquests,\\nbranded as a destroyer in the city where Trajan's memory is cherished.\\nBut Frederick had to deal with a kind of power which Trajan knew not.\\nThe wrath of the later Emperor fell on a city which was too faithful\\nto the Roman Bishop. The course of Trajan's rule was not likely to be\\ninterfered with either by the obscure chief of the persecuted Christian\\nsect, or by any minister of the creed of which Trajan was himself chief\\nPontiff.\\n\\nWithin the church the repairs done after the earthquake have wrought a\\ngood deal of mischief. But we can still see the four ranges of columns\\nof a mighty basilica which must once have taken its place among the\\nnoblest of its class. Their capitals are a little nondescript; but\\nthey do not offend the eye; if they were certified to be of Trajan's\\nday, it would doubtless be the right thing to admire them. The ambones\\nand the Easter-light are lovely work of the early fourteenth century,\\nthe days of a real Renaissance , truer than that which followed. The\\ntreasury is rich in vestments and other precious things; but the reader\\nof Anselm's Life looks in vain for that specially gorgeous vestment\\nwhich a Beneventan Archbishop of the eleventh century bore away from\\nCanterbury in exchange for the arm of St. Bartholomew, and which made\\nits wearer the most splendid object among the assembled fathers at\\nBari. If this missing garment carries our thoughts to England, the\\nround church of St. Sophia -- hexagonal in its inner range -- carries us\\nto the Eastern world, and reminds us that there was more than one line\\nof successors of Trajan, and that Beneventum came under the influences\\nof both. The cloister, with its amazing series of capitals, its birds,\\nits elephants, its hunting scenes, may rank with those of Aosta and of\\nArles, of which that of Aosta can supply camels to match the Beneventan\\nelephants. The castle dates only from Pope John the Twenty-second, far\\naway at Avignon; we look perhaps more carefully at the older fragments\\nbuilt up in its walls and on the lion in front of it. With the lion\\nin our thoughts we may look out for other beasts, graven or molten\\nor abiding in their own relics. Procopius saw there the tusks of the\\nKalydonian boar, as in later times he might, either at Warwick or at\\nBristol, have seen the ribs of the dun cow. It is for pal\\u00e6ontologists\\nto say what it was that the Beneventan antiquaries really showed\\nhim. Failing this natural wonder we go to pay our respects to another\\nbeast whose shape is due to man's device, in quite another part of the\\ncity. A rudely carved bovine animal, in which local patriotism sees\\nthe Samnite bull -- the bull which, on the coins of revived Samnium, so\\nproudly trampled down the Roman wolf -- is now cruelly to be ruled as\\nnothing better than a monument of intruding Apis-worship. We have less\\ntime to spend at Benevento than at some other cities; but the Roman\\narches and vaults of the strange building called Quaranta Santi ,\\nthe grand Roman bridge below, must not be forgotten, and we must still\\ngive one more thought to the two mighty men whose hopes were shattered\\nat Beneventum. Manfred fell with his faithful Saracens around him;\\nPyrrhos lived to fall by a meaner end at Argos; but Beneventum ended\\nthe real career of both. It is strange how the two were in some sort\\nthe converse of each other. Pyrrhos carried the Epeirot arms into\\nSicily and southern Italy; Manfred, lord of Sicily and southern Italy,\\nestablished a Sicilian dominion on the coast of Epeiros. Korkyra,\\nCorfu, the island which has seen every master except the Turk, formed\\npart of the dominions of both alike. We leave Benevento for another\\ncity in which the East and the West of Europe, and a crowd of other\\nelements besides, meet yet more closely than they do at Benevento.\\nAt Beneventum the eye of Horace began to be caught by the well-known\\nmountains of Apulia; Procopius somewhat boldly speaks of inland\\nBeneventum as being opposite to Dalmatia. The city which we take as\\nour next chief goal, if not strictly opposite to Dalmatia, is so marked\\nas being opposite to one Illyrian port as to have sent its name, so to\\nspeak, across the Hadriatic. We will not trouble ourselves to look out\\nfor Equotuticum, or to regale ourselves with either the bread or the\\nwater of Canusium. It is to the walls of Bari, fishy Bari, that we have\\nto make our way; at Bari, Greek, Latin, Saracen, even Englishman, are\\nall at home, and Bari is opposite to Antivari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Norman Buildings in Apulia.\\n\\n\\nAt Foggia the line of railway which crosses the Italian peninsula\\nfrom Naples eastward joins the great European line which for the most\\npart skirts the Western Hadriatic shore. From Rome itself the iter\\nad Brundisium is still made by way of Beneventum; for the great mass\\nof mankind Bologna has in this matter supplanted Beneventum and Rome\\ntoo. Our eastward course across the peninsula has done for us much the\\nsame as would be done by the like course across our own island. We have\\nundergone the same change as if we had passed from Wales, Devonshire,\\nor Cumberland, to Lincolnshire or East-Anglia. We need no longer\\nlook out for hill-cities, where the first element in such cities, the\\nhills themselves, is not to be found. At Foggia we have not even the\\namount of hill which we have at Benevento. We are in the great Apulian\\nplain, the plain so precious for sheep-feeding, and the occupation of\\nwhich has more than once given rise to wars and treaties. Of Foggia\\nitself many perhaps have never heard except as a railway junction.\\nYet Foggia has a history, and its history has monuments, though we\\ncan hardly put them on a level with the monuments and the history of\\nBeneventum. The capital of Apulia, the representative of ancient Arpi,\\nhas a history in some respects the same as that of Beneventum, in some\\nother respects its opposite. Both cities claimed Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas as a founder,\\nwhile Frederick the Second, a destroyer at Benevento, appears as a\\nlater founder at Foggia. One arch of his palace still remains, with an\\ninscription telling us how under him Foggia became a royal and Imperial\\nseat. There died his English Empress Isabel, on the splendour of whose\\npassage on her way to her marriage our own historians are eloquent.\\nFurther than this, the monumental attractions of Foggia hardly go\\nbeyond what is left of its chief church. Of its front Gsell-fels, gives\\na somewhat ideal engraving, showing it, not as it is, but as it was\\nbefore earthquakes and restorers after earthquakes had combined to mar\\nit. It was -- indeed, with all mutilations, it still is -- a fine front\\nof the later Italian Romanesque, with one of the rose or wheel windows\\nwhich we must now look for wherever we go. More attractive perhaps is\\nthe crypt, with its four columns and capitals of singular beauty. They\\nsurely belong to the time of the Imperial patron of Foggia, marking as\\nthey do a kind of earlier and more healthy Renaissance , which, taking\\nclassical form as its general models, took them only as general models,\\nand did not deem itself bound slavishly to copy every turn of a leaf\\nor every section of a moulding. Such works of the carver's tool are\\nakin to those noble coins of Frederick which seem ages in advance of\\nanything that bore the image and superscription of his grandfather.\\n\\nFoggia is however less likely to strike the traveller -- at least\\nthe traveller who comes from the hill-towns by way of Capua and\\nBenevento -- by any remarkable store of ancient monuments, than as\\nbeing the first to which he will come of a series of cities, most of\\nwhich at once impress the visitor by their air of modern progress and\\nprosperity. The heel of Italy, in its cities at least, certainly seems\\nto be the very opposite to a decaying region, or even to a region which\\nstands still. To be sure, the city whose name is the most familiar\\nof all is something of an exception; Brindisi, notwithstanding its\\ndealings with the whole world, is not as Bari or even as Trani. But\\nmost of the towns at which we tarry, or which we pass by, give quite a\\ndifferent impression. We cannot tarry at all. At Barletta we get only\\na glimpse of the Imperial colossus, and therefore we do not venture\\nto hazard a guess whether it is Heraclius or any later prince whom it\\nrepresents. Along this coast, any C\\u00e6sar of the East is in his place,\\nif only as a memorial of the long, though half forgotten, time when\\nSouthern Italy bowed to the New Rome and not to the Old. But we do\\nnot let these earlier memories wholly shut out the thought of the\\nlater combat when the Horatii and Curiatii of legend found themselves\\nmultiplied by a process exactly opposite to decimation. The attractions\\nof Trani are irresistible; a bell-tower rising as proudly over the\\nwaves as that of Spalato itself would force us to halt even if we knew\\nnothing before of what church and city has to show us. The metropolitan\\nchurch of Trani is certainly one of the very noblest examples of that\\nsingular mixture of Norman and more strictly Italian forms -- not without\\na touch both of the Greek and the Saracen -- which is the characteristic\\nstyle of this region, the natural result of its political history.\\nStrange, but striking in the extreme, is the effect of the east end\\nof this church rising close above the sea; far more truly admirable\\nis the effect of the inside, where the coupled columns of the Saracen\\nhave been boldly taught to act as the piers of the great arcades,\\nand to bear up above them a massive triforium, which by itself would\\nmake us think ourselves in Normandy or England. All the churches of\\nthis district have a good deal of their strength underground, and the\\nunder-church of Trani is worthy of the building which it supports.\\nThe smaller church, All Saints', a charming little basilica with a\\nportico of singular grace, as also several good pieces of domestic\\narchitecture, and the general effect of the tower skirted with its\\ndark arcades, all join to make Trani a place which cannot be passed\\nby, though no august form calls on us, as at Barletta, to tarry to\\npay C\\u00e6sar his due homage. But Trani has found something to be said for\\nitself both by pen and by pencil in quite other company. An accident of\\nlater times gave it a right to rank, like Brindisi itself, among the\\nSubject and Neighbour Lands of Venice. And Trani has peculiarities of\\nits own. The main features of the style may be studied elsewhere. We\\nlong to see Barletta, to tarry to pay C\\u00e6sar his due. We long to stop at\\nBisceglia and Molfetta, of which we read attractive notices; but again\\nwe must pick and choose, and Bitonto is the only place on which we can\\nqualify ourselves to speak at all at large, till we come to the head of\\nthe whole region at Bari.\\n\\nBitonto shares a station with San Spirito, but it lies further away\\nfrom the railway, and that on the inland side, than most of the towns\\nalong this line. Its main interest is found in its cathedral church,\\nwhich in some points prepares us for the buildings of Bari. First\\nof all in point of wonder, though latest in point of date, is the\\ntreatment which it has undergone at the hands of modern improvers.\\nA dim remembrance comes to us that we saw something of the same kind\\nin the Dominican church at Perugia; otherwise we ask in amazement why\\nany man should think it an improvement to cut off the whole upper part\\nof a church as seen inside by thrusting in a roof a great deal lower\\nthan the original one, and thereby leaving the upper stages outside\\nto stand up in the air, serving no kind of purpose. Yet this has been\\ndone both at Bitonto and at Bari. Yet perchance the improvers of modern\\ntimes might retort on the original architects, and ask why, when they\\nhad made three apses at the east end, they presently built up a wall\\nto hide them. This is the arrangement both at Bitonto and in the two\\ngreat churches of Bari. The notion of Normans working in Italy would\\nalmost seem to have been to make an Italian front at one end, and\\nsomething approaching to a Norman front at the other end. Thus the\\nchurch of Bitonto has an excellent west front of Italian outline, with\\ndetails more Italian than Norman, and with the characteristic round\\nwindow evidently designed from the beginning, though the one which is\\nactually there must be of later date. Also there either has been or has\\nbeen meant to be a portico over the lower stage of the west front, a\\nthoroughly Italian notion. But the east end takes almost the form of\\na Norman west front; a Norman founder, it would seem, was not happy\\nunless he could somewhere or other get two towers with an ornamental\\nwall between them. To this end the apses are sacrificed. Instead of\\nthe three curved projections which form the main features of so many\\nItalian, German, and indeed Norman, east ends, the whole east end is\\nflat. The side apses are disguised by towers, one only of which is\\ncarried up to any height, while the great apse is hidden by the wall\\nbetween the towers. Herein is the difference between Bitonto and Trani.\\nAt Trani there are no eastern towers, and the apses, though of amazing\\nexternal height and no less amazing slightness of projection, are still\\nreal apses with a real curve. At Bitonto no one could know from the\\noutside that there were any apses at all. As the ordinary ranges of\\narcades and windows are thus made impossible, the architect, like an\\nEnglish architect some generations later, threw his strength into a\\nsingle east window, and certainly made one as large and as rich as was\\npossible before the invention of tracery. An elaborate round-headed\\nopening is covered with rich devices, and has wonderful monsters to\\nbear up its side-shafts. This too is to be seen at Trani, and we shall\\ncome again to other examples at Bari. There is something very strange\\nin these attempts to reconcile the ideas of Normandy and of Italy in\\none building. But in these flat east ends the result is that we get\\nsomething which is certainly neither Italian nor Norman, and which can\\nhardly be approved according to any law of either reality or beauty.\\n\\nThe same spirit of compromise goes on in other parts. The endless\\ncolumns of the under-church supply a rich study of capitals, largely of\\nthe grotesque kind. Men, monkeys, the original ram's horn, leaves, the\\nImperial eagle -- better suited for the purpose than anything else -- all\\ndo duty as volutes. The columns in the upper-church too give another\\nrich collection of various kinds of human, animal, and vegetable forms.\\nBut here a soberer spirit reigns; though perhaps no one capital is\\nstrictly classical, yet the grotesque does not reign as it does below.\\nThree arches from columns, a solid block, three more arches from\\ncolumns, make up the nave. Over these Italian elements Norman taste\\nset a triforium; modern taste has hidden the clerestory. Outside, the\\nItalian has his way in the rich open arcades of the parapets and in\\nthe windows of various forms, filled, some of them, with that kind of\\npierced tracery which is neither Italian nor Norman, but distinctively\\nOriental, and which look as if they had come -- as they possibly may have\\ncome -- from a mosque.\\n\\nAltogether there is something singularly interesting in this mixture of\\nstyles -- more strictly this mixture of two varieties of the same style,\\nfor Italian and Norman Romanesque are after all members of one great\\nartistic family. Nothing of the kind happened in Sicily, where the\\nNorman kings simply set native craftsmen, Greek and Saracen, to build\\nfor them after their several native fashions. Here, in a land where\\nGreek and Latin elements were striving for mastery, where the Saracen\\nwas a mere occasional visitor, the Norman brought in the ideas of his\\nown land to make a new element. But, if nothing like this happened in\\nSicily, something a little like it did happen in England. There is no\\ndoubt that Norman architecture was influenced, though very slightly,\\nby the earlier native style of England, a rude imitation of Italian\\nmodels. That Norman architecture in Apulia should be far more deeply\\ninfluenced by the Italian models themselves was but carrying out the\\nsame general process, as was only natural, in a far greater degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Bari.\\n\\n\\nWe are now at Barium, Bari, the original Bari of the West, as\\ndistinguished from the Bari, Bar , Antibaris , Antivari , which\\nrepeats its name on the opposite coast. There we can now again, as we\\ncould have done seventy years back at Cattaro, land at a Montenegrin\\nhaven. The distinction between the two bearers of the name of Bari\\nimplies an association which is not out of place. The historic interest\\nof Bari gathers wholly round its connexion with the lands on the\\nother side of Hadria. In earlier days the place has really no history\\nwhatever. Its most memorable day was when the powers of the Eastern\\nand Western Empires -- powers which perhaps never again worked in such\\nharmony -- were needed to dislodge a Saracen Sultan from its walls.\\n\\\"Emir,\\\" some one will say, not \\\"Sultan,\\\" and certainly we are more\\nused in Europe to Sultans of much later date than the days of Lewis\\nthe Second and Basil the First, Sultans coming from quite other lands\\nthan any that can have sent forth the Mussulman prince of Bari. But\\nhe is called Sultan as well as Emir by his one biographer, the Emperor\\nConstantine, and we cannot appeal from those august pages which still\\nform the best guide-book to the eastern shores of the Hadriatic.\\nAnyhow, the Sultan of Bari was a philosopher; he never laughed, except\\nonce when he saw a wheel go round; for that reminded him of the ups and\\ndowns of his own fortunes. Then Bari passes to the rule of the Eastern\\nEmpire; instead of a Sultan it has a Katapan, representative of the\\nEastern Augustus in that Italian dominion which had become so small\\nat the beginning of the ninth century, and which was so great again at\\nits end. Threatened again at the beginning of the eleventh century by\\nnew Saracen invaders, it is guarded by the fleets of Venice, still the\\nfaithful vassal of Constantinople against a common enemy. Seventy years\\nlater the arms of Robert Wiscard added the capital of Byzantine Italy\\nto his Norman dominion, and before the century was out, Pope Urban, the\\ngreat stirrer of the West against the Mussulman East, chose Bari as the\\nscene of the Council called to denounce at once the practical abuses of\\nthe Christian West and the dogmatic errors of the Christian East. Once\\nmore, in the next age, we find Bari looking across the sea to its old\\nlord, and chastised by the Sicilian king for its disloyalty. Add that\\nBari, before all saints, still honours St. Nicolas of the Lykian Myra,\\nand keeps his relics sacred, we are told, from Turkish desecration\\nby the craft of merchants of her own city. Altogether Bari seems, at\\nleast in its history, as much Greek as Italian or Norman. It would seem\\nneither unnatural nor unpleasant if Greek were still the tongue of the\\nseafaring folk of Bari, much as a Norman in his own land often carries\\nan air about him which would make Danish seem a much more natural\\nspeech for him than French.\\n\\nBut the great buildings of Bari belong to that mixed Norman and\\nItalian style of which we have already seen something at Bitonto. The\\narchitectural attractions of the city are chiefly to be found in two\\ngreat churches and one smaller one. The castle, standing by the sea,\\nshould have its landward side walked round, and the walk will reveal\\nmuch of picturesque outline and a little of good detail. But it is\\nthe churches, above all the great abbey of St. Nicolas, which are the\\nglory of Bari. They all lie in the old town by the sea, the old town\\nof narrow and crooked streets, in which it does not much matter which\\nway you go; you are sure to come either to the castle or to one of the\\nchurches before very long. Very different are things in the new town,\\nwhich we may rejoice in as we look at it as a sign of Bari's abiding\\nor renewed prosperity, but which can raise no feelings of pleasure on\\nany other ground. Its streets, crossing each other at right angles, are\\nindeed carefully dedicated to the worthies of Bari; but, unless we can\\nalways remember which of several perhaps not very familiar worthies\\nwatches over each of several angles which are exactly alike, it is\\neasy to take a wrong turn and to put oneself under the care of Andrew\\nof Bari when we ought rather to be commending ourselves to Robert.\\nAnd under either protection we yearn in the wide straight streets\\nfor some physical shelter from the Apulian sun, and wonder why modern\\nRome, modern Athens, and modern Bari should have so much less common\\nsense than Bologna, Padua, and Corfu had in days long past. Still,\\namid this rectangular labyrinth the sea is a help on one side, while\\non another the tall tower of the metropolitan church of St. Sabinus\\nbeckons us into the older streets, whose narrowness and crookedness\\nat least supply shade. That tower, one of the tallest and stateliest\\nof Italy, we naturally assume to be a detached campanile, without a\\nfellow and standing apart from its confederate buildings, church and\\nbaptistery. So it doubtless would be in a purely Italian city; but\\nhere we are in the city where the Norman displaced the Greek. The\\ntwo great churches of Bari, like that of Bitonto, have their towers\\nwrought into the building in Norman fashion, and at the duomo the\\ngreat round baptistery is also merged in the same mass with the church\\nand its towers. Both of the great churches of Bari have east ends\\nof the same kind as that at Bitonto; the apses are swallowed up; the\\nplace where the great apse should be is marked by a single splendid\\nRomanesque window. The eastern towers of St. Nicolas have never been\\ncarried up; at St. Sabinus the southern one has perished, but the\\nnorthern one still soars in all its majesty, thoroughly Italian in its\\nconception, but rather to be called Norman in its detail. St. Nicolas\\nhas also another pair of unfinished towers at its west end, standing\\nat once beyond the aisles as at Wells and Rouen, and in front of them\\nas at Holyrood. They flank a grand Italian front which one would think\\nwould be finer without them. These western towers are absent in the\\nmetropolitan church; but that has a most perfect octagonal cupola\\nover the crossing, the grouping of which with the two lofty eastern\\ntowers, if there was any point from which it could really be seen,\\nmust have been wonderful. Thus, in both churches, something of a German\\noutline has either been consciously brought in or has been incidentally\\nstumbled on. The four towers of St. Nicolas, the octagon and eastern\\ntower of St. Sabinus, will easily find Rhenish fellows, though we\\nshould perhaps have to go as far as Angoul\\u00eame for a single tower of\\nequal majesty mourning over a vanished brother. In other points the\\nexternal arrangements of the two great churches of Bari have much\\nin common. The rose windows, the coupled windows, the blank arcades,\\nare much the same in both. So is the choice of animal forms for the\\nfanciful supports of columns. In most places the lion discharges that\\nfunction -- in a building designed by lions we should doubtless see\\nsomething different. So we do here at Bari, where the solid forms of\\nthe pachydermata are, perhaps discreetly, preferred to the lighter\\n carnivora . The elephant, we think, is to be found in both churches,\\nand the huge earth-shaking beast is represented so as to remind us both\\nof Pyrrhos and of Hannibal; some have the smaller ear of India, some\\nthe larger of Africa. The hippopotamus appears only in the west front\\nof St. Nicolas. Had the daring shipfolk who bore away the saint's bones\\nfrom Lykia made their way to the Nile also?\\n\\nWhen we pass the threshold of the two buildings we see that their fate\\nin modern times has been very different. St. Sabinus has suffered much\\nas Bitonto has suffered. The upper part of the building is hidden\\nin just the same fashion, and ugly tricks have been played with the\\ncolumns and their capitals. St. Nicolas, on the other hand, has been\\nleft comparatively alone. The chief changes which it has undergone\\nmust have taken place not very long after the original building. The\\noriginal plan was much the same as that of Bitonto -- three arches from\\ncolumns, a massive pier, then three more arches from columns. But this\\narrangement was disturbed at an early time by throwing three spanning\\narches across the nave. The effect is so striking that we can hardly\\nregret their presence; but it is perfectly easy to see that they are\\ninsertions, and, though they are essentially of the same style, yet\\nthey differ in their details from the original columns. These last all\\napproach more or less to the Corinthian type; in the under-church the\\npatterns are more varied. Here are still the wonder-working relics of\\nSt. Nicolas, and the balsam or \\\"manna\\\" which flows from them may still\\nbe drunk. In the duomo the under-church has been restored out of all\\nancient character, but it still keeps an ancient Byzantine picture.\\n\\nAs so often happens, the secondary church of Bari altogether surpassed\\nthe mother church in historic fame and local honour. To ourselves the\\nfact in its history which comes home most nearly is that it was here\\nthat Urban held his Council, here that Anselm, to the satisfaction\\nof all Western minds, refuted the creed of the East, here that he\\ninterceded with the Pontiff and the assembled fathers on behalf of the\\nking who had wronged him. Here too it was that the keen eye of English\\nEadmer spied out on the shoulders of the Archbishop of Beneventum the\\nsplendid cope which is no longer to be seen at Beneventum. Such little\\ntouches in those days often brought the ends of the world together\\nin a way to which, in our days of more general intercourse, nothing\\nanswers. When French was the polite language alike at Dunfermline and\\nat Jerusalem, when the Latin-speaking clerk was at home in any corner\\nof the West, when the few men of the West who had learned Greek spoke\\nit so that a Greek could understand them, when men passed to and fro\\nbetween the civil services of England and Sicily, communication between\\ndistant parts of Europe was in some ways easier than it is now. Bari,\\none of the chief places for setting out on crusades, must for a long\\ntime have been a thoroughly cosmopolitan city. We do feel that the ends\\nof the earth have combined to meet at Bari, when we find the place\\nof honour in the church of St. Nicolas at Bari held by a princess of\\nBari, who became Queen of the greatest Slavonic kingdom. Emblematic\\nfigures of Bari and Poland support the tomb of Queen Bona, and her\\nepitaph describes her husband Sigismund, the first of that name, as not\\nonly the mighty King of Poland, but Grand-Duke of Lithuania, Russia,\\nPrussia, Mazovia, and Samogitia. Yet we might have lighted on Slavonic\\nassociations earlier on the road. There is a strange record of a\\nBulgarian settlement in the parts of Beneventum; but that would take us\\nyet further afield: it was before Bulgarians became Slavonic. But what\\nare we to say to the Samnite Schiavia which sheltered Anselm?\\n\\nThe journey is done -- \\n\\n\\\"Brundisium long\\u00e6 finis cart\\u00e6que vi\\u00e6que.\\\"\\n\\nOtranto lies yet further; but Otranto, yet more notably than Bari,\\ncomes within the Venetian Notitia . So does Brundisium, city of the\\nstag's horn, of the haven so aptly called, if we only knew in what\\ntongue it is that Brentesium has that meaning. But we are tempted\\nto regret that Brindisi and not Otranto is the point for which Hadria\\nhas to be crossed. Brindisi has no moral claim. We cannot look thence,\\nas we can from Otranto, upon the mountains of still enslaved Epeiros;\\nno one is tempted even to dream that he looks on free Corfu or on the\\nlesser satellite that stands in front as its outpost.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Freeman\\nPublisher: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS\\nPlace of publication: New York / London\\nDate: 1893\\n\\nArezzo.\\n\\n\\nThe city of M\\u00e6cenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,\\nshows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There\\nis some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,\\nand, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief\\nbuildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be\\nbought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among\\nthem surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that\\nclear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with\\nnourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different\\nways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having\\nyet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if\\nthe city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the\\nfirst rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both\\nforms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of\\nPisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect\\nof the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim\\na day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from\\nFlorence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.\\n\\nArezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities\\nwhich sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,\\nlike Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.\\nIt has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which\\npresently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself\\nin the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have\\nto be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect\\nof the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we\\ninstinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as\\na whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs\\nsome of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem\\nto borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it\\nwere covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several\\nsmall hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all\\nsides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast\\nsnowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the\\ncharacter of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a\\ngood deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a\\ngeneral view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to\\nthe left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must\\nclimb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean\\nfortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has\\ngardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about\\nat large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in\\nthe general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line\\nof the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except\\nwhere they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;\\nsurely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this\\nobject. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly\\ntheir whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit\\nit is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest\\nin some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show\\nside. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern\\nrailway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually\\ndescending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the\\ninhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from\\nopen fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it\\nis with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral\\nand the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without\\ntaking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of\\nArezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give\\nus either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of\\nmedi\\u00e6val towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect\\nin Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription\\nwhich illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed\\nsovereign Cosmo appears as \\\"Duke of Florence and Siena.\\\" He had\\ninherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;\\nmeanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the\\nhigher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\n\\nIn the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one\\ndominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral\\nchurch, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the\\ntown, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the duomo \\nis the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant\\nfeature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises\\namong a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of\\nthem, the great campanile of St. Mary della Pieve , though the body\\nof its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to\\nthe cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not\\nungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest\\narchitectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show\\nitself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and\\nthe town-tower, and that hard by the duomo ; but they do not hold,\\neven comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows\\nin the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a\\ncity which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical\\ncharacter was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of\\nArezzo, keeps -- though not on its old site -- his splendid tomb in the\\n duomo , on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles\\nwhich he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown\\nat his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of\\nhouses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building\\nbesides the churches is the front of that called the Fraternit\\u00e0 dei\\nLaici , in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of\\nArretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,\\nbut so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,\\nit contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show\\nin many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are\\nthe huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other\\nvast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.\\nNaturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones\\nwere no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as\\nrelics of the G\\u00e6tulian beasts of Hannibal.\\n\\nSomething may be picked up here and there in the other churches of\\nArezzo; but it is Santa Maria della Pieve which is the real object\\nof study. The duomo is absolutely without outline; it is a single\\nbody with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.\\nBut its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than\\nis common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the\\nGerman hand to which tradition attributes the building. The church of\\n La Pieve is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.\\nIts four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been\\nfinished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;\\nthe west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor\\nits defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which\\nnothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at\\nLucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column\\ncapitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its\\nlowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.\\nThe arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so\\nthey are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium\\nshows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The\\narches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well\\nas those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of\\nprodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is\\nquite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;\\nthe arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The\\nsouth side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:\\nbut it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient\\nbuilding on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the\\nwest front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished\\nfrom Arezzo. The \\\"Tyrrhena regum progenies\\\" have here left but small\\ntraces behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCortona.\\n\\n\\nFrom Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height\\n\\n ... Cortona lifts to heaven\\n Her diadem of towers.\\n\\nIf the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the\\nwalls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,\\nsuggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their\\nrace, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not\\nwin victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer\\nseems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with\\nClitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The\\njourney is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we\\nmight well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione\\nFiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern\\nhill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers\\na hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione\\ndistinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height\\nwhich it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.\\nWe have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the\\nheight, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and\\nCorinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of\\nthe younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,\\nas at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has\\nnever come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has\\nbecome at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas\\nis forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of\\nthe ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a\\ncity like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \\\"diadem\\nof towers\\\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of\\ntowers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any\\naccount in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make\\nup an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,\\nthere is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well\\nforsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the\\nplain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city\\nitself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it\\nthat we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site\\nitself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world\\nthat there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main\\ninterest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased\\nthat everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and\\nthat the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the\\nEtruscan walls.\\n\\nIn truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that\\nCortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had\\nfound only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which\\nlater times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost\\namong the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been\\ngreat in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little\\naccount that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the\\nground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just\\nat that time came its short period of anything like importance among\\nthe cities of medi\\u00e6val Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth\\ncentury, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.\\nYet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though\\nwe can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a\\ncity, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the\\nyounger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional\\nvisitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;\\nanother persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the\\nancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona\\nis emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own\\ncompany.\\n\\nAs an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,\\nthrough the regular stages of Roman colony and medi\\u00e6val commonwealth,\\nCortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of\\nits being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing\\nthat can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and\\nmonasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some\\ncontain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps\\nmarks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that\\nits cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.\\nThe duomo stands about half-way up the height within the town, on\\na corner of the walls. Its elegant Renaissance interior has been\\nalready spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building\\nthe columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper\\ncity where we should have looked for the duomo is occupied by the\\nChurch of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over\\nher portal as \\\"p\\u0153nitens Margarita,\\\" marked off thereby alike from\\nthe virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal\\nbuildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio\\nmust be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly\\ncoated as it is with the arms of successive podestas . Of private\\npalaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not\\non its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.\\nFrom the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the\\nacropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.\\nThe Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins -- not an\\nusual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its\\nditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed\\nfabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which\\nthe visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local\\nimportunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points\\nof view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done\\nfirst of all -- that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing\\nthat makes Cortona what it is.\\n\\nThe process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in\\nsome measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.\\nHappily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in\\nby far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan\\nrampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no\\nsmall height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,\\nbut still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood\\nin the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is\\nreason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must\\nremember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the\\ndays of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman\\nworks. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the\\none remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might\\nalmost have stood at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. On the highest point, the hindermost\\npoint, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside\\nan inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,\\nthe Etruscan wall has largely given way to the medi\\u00e6val fortress whose\\npresent aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only\\nto leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an\\noutpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of\\nthe whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seemingh\\nto stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the\\nhistory of Cortona in stone and brick.\\n\\nFrom the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and\\nthe other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,\\nthe glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chim\\u00e6ra is the glory\\nof the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought\\nwith endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a\\nfemale head, which we might at first take for the work of Renaissance \\nhands, and in which those who are skilled in such matters profess to\\nrecognize the existing type of Cortonese beauty. The painting however\\ndates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps\\nher ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their\\nskulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her\\npresent people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features\\nwere copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living\\ncountenance of one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerugia.\\n\\n\\nThe hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of medi\\u00e6val Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmedi\\u00e6val and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch's \\\"Life of Timole\\u00f4n,\\\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr\\u00e6historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.\\n\\nThe difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the\\nabiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical\\ndifference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if\\nwe will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of\\nPerugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona\\nsits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but\\non a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several -- possibly\\nseven -- outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.\\nThe Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of\\na very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and\\noutlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is\\nonly in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain\\nthe present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that\\nwe can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly\\na hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,\\nwhile the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.\\nBut Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the\\nplain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it\\nhas happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona\\nis not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long\\nperiod of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all\\nthe way from its railway station to its municipal palace.\\n\\nAt Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws\\nto itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\\n\\nPerugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as\\nreceptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked\\non. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At\\nthe two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on\\nthe Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.\\nAngelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long\\nseries of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to\\nLudlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with\\nits beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one\\nof the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other\\nend, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble\\nranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building\\nat its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the duomo \\nitself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it\\nshows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and\\nits pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not\\nchurches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from\\nother things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one\\nclass alone -- Augusta Perusia itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Volumnian Tomb.\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern\\nFreemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the\\nouter world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have\\nread various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,\\nits constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us\\nthe fullest particulars: we have only to complain that the historical\\npart is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should\\nnot like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient\\nin the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty\\nany further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact\\nduties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we\\nshould answer, not \\\"Amen,\\\" but \\\"So mote it be.\\\" Still, what Freemasonry\\nis, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a\\nFreemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books\\nleave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to\\nknow everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can\\nknow a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom\\nwe seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as\\nto the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,\\nand belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their\\nbuildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they\\nlived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan\\nbooks; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless\\ninscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language\\nwas, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,\\nhalf-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as\\nthe mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here\\nand there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one\\ningenious man has read it all into good German and another into good\\nTurkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like\\na Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything\\nin three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light\\non a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For\\nsurely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead\\nletter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,\\nbut at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.\\n\\nIt is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments\\nof a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part\\nof the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the\\ncollections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if\\nwe are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or\\nshall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly\\nEtruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes\\nlargely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this\\nmust specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have\\nleft no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly\\nfair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like\\nthe Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But\\nsuppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have\\nin the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek\\nor Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral\\nelement would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly\\ndominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be\\nso distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.\\nTake a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does\\nnot of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference\\nto the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven\\non the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in\\nthe Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye\\nand the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than\\neven the chim\\u00e6ra, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various\\nsizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.\\nThe departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the\\nuninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance\\nto divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is\\ndesigned to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the\\n Lucumonissa -- if we may coin so medi\\u00e6val a form -- lies apart, sometimes\\nalong with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to\\nbring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious\\nrace than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.\\n\\nBut if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\\n\\nWe are not describing at length what may be found described at length\\nelsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures\\nwhich gives them a strange and special interest. This is their\\nstrangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but\\nso are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch\\nof Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo\\nreclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly medi\\u00e6val recumbent\\nfigure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,\\nsay in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures\\non the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give\\nus living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the\\nRasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient\\nworks which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.\\nAnd nowhere do the sculptures look fresher -- almost modern -- than when\\nseen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the\\nsepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi.\\n\\n\\nThere is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of\\nmischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite\\ndifferent from that which makes the place famous with the world in\\ngeneral. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious\\nerror. When so many members of Parliament showed a few years back,\\nand when the Times showed only a very little time back, that they\\nbelieved that the University of Oxford was founded by somebody -- Alfred\\nwill do as well as anybody else -- and that the city of Oxford somehow\\ngrew up around the University, it became, and it remains, a duty to\\nhistoric truth to point out the importance of Oxford, geographical and\\ntherefore political and military, for some ages before the University\\nwas heard of. When the Times thought that Oxford was left to the\\nscholars, because \\\"thanes and barons\\\" did not think it worth struggling\\nfor, the Times clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford\\nthen, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because\\nOxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,\\nflourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat\\nof councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;\\nin other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,\\nwhile the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly\\nworthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects\\nwhich are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible\\nthat some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the\\nchurch and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the\\nerror is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the\\ncity of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis\\nand his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and\\nworld-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully\\nworthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on\\nages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place\\nwell worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and\\nthough his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light\\nmatter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very\\nunlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before\\nhim and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace\\nof the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called\\n\\\"seraphica civitas,\\\" before one of its later churches came to rank with\\nthe patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early\\nmedi\\u00e6val city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still\\nexist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a\\nkind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The\\nsaint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could\\nhe have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,\\nand doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow\\nstream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral\\nchurch of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the\\nGreat Twin Brethren.\\n\\nAssisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless\\nvarieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which\\nwe have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on\\nwhich it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge\\nmountain. As at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea, while the akropolis is high enough, there is\\nsomething far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis\\nof Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of\\nshelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The duomo \\nstands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top\\nof the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is\\nno small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the\\nremains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond\\nit, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling\\nof man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost\\nmore needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not\\nonly for the medi\\u00e6val walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark\\nan outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow\\nvalley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at\\ntheir feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the\\nglimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only\\nless wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb\\nfrom the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but\\nthere the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes\\nall the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,\\ngives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure\\nto the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a\\ncity running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of\\nbell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general\\neffect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,\\ncrowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except\\nthe steep of the mountain itself.\\n\\nOf particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a\\nrestriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,\\nSaint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest\\ninterest is the temple in the forum -- now Piazza grande -- with its\\nCorinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on\\nthe other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned\\ninto a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple\\nof Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting\\npart of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at\\nAssisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple\\nmust have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper\\nones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,\\nwith the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on\\nthe Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those\\ncomments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient\\nJewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the\\nsynagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is\\nthe dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,\\nand the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates\\nand people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great\\ncollection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it\\ndown quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the\\ndedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number\\nof inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,\\nthere are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best\\nworth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and\\noculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of\\nthe Sexviri for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,\\nand left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly\\nbrought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his\\ncoachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are\\nset thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of\\nforeign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and\\non the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements\\nwere practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of\\nAssisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less\\ngood a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.\\n\\nThe temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most\\nmemorable things in Pr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things\\nbesides, both Roman and medi\\u00e6val. The lower church of Sta. Maria\\nMaggiore , close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been\\nthe original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German\\nlook, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into\\nthe mind that it is the cella of a temple with arches cut through\\nits walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local\\nfashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter\\nhard by. Besides, at Sta. Maria Maggiore there are the clear remains\\nof a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,\\nunderneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has\\nbeen sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth\\ncentury, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,\\nand it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the\\ncrypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,\\nand Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above\\nare scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier\\nremains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the\\nsurrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman chester \\nabide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is\\nmodern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the Via San Paolo \\nleading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above\\nground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many\\nmemorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in\\nclimbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while\\nboth Saint Francis and Saint Clara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpello.\\n\\n\\nThe Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many\\ngates its full description as \\\"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia\\nCostante,\\\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum\\nor as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most\\nlikely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in\\none of its churches. Somebody must come to see them, or their keepers\\nwould not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them\\ncovered, in hopes of earning a lira by uncovering them. May we make\\nthe confession that we became aware -- or, to speak more delicately,\\nthat we were reminded -- of the existence of the colony at once Julian\\nand Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German\\nguide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel\\nthoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,\\nyet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and\\nthat, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman\\nmonuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more\\nperfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the\\nwonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we\\nshould hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;\\nbut a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is\\nno one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but\\nthere are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some\\nimportance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the\\nplace, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as\\nSpello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less\\nuntouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.\\nWe except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the medi\\u00e6val\\nhouses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.\\nBut that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong\\nin some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at\\nSpello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to\\nseize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the\\nfinest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains\\nand ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,\\nand the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers\\nand cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The medi\\u00e6val walls and towers,\\nat all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not\\neasily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the\\nantiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in\\nmere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps\\na little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not\\ndisappointing.\\n\\nAt Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;\\neven in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one\\nhand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no duomo , nor is\\nthere any other church of much architectural importance. The best are\\ntwo small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each\\nside of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building\\nof a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group\\nlying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There\\nis a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;\\nby its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the\\namphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with\\nits marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre\\nis down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the\\npresent city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original\\nRoman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever\\nthe influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed\\nwith so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from\\nSpello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments\\nwhich are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the\\nbuilding is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of\\nits bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;\\nother fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when\\nwe reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it\\nis its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.\\n\\nAs we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia\\nConstans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which\\nbears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the\\nconsular gate is reached only through a medi\\u00e6val one, which bears, as\\nwe have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the\\nstranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:\\nfor Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty\\nof climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in\\ncontinuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been\\npatched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single\\nsimple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to\\nthe lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,\\nknown as Porta Veneris , must have been a far more elaborate design.\\nBut the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double\\nentrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet\\nthere is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal\\ntowers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,\\nhigher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch\\nhanging in the air. This is locally known as the arco di trionfo . Of\\nthe arco di Augusto within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of\\nMacrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman\\nremains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and\\nfragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them\\nout. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival\\nVerona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain\\nperverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what\\nhas been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the\\nend of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match\\nthe mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one\\njourney. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to\\nspend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must\\nhurry on to aurea Roma herself, even though we have to rush by many a\\ntown and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest\\nof all, by\\n\\n ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,\\n The fortress of Nequinum lowers\\n O'er the pale waves of Nar.\\n\\nMarry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,\\npresents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to\\nhave come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the\\nRoman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Qu\\u00e6stor Bacchus -- it\\nis taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot\\nhelp Latinizing the Questore Bacco -- puts out another set of placards\\nto forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among\\nour memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a\\nsecession; we might almost expect to see once more\\n\\n ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.\\n\\nBut those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede\\neven to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the Sala\\nDante .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeii.\\n\\n\\nThe student of what M. Amp\\u00e8re calls \\\"L'Histoire Romaine \\u00e0 Rome\\\" must\\ntake care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history\\nof Rome -- and the local history of Rome is no small part of the\\n\\u0153cumenical history -- is not fully understood unless we fully take in\\nthe history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.\\nWith Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and\\nher allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made\\npart of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And\\nfirst on the list may well come the city which was before all others\\nthe rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of\\ndestruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through\\na country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with\\nthe heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has\\nutterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left\\nwithin the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we\\nare close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by\\na rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,\\nan inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the\\nfirst great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'\\nsiege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the\\nHellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such\\nas are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of\\nliving things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria\\nnothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some\\nconvulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,\\nand tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a\\nrace with whom death counted for more than life.\\n\\nA sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand\\nsome points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival\\nof Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,\\nwe understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the\\nhatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked\\non the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange\\na greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the\\ngreat border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate\\nneighbours which could contend with her on equal terms. Elsewhere, in\\nher early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace\\nor war with whole confederations.\\n\\nThe happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky\\ngroup of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great\\nas all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what\\nclearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And\\nwhen the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the\\ncharacter of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,\\nit is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city\\nwhich had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the\\nstage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing\\nRome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome\\nwould be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near\\ntogether could not go on together. Two cities, very great according\\nto the standard of those times, considerable according even to a\\nmodern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and\\neverything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the\\nmodern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours\\non its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and\\ndinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt\\nall the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while\\nRome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of\\nher dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,\\nconfederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come\\nsooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.\\n\\nThe site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city\\nmade, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing\\nlike the \\\"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\\\" Veii is\\nnot a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,\\nyet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above\\nthe steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the\\nfateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a\\ntable-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an\\nadmirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by\\nthe walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid\\nout on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as\\nin so many cases, the arx , a peninsula within a peninsula, was the\\noriginal city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,\\nit would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii\\ntook a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual\\ngrowth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted\\nextent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a\\ncity which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not\\nspread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the\\noccupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed\\nan old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber\\nbelow their walls.\\n\\nIt is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and\\nextent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which\\ncan be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in\\nthe circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring -- the Ponte\\nSodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.\\nBesides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs\\nof a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after\\ntimes arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains\\nof the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.\\nThere is the Roman columbarium , within the Etruscan site; there\\nare the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There\\nis, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures\\nand inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian\\nsepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment\\nto see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the\\nunaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the\\narms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive\\nform and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no\\nwritten \\u00e6nigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by\\nmarking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage\\nby far than the roof of Rome's Tullianum or its fellow at Tusculum.\\nIn the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it\\nbelongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from\\nEtruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes\\nfrom the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman\\nhistory, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think\\nit. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know\\nthat, except the palpable remains of the Roman municipium , nothing\\ncan be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.\\nIn the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by\\nconquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early\\nstage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same\\ndate, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;\\nthe only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and\\nhalf-Hellenic Macedonia.\\n\\nWe turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how\\nutterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman\\nhistory. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,\\ninasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.\\nBut that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in\\nRome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has\\nstretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be -- all this\\nwe understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of\\nLivy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiden\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nFrom the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the arx of\\nFiden\\u00e6 as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel\\nGiubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence\\nof Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other\\nthings sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to\\nhave been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems\\ndesigned as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter\\nof fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan\\noutpost on Latin soil. Whether Fiden\\u00e6 was really such an outpost in the\\nstrict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion\\nof the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was\\na Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the\\nEtruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally\\nof Veii, that Fiden\\u00e6 made itself memorable. If we accept the received\\nstory, the war which brought about the ruin of Fiden\\u00e6 was caused\\nbecause its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,\\nperhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus\\ntook so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,\\nand the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus\\nformed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We\\nmay believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least\\nwere real, if the witness of Augustus C\\u00e6sar is to be believed.\\n\\nEach of the roads which lead out of Rome -- since the railway came,\\nthere is practically only one way which leads into Rome -- has its own\\nspecial interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to\\nthe Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in\\nits material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations\\nis perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian\\ngate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing\\nto itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall\\nof Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by\\nthe Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in\\nthe new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline\\ngate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of\\nRome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of\\ndefence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome\\nmarched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to\\nput down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after\\nthe slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those\\nwho did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.\\nBefore the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the\\ndominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.\\nAnd when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the\\nnew entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that\\nher political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral\\ndominion was stronger than ever. \\\"At midnight the Salarian gate was\\nsilently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous\\nsound of the Gothic trumpet.\\\" And if these gates were a centre of\\nfighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of\\nburying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs\\nhere and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but\\nthis quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials\\nwhich is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline gate was the\\nliving tomb of unchaste vestals; not far beyond the Salarian we come\\nto the Christian c\\u0153meterium Priscillae . We go on; we descend the\\nhill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the\\nalluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting\\nof the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might\\nseem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived\\nand gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken\\ndown and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those\\nof Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but\\nif we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must\\nhave been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly\\nnew when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come\\nto another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a medi\\u00e6val\\ntower; the medi\\u00e6val tower now proclaims itself as an \\\"osteria\\\"; but\\nwe feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now\\nfairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills\\nbeyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills\\nof Fiden\\u00e6 are before us. To the right lies the ground between the\\nSalarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his\\nmaster Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the\\nrailway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with\\nTiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between\\nhills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a\\nrange of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to\\nthe right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fiden\\u00e6, in the pass which\\ndivides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on\\nthe inland side.\\n\\nThe arx of Fiden\\u00e6, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,\\na height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer\\nto them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river\\nleaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that\\nside rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city\\ncould look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of\\nthe small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,\\nthe Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii\\nitself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the arx \\nof Fiden\\u00e6 and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.\\nInland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when\\nFiden\\u00e6 was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place\\nagainst the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the\\nrest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original\\n arx . We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its\\n cloaca , the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley\\nby the brook between the lower hill of Fiden\\u00e6 and the hill which lies\\nbetween Fiden\\u00e6 and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It\\nwas no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground\\nas the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand\\nwhy Rome on the first opportunity swept Fiden\\u00e6 utterly away, while the\\nexistence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.\\n\\nAs at Veii, so at Fiden\\u00e6, the traces of the living are gone -- yet more\\nutterly at Fiden\\u00e6 than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more\\nplentiful, though Fiden\\u00e6 has nothing to set against the painted tomb of\\nVeii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won\\nthe spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fiden\\u00e6 as a deserted place,\\nthe possession of a single man. Yet the potestas of Fiden\\u00e6 -- perhaps\\nits dictator -- may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered\\non in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntemn\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nIt is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography\\nthat its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal\\ncharms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that\\nit has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.\\nThe merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages\\nback. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of\\nall ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are\\nof one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no\\nmonuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it\\nwill be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to\\nthis kind of research. At Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6 the great merit is that\\nthere is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the\\nmore to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fiden\\u00e6\\nuntouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;\\nbut we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.\\nAnd no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 full of Roman\\nand medi\\u00e6val monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,\\nas they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But\\nwe turn from Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 to a city compared with which Veii and\\nFiden\\u00e6 might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,\\nan exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fiden\\u00e6. The\\nsites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside\\nthe sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much\\nnearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it\\ndoes not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,\\neven more truly than at Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6, say that the very ruins\\nhave perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished\\nyet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special\\nattraction of its own.\\n\\nWe took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemn\\u00e6 both from the road to the\\nWhite Hens and from the road to Fiden\\u00e6. As we before said, it ought\\nto be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things\\nare not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh\\nfrom the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the\\nMilvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the\\noldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,\\nto let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that\\nof Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when\\nthe bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic\\nenemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood\\nthe host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius\\nor of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,\\nand how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time\\nwe keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We\\nare therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite\\nanother part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,\\nwho is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.\\nOur present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with\\nBelisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome\\nwas, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We\\nwalk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with\\nthe eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the\\nEtruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,\\nboth come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,\\nthat it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary\\nstream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct\\nand hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie\\nof origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the\\nmost frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor\\nwere sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a\\ndenizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was\\nlike handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path\\nkeeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at\\nall, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a\\nrocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside\\nthe Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters\\nwhen Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.\\nBut, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on\\na site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient\\nsettlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells\\nof any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in\\nthe hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy\\nhill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern\\nside by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemn\\u00e6, a vanished\\ncity whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive\\nwords. Antemn\\u00e6 was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose\\ndaughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers\\ncalled Quenfang , what sociologists called exogamy , which secured\\nthat the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;\\nRome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of\\nnobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemn\\u00e6 is merged, in Rome. We\\nmay be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which\\ngive Antemn\\u00e6 a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to\\nbe that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the\\nsite was, as now, like Fiden\\u00e6, the possession of a single man.\\n\\nThe story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus\\nspares at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.\\nParted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern\\npoint, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at\\nthe very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the\\ndescriptive name Antemnae , the town before the rivers. Such a site\\nbelongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the\\nPalatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was\\nwhile it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive\\nname, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree\\nof progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from\\nthe oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without\\nthe Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like\\nRome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which\\nmust cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be\\nincorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.\\n\\nOf a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that\\nwe can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the\\nsite. Antemn\\u00e6 has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some\\nstones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to\\nbe part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise\\ngreen hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.\\nBut the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates\\nare as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those\\nof Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fiden\\u00e6 and its surroundings, on\\nthe old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge\\nof Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the\\nGaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and\\nsome of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly\\nthe whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's\\n\\\"turriger\\u00e6 Antemn\\u00e6.\\\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the\\ntowers thereof than we were at Veii and Fiden\\u00e6. At Antemn\\u00e6 the ruins\\nthemselves have perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOstia.\\n\\n\\nFrom the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight\\nremains which mark the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6, from the almost more\\ninstructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemn\\u00e6, we may\\nwell pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any\\nof them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because\\nit was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This\\nis the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an\\nearly stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what\\nRome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making\\nRome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to\\npossess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once\\nmarked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland\\ntowns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and\\nnothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven\\nof Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes\\nOstia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.\\nAnd the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to\\nsupport it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as\\nproving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period\\nwhich is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,\\nperiod. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal\\nAncus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that\\nthe events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep\\nourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition\\nthen calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is\\nthat whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,\\nand that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.\\n\\nThis at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities\\nof that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime\\nenterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.\\nCorinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain\\ncitadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth\\nstarted in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.\\nIt marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies\\nabsolutely in the sea -- Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on\\nher peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland\\nAthens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on\\nthe broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand\\nthe value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or\\nVeii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet\\nmore. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or\\neven Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful\\nfor her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There\\nwere inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no\\ninland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.\\nIndeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime\\nor otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had\\nno separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a\\ndistance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.\\n\\nOstia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is\\neminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of\\nthose fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He\\nhas changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a\\nlittle dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which\\nhave been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,\\nand they have brought to light much that is most interesting and\\ninstructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in\\nvain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon\\nas they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its\\npavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,\\nleads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end\\nis gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to\\nthe stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to\\nimitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his\\nsuccessor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside\\nthe mouth of the cloaca maxima ; make a strong wall of defence against\\nthe waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long\\nas the cloaca maxima itself.\\n\\nAnd what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small\\npart of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia\\nis becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a\\nsomewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first\\nwith the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment\\never happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery\\nof Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at\\nwidely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing\\nwhich is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there\\nor anywhere else -- namely, destruction by the Saracens in the fifth \\ncentury, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \\\"Handbook,\\\" but which was\\ncertainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored\\nby Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as\\nthe haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards\\novercame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for\\nit. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change\\nwhich it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour\\nof Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to\\nlive on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings\\nlater than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with\\ngraceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is\\nabundant evidence that all through the second century of our \\u00e6ra great\\narchitectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there\\nis the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so\\nproudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions\\nsupply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be\\ntoo much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which\\ncertainly suggests that of Arles.\\n\\nIn the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he\\ncomplains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course\\nof the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is\\neminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,\\nsome rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber\\nmakes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,\\nif Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of\\nwalls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,\\namong the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides\\nof a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,\\nbelonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were\\nclearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall\\nwas broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;\\nthey chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best\\nsuited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may\\nwell have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The\\nwall of Servius had ceased to serve any military purpose, and the wall\\nof Aurelian was not yet.\\n\\nThe history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain\\nattempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into Gregoriopolis ,\\nbelongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its\\ncastle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but\\nwith seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old\\nOstia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart custode , who defends\\nhimself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle\\nof Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the\\ncathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which\\nnothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;\\nthe staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among\\ncardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the\\nolder site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated\\nstate. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a\\nstreet dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses\\nitself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,\\nleaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.\\nAt Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is\\ndug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the\\nfar greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are\\ncontent; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and\\nMother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with\\nFather Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our\\nguide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,\\nset forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly\\nminded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alban Mount.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places\\nwhich bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie\\nso far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different\\nnations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of\\nconnexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has\\nsettled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must\\nnot forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell\\nin the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or\\nAlbany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic\\nwas lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,\\nshe spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that\\nshe might have answered with a tu quoque or something more; the\\nEnglishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.\\nBut have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with\\nthe Duke of Al v a -- for in his tongue \\\"non aliud est v i v ere quam\\n b i b ere\\\" -- or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is\\nsingular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of\\nRome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as\\nthose by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and\\nthose Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.\\nIt is \\u1fec\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1\\u1fd6\\u03bf\\u03b9 and \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af in both cases, without the change of jot or\\ntittle. In this case, at least, we believe that philologers would deny\\nthe slightest kindred between the names; but the casual identity is\\nthereby only made the more startling. A malicious critic might say\\nthat Anna's Romans were as unlike old Romans as her Albanians could be\\nunlike the men of Alba Longa. But her Romans did at least claim to be\\nRomans, sharers in the inheritance of the wolf and the eagle; while\\nher Albanians certainly laid no claims to any rights in the Alban sow\\nand her thirty pigs.\\n\\nRome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly\\nthat its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in\\nderivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount\\nkept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There\\nis the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely\\ninterwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road\\nby which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still\\nthe displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre\\nof the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the\\npillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of\\ncrowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes\\nhis eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she\\ndid in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as\\nfavourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood\\nof living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,\\naccording to one version of his story, his body -- or perhaps only his\\nhead -- found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the\\nAlexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had\\nso many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all Albana ,\\nthe Albanum of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long\\nterraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The\\nwalled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Pr\\u00e6torian\\ncamp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still\\nexists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still\\nkeeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,\\nseek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano\\nand Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.\\nIn both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in\\nthe neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between\\nthem, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample\\nruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato\\nstood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in\\nher day of overthrow.\\n\\nThe town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most\\nprominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from\\nRome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn\\nstone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cn\\u00e6us Pompeius\\nMagnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its\\neffect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers\\nbetween the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.\\nWhich of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more\\nimpossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the\\noutline of the Glastonbury kitchen -- before its chimneys perished -- and\\nthereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of\\nthe camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several\\nother fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.\\nBut after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a\\nstarting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less\\nas a starting-point for\\n\\n ... the still glassy lake that sleeps\\n Beneath Aricia's trees.\\n\\nAricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to\\nthe level of the arx , to be approached by Albano by almost the only\\nwork on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct\\nof that \\\"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\\\" -- his votaries seem never quite to\\ndistinguish between him and Jupiter -- is really a work worthy of C\\u00e6sars\\nor consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments\\nof walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,\\nthe crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest\\nsurely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps\\nof prim\\u00e6val wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare\\nus for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;\\nwalls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,\\nand to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \\\"still glassy\\nlake\\\" to which the grove of the \\\"rex nemorensis\\\" has given the name of\\nNemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled\\nyears and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nIn these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for\\nventuring on an allusion which it might need a little research to take\\nin. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with\\nourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the\\nexplanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process\\nis a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to\\nspeak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat\\ngrotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better\\nknown as Caligula.\\n\\nThe ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,\\nand the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by\\nthe present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and\\nwho, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi\\nfrom close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among\\nthings, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow\\nof Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of\\nits height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so\\nwe go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we\\nfind the emissarius , so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done\\nits work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some\\none long before Camillus? The men who built the great cloaca of\\nRome were quite capable of cutting the hole through the rock of Alba,\\nwithout any message from Delphi or any design against the walls of\\nVeii. Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than\\nClaudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it\\nhas been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,\\nwe may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only\\nto keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp\\ntill we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy\\nof the name crater . We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side\\nby side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some\\ntime which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to\\nsay that it was long before the oldest prim\\u00e6val wall, the powers of\\nwater supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with\\nits narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable\\nto be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily\\ncome to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,\\ntaken to check it.\\n\\nBut when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house\\nwhich the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by\\nthe rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called\\nfields of Hannibal -- yet another crater, science tells us -- when we have\\nclimbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed\\nunderstand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than\\nwe did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over\\nthe battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Pr\\u00e6neste; it\\nmay range hither and thither over many points which have their charm\\nboth of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the\\nhistorical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will\\nbetter take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven\\nhills shrunk out of sight, a point -- rather a line -- in the Latin plain,\\nwith a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different\\nwas the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see\\nhow she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we\\nsee how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;\\nand we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look\\ndown too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the\\nvanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great\\nflat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.\\nHere, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where\\n\\n ... the Witch's Fortress\\n O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.\\n\\nAnd beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more\\ndistant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as\\na height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name\\nof Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,\\nnot only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights\\naround it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we\\nfeel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of\\nwide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a\\npower seated at Veii or at Pr\\u00e6neste. Rome, on her great river, with\\nher haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or\\nallies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the\\ngreat powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread\\nEtruscan pirates and Ph\\u0153nician traders; the Greek of Cum\\u00e6 might\\nperhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.\\nWe may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the\\nfall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that\\nare left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was\\nthat Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the\\ncamping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we\\nbelieve in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how\\nthings had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the\\nCarthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into\\nItaly by land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCori.\\n\\n\\nThere was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the\\nAcademy a little time back, that there must be something \\\"irritating to\\nthe Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often\\nadopted by English writers towards Italian history.\\\" \\\"Their cities,\\\"\\nhe said, \\\"which are still instinct with political and social life, are\\nregarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque\\nreminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\\\" Mr. Creighton was\\nspeaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he\\nsays may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where\\nthe political and social life at least hides itself from the passing\\ntourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as\\nnothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the\\ncity seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;\\nit is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after soldi \\nwhich nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid\\nof; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying\\nwhich the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree\\nmore advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less\\nfar back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once\\nindependent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,\\nand, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they\\nwere, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are\\nnow, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than\\ntheir successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty\\nof the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants -- far\\nkeener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the\\ncity awakens in his mind -- really does him no harm. The modern Latins\\nor Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of\\nthe country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the\\ncuriosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the\\nPrisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave\\nand discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when\\nhe knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is\\nsomething grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the\\nsight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the\\ncentre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;\\nnot exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not\\nill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.\\n\\nSomething of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at\\nleast, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right\\nwing of the Latin host of Regillus:\\n\\n Aricia, Cora, Norba,\\n Velitr\\u00e6, with the might\\n Of Setia and of Tusculum.\\n\\nTusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate\\npilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban\\nmount; \\\"Setia's purple vineyards\\\" it may be hard to take into the line\\nof march; but, with a slight change of order, \\\"Velitr\\u00e6, Cora, Norba,\\\"\\nwith the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,\\nwill form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have\\nmade it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that\\nthey have not cut into two. Velitr\\u00e6 -- hardly changed in the modern\\nVelletri -- has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest\\nbell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps\\nin, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps\\nout the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;\\nit stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter\\nneighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the\\necclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral\\nchurch placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom\\nof the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern\\npalaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman\\nremains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of medi\\u00e6val times. The\\nchief value of the town is as a starting-point -- we can hardly call it\\ncentre -- for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The\\nview from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,\\ndying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the\\nmighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all\\nthe height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its\\nfollowing of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like\\na great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean\\nDown and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes\\ntowards them by something more than their bright masses, something more\\nthan a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points\\nare crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned\\nstands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far\\nlower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some\\nway down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when\\nthe sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for\\nwhich Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for -- \\n\\n ... the gigantic watch-towers,\\n No work of earthly men,\\n Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook\\n The never-ending fen.\\n\\nWatch-towers, perhaps, in the strictest sense, we do not see, and we\\nshall hardly find them when we come nearer; but Cora, Cori , still\\nkeeps the mightiest of walls, which it was no wonder that men looked\\non as too mighty to be the work of such mortals -- in Homer's phrase -- as\\nwe now are, and looked on them as reared by no hands weaker than those\\nof the forgers of Jove's own thunderbolts. With Cori we enter on the\\nexamination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their\\nprim\\u00e6val walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the\\nwalls that are the most prim\\u00e6val of all. None of its fellows can show\\nsuch blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call\\nCyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside\\nwhat is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see\\nelsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together\\nas they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;\\nhuge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between\\nthem filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole\\nrange of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious\\nin such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,\\nRoman of Sulla's day, and -- the leap is a great one -- medi\\u00e6val walls\\nof the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin\\nking of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him\\nas sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first\\nfour -- we have already spoken of the first of all -- are all polygonal,\\nof distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.\\nThe rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the\\nbottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the\\n arx which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament\\nof Cori in quite another department.\\n\\nAccording to the nearly invariable rule, the arx of Cora contained\\na temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into\\na church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in\\nmany other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without\\ndamaging the portico of the house of Hercules -- the old Latin Herculus\\nwas hopelessly confused with the H\\u00earakl\\u00eas of Greek legend -- and still\\nkeeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;\\nkeeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his cella , the\\ninscription which records the work of the local duumvirs , Manlius\\nand Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They\\nprofess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they\\nstand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the\\nCapitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive\\nas P\\u00e6stum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,\\nthe upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,\\nand it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against\\nrule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns -- such as are\\nleft -- of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;\\nbut we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the\\npeculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not\\nspeak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise\\nagain after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?\\nStern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and\\nfavourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to\\nsome such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points\\nof view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.\\n\\nBut we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of\\nthis strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning\\nat a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss\\nof Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we\\nare tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few\\nfragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We\\nlight too on inscriptions. Besides the duumvirs -- one might call them\\nthe bailiffs -- of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the\\nfrieze of Hercules, another commemorates two Praitors ; surely these,\\nwith their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin\\nCommonwealth -- as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium -- dependent on\\nRome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the\\nchief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to\\nChristian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,\\nan altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's\\nhead, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.\\nOliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it\\nis a lovely cloister of that better kind of Renaissance which was in\\ntruth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials\\nof earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them\\nwith capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be\\nfound in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a\\nplace for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba\\ncannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the\\ntraveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him\\ntake his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than\\nsleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up\\nearly in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him\\nrather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorba.\\n\\n\\nWe will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers\\nhaving been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on\\ntheir way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,\\nskirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views\\nof the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea\\nbeyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when\\nthe traveller has found a firm foothold within \\\"Norba's ancient wall\\\"\\nthan while he has personal experience how\\n\\n The patient ass, up flinty paths,\\n Plods with his weary load.\\n\\nStill worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded\\ndown, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy\\nto persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness\\nof the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to\\nbe unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;\\nthe hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on\\nhis own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the\\nwall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the\\nass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed\\nwhen we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find\\nhow far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs\\nspring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will\\nbe almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in\\nkind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he\\ncannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.\\nFor within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for\\nthe crops are there, full and green -- \\\" segetes, ubi Norba fuit \\\" -- but\\nthe ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.\\nWe would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now\\ndoes ever since the people of Norba -- less wise, as the event showed,\\nthan their neighbours of Cora -- embraced the cause of Marius with such\\ndesperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather\\nthan let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.\\nThis inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in\\nat least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate\\ndictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great\\nsingle blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma\\nby its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has\\nperished only less utterly than Norba itself.\\n\\nCori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has\\nany fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.\\nCori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread\\ndown the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the\\nmountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a\\nsteep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves\\ndownwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.\\nBut we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so\\ncarefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various\\npoints on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers\\ndeemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the arx \\nrose on several terraces; its highest point -- crowned, we may believe,\\nas usual, by a temple -- must have formed a proud object indeed from the\\nvast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its\\nancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine\\nflat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori\\nrather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits\\non the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower\\nelevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples\\nof the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as\\nit is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,\\nwhich does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.\\nIt is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken\\nthe place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we see that Norma and Norba\\nby no means join one another; there is a gap between them which, while\\nwe are on the mountain, might pass for a valley. But as we look from\\nbelow, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,\\nand Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like\\na continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,\\nperhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within\\nwhich the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can\\ntake in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of\\nSermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the\\nwhole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points\\nwith which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from\\nthe height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and\\nnew proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable\\nmembers of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front\\nof the Circ\\u00e6an height -- a height so nearly cut off from the mainland\\nthat it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we\\nbetter understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days\\nwhen they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked\\nin what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of\\nmolehills by the yellow Tiber.\\n\\nAs the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by\\nthe walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill\\nstands distinct, the arx alone crowns the top, and where the town\\nwalls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts\\nitself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass\\nof the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the\\nrudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they\\nhave a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,\\nand it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone\\nhas been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of\\nthe weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the\\nfiner stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth\\ntheir while, do something more than this. They could, when they had\\nto make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of\\nexactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded\\noff, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at\\nthe greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign\\nof either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it\\nwould almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the\\nopening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung\\nbetween two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the\\nfirst builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which\\nmen began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great\\ninvention, is shown by a ruined building -- one of the few things within\\nthe wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building -- a little\\nway beyond the arx . Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for\\nthe roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea and New Grange,\\nnor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and\\nthe attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well\\nas from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,\\nmost unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call\\nthem, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange\\nproblem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have\\nalready hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,\\nlike that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as\\nwell come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.\\n\\nFrom prim\\u00e6val and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning\\nas we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only\\nmedi\\u00e6val, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is\\na house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least\\njust outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual\\ndwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have\\nonce been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which\\nstrikes us between the stern prim\\u00e6val wall of Norba, fencing in the\\nthick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied\\nand picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and\\nbuildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till\\na thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,\\nroofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of\\nruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of\\na dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played\\nits part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested\\nby its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to\\ndo with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed\\nelection. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,\\nled to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to\\nbe reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak\\nmight restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder\\nmen living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa\\nwithout greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is\\nsomething specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,\\nstanding so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look\\nof things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of\\nthe ruined medi\\u00e6val sites which often meet us in this region. It is\\nnot merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something\\nIrish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both\\nat Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in\\nIreland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,\\nthere is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might\\nhave been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of\\nthe houses reaching even into Renaissance times. The church of most\\npretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses\\nand the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness\\nof ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a\\ntown, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa\\nhas little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As\\nfor the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on\\nthe hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an\\nunrecorded age piled together to make Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegni.\\n\\n\\nThe visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history\\non the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite\\ncertain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take\\nwith him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there\\nmay be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a\\nhidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that\\nclass, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes\\nnothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they\\ndo not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A\\nnatural and important question is sure to present itself, and -- without\\nwings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome -- there is no immediate\\nmeans of answering it. Is the name of Signia -- now by a very slight\\nchange Segni -- to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of\\nLatium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry\\nthem all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in\\nwhich Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every\\nstep that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully\\nadmire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out\\nin each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his\\nquotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still\\nMacaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,\\nif he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian\\nand Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the\\nfact that \\\"Ferentinum of the rock,\\\" yet further on, has its place in\\nthem alongside of \\\"Gabia of the pool.\\\" He turns to his guide-book -- and\\nthe guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,\\nis almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only\\nthe entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with\\nthe remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.\\nAnd again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in\\nthe later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part -- Were the\\npeople of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic\\npavements? There is a kind of work called opus Signinum , a pattern\\nof black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at\\nPompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an\\nexample a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting\\nas the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin\\nLeague. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which\\nit will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had\\nat Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself\\na little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the\\nplace where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to\\nthe great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he\\nmay for the moment comfort himself by thinking that there are those who\\nmight be unkind enough to hint that he would still be equally uncertain\\nif he had a hundred quotations on the tip of his tongue, or if he were\\nin a library with thousands of volumes to turn to.\\n\\nBut whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not -- we may be\\nallowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \\\"a\\nSix-preacher\\\" -- there is no doubt as to its geographical position;\\nthere is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from\\nVelletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of \\u00c6quian\\nencampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the\\nVolscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between\\nthem and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark\\nmore than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by\\nus, in the low ground -- reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale -- the\\nwalls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful\\nheight and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves\\nhidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,\\nas we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its\\nmountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller\\ndetached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.\\n\\nSegni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the\\nsame class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but\\na table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on\\nthe mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it\\nwith Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the\\nimmediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the\\nsame as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano\\nhas more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of\\nbeing an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long\\nand narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the\\nspace within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The\\nspace within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded\\nwith dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one\\nquarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other\\ncases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the arx of\\nSignia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,\\nbut placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between\\nthe two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of\\nthe modern Signians; but under the name of Passegiata it does form\\npart of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the\\nother loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the\\ntraveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of\\nthe road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway\\nof Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the\\ngreat number of graceful fragments of medi\\u00e6val work to be found within\\nthe narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages\\ntoo poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing\\nbeauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from\\nentering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit\\nof the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the\\nright hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case\\noverwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen\\nfar away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the\\ngateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as\\nit were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing\\nwhich the prim\\u00e6val city has to show him.\\n\\nBut before he can reach either the Roman or the prim\\u00e6val gate he will\\nhave begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is\\nhardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great\\ndeal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.\\nThe huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note\\nperhaps two stages, yet often intermingled -- one, where the sides only \\nof the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where\\nthe outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \\\"rustication\\\" in\\nlate Renaissance work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a\\nstate of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the\\nshape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In\\na later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand\\nfree from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy\\nto say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how\\nmuch to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it\\nsomewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,\\nand a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.\\nBut it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of\\nthe hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the\\nwhole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required\\nit, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some\\ndistance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally\\nknown as Porta Saracenesca , leads from the outside world into the\\nouter enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close\\nto the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most\\nlikely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds\\nno small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of\\nthose instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of\\nthe principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search\\nof it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out\\nof stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they\\nwere striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting\\non two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as\\nthose of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle\\nof the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was\\nto place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately\\nunder the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of\\nthe lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain\\nvain striving after something different. As such, it is no small\\nlesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled\\ntogether to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us\\nback from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when\\nthe arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days\\nwhen men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of\\nconstructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are\\nmere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look\\nthan those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the\\nlintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever\\ntheir relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to\\ninnovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last\\ncrowned with success.\\n\\nIt is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can\\nunderstand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,\\nwhich has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called\\n arco Gotico ; it is harder to guess why the great prim\\u00e6val gate of\\nSegni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only\\nprim\\u00e6val gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been\\ncounted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of\\nthe enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall\\ncoincide. Hard by Porta Saracenesca itself is a small sally-port;\\nof the others, the larger ones, like Porta Saracenesca itself,\\nstand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same\\nstrivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the\\nground forbids the arx from reaching any great height above the rest\\nof the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular\\nlarge cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions\\nof different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.\\nHere is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive\\nconstruction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the cella in\\nRoman masonry, and the Roman wall of the cella is now carried up to\\nform a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,\\nbut it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes\\nwhich the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.\\n\\nLanded, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of\\nthe greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its\\nsatellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide\\navailable at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case\\nwe see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third\\nand greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of\\nSegni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the\\nCatholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.\\nPeter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.\\n\\nWe are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over\\nthe valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with\\ndouble force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,\\nbut still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and\\nhis lion-like reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIter ad Brundisium.\\n\\nI. Anagni.\\n\\n\\nHe who goes steadily from Rome to Brindisi, seeing what comes in his\\nway by the easiest manner of going, will not come very much oftener\\non the track of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is\\nthe haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he\\ncan along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will\\nof necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from\\nRome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.\\nBut the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and\\nits lesser fellow -- the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and\\ndry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child\\nAlbano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the\\ntemple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left -- all\\nthese seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So\\nmay the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre, -- the\\nhill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \\\"Norba's ancient wall,\\\" with\\nneither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it -- Ninfa's more modern\\nwall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,\\nruined churches, in abundance -- all these may be connected with an\\n iter ad Brundisium , but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let\\nour traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway -- we were\\ngoing to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could\\nwell be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his\\ntime-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni\\nand go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.\\nNot that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the\\ngates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It\\nwould most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,\\nprince of guidebook-makers, recommends the locanda there as \\\"reinlich\\nund eidlich,\\\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller\\nwill be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more\\ninclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is\\nno doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,\\nAnagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is\\nthe first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is\\nnot unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make\\nAnagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest\\nfor the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome\\nbut from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points\\nin some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he\\nwill be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,\\nalmost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is\\nas the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met\\nhis end, the prisoner -- not the last Pope who was fated so to be -- of\\na French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the\\nmind. In medi\\u00e6val history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to\\nthis day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress\\nmeaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.\\nAnagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore\\ndid not suffer at the hands of Renaissance Popes as Rome lived to\\nsuffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well\\ngo back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,\\nthen Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome\\nwhich neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and\\nPyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in\\nwhich Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation\\nof the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is\\nharder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading\\nOld-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few\\npersonal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or\\nOld-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical\\nor legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,\\nand the one great event in their political history; and those tell us\\na great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom\\nSpurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great\\nTriple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having\\nneither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,\\nthey hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.\\nBut their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust\\nin as they were between \\u00c6quians and Volscians, no alliance could\\nbe more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most\\nexposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself\\nwas the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle\\nmust have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must\\nhave looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants\\nof the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have\\nendured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening\\nneighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to\\nanother, we better understand the political relations of the endless\\nlittle communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The\\nally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need\\nto climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack\\nor deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them\\ntherefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare\\nand without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but\\nthey were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's\\nsight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at\\nAnagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either\\nat Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If\\nin some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less\\nclearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as\\nits symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one\\nanother could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.\\nThey must be always doing something to one another in the way either\\nof friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when\\nSpurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the\\nfirst Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land\\nand its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed\\nput a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.\\n\\nWe come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded\\nin by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni\\nand Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an\\nisolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,\\nthe city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the\\nhill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the\\nmiddle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief\\nstreet between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the\\nhill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,\\nthan can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,\\nallowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,\\nand a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must\\nconfess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well\\ntheir bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works\\nof the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the\\ndifference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious\\nforms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring\\nus back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by\\nordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord\\nMacaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there\\nwould have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \\\"no work of\\nearthly men,\\\" or as -- \\n\\n Reared by the hands of giants\\n For godlike kings of old.\\n\\nThe walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome\\nare wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to\\nput together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it\\nwas to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who\\nthoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use\\nit with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,\\nround the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they\\nare broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others\\nmerely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone\\nthrough all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the\\ncourse of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a\\nwhole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a\\ngood deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to\\ntheir nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.\\nIn some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by\\nfurther defences, buttresses rather than towers -- defences, by-the-way,\\nwhich must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later\\ntimes. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,\\ngreater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and\\nalways laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of\\nlarger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones\\nof two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a\\nlight-coloured stone exactly like the puff-stone of Gloucestershire,\\nthe material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings\\nin that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark\\nvolcanic peperino , which, towards the south-eastern part of the wall,\\nis used much more freely. The general effect, wherever the wall is at\\nall perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and\\ncolour.\\n\\nNow was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a\\ncertain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back\\nto our library; we take down the Dictionary of Geography ; we turn to\\nthe article \\\"Anagnia,\\\" and we find that by far the best contributor to\\nthe series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings\\nare damped when he says, \\\"The only remains extant there are of Roman\\ndate and of little interest.\\\" As to the \\\"little interest,\\\" we venture\\nto have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great\\nan extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an\\nobject of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the\\nlatest days which could come under the definition of \\\"Roman date.\\\"\\nBut what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of\\nthe Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us\\nto believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic\\nEmperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call\\nthe Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For\\nMarcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \\\" Flamen sume\\nsamentum .\\\" He did not know what \\\" samentum \\\" meant, and we cannot find\\nthe word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its\\nmeaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which\\nthe flamen put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want\\nto be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans\\nat some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they\\nhad no fellowship with the prim\\u00e6val works at Cori and at Segni; they\\ndid seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at\\nRome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the\\nwalls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from\\na Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were\\nburthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may\\ncarry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read\\nbetween four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,\\nwe shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the\\ndays of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have\\nlooked.\\n\\nOne thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the\\nbuilders of the cloaca at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders\\nof Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On\\nthe highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out\\ntowards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient arx , we may\\nstill see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised\\nby the arrangements of the medi\\u00e6val castle, the double gate of the\\nancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well\\nturned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same\\nworkmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the\\nbeginning. The arx itself, it should be remembered, had its separate\\nwall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the\\nsame character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street\\na little lower down.\\n\\nWhen we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character\\nin which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican\\nwalls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is\\nso far more famous as the city of medi\\u00e6val Popes that it is fitting\\nthat it should have something to show in that character also. The\\ntown is rich in medi\\u00e6val fragments. The main street, in its winding\\ncourses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,\\nwhich, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,\\nno small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with\\narches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one\\npapal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent\\nBishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for\\ntheir span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal\\npalace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,\\non its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France\\nor England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases\\noften present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the\\nmain street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches\\nresting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And\\nan elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender\\nshaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless\\nto add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these\\nrelics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured\\nand mutilated.\\n\\nIn the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good\\nfragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but\\nthe cathedral church within the arx is the only one which has the\\nleast claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on\\nthe edge of the hill with its east end -- that is, what would be east\\naccording to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west -- rising\\nup nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a\\nstately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on\\ntwo sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is\\nin a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the\\nchurch is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of\\nthe Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,\\nless satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains\\nthe vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many\\nother curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;\\nlet us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at\\nleast, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern\\nof the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the\\nmother-church of Rome and of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Ferentino.\\n\\n\\nItaly contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,\\nas England contains two places -- perhaps more -- bearing the several\\nnames of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,\\nRochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester\\nis also very conveniently written Rutchester , so the Etruscan\\nFerentinum is also conveniently written Ferentia . On an iter ad\\nBrundisium we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan\\nFerentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to\\nthe Itineraries, was to be found on the Via Latina between Anagnia\\nand Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name\\nof the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,\\nits ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is\\nHernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet\\nit is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the\\nendless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other\\ncompany that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest\\nremembrance of the name places \\\"Ferentinum of the rock\\\" among the\\nThirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot\\nwith the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the\\nrule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where -- \\n\\n ... in the centre thickest\\n Were ranged the shields of foes,\\n And from the centre loudest\\n The cry of battle rose.\\n\\nYet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to\\nfind a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican\\nhills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant\\ncomrades as Tibur and Pedum and \\\"Gabii of the pool.\\\" And, when we\\ncome back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more\\nand more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in\\nthat list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess -- among a\\nhundred other guesses -- at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next\\nbefore Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near\\nto our mark as Fortinei ; so we may hope for the best; but remembering\\nwhere Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes\\nare small.\\n\\nIn obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way\\nto Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take\\nin the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.\\nTill we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that\\nAnagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and\\nthe rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill\\nof Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that\\nthe spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \\\"Ferentinum\\nof the rock.\\\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many\\nother hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we\\nbegin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord\\nMacaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has\\nat least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the\\nrock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,\\nand sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.\\nAnd the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of\\nour series. They are still standing through the greater part of their\\nancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,\\ndiffering in material and construction. There is an original lower\\npart of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as\\nrude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which\\nthis earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,\\nbut it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later\\nrepairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction\\nof very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were\\nnot for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work\\nhas a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction\\nand material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work\\nby the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the\\narch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.\\nThe only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with\\nmerely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from\\nthe modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones\\nof the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient\\nentrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they\\nwere, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take\\na military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.\\nAnother gate, now known as Porta Maggiore , is a much more elaborate\\nwork, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is\\nplaced with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall\\nturns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great\\nadvantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows\\nwhether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult\\njust at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes\\nleast interesting. When we have to scramble -- all at least save Alpine\\nclimbers -- with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,\\nwe are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of\\nconstruction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to\\nrefer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no\\nsuch necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,\\nand the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed\\nat the same time. And at one point, not far from the Porta Maggiore ,\\nit will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long\\ninscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,\\nAulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part\\nat Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later\\nat Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of\\nhis day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty\\nbushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the\\nboys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the\\nwill of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity\\nCommissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get\\ntheir nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance -- yet\\nmany well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf -- will they\\ndevise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the\\nbenefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions\\nnearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the Times \\nwas filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in\\nSomerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once\\nstanding in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In\\none point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more\\nlucky. When Ferentinum had quatuorviri , they did not bury people in\\ntheir temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to\\npeople who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates\\nthe bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to\\nbe seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,\\nas a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his\\nbenefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated\\nby Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we\\ntrust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,\\nPopes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull\\ndown buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and\\nvillas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which\\nshould go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.\\n\\nWe have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we\\nwish -- we must confess the weakness -- to see independent Hernicans\\nwherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come\\nback and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum\\nspoken of, without any special emotion, as \\\"Roman.\\\" We look up\\nagain in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word\\ncertainly means something quite different from what it commonly\\nmeans in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light\\non anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us\\nto accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far\\nback as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think\\nthat the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old\\nCorinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great\\npiece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more\\nimportant -- though about the comparative importance some might raise a\\ndoubt -- than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them\\nby the proper road; we must get into what once was the arx , what\\nis now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,\\necclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly\\nthrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or\\nhouses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that\\nFerentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,\\nand several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed\\nat Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept\\nasunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the\\nsmall and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The\\nmost striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the\\nmass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the\\nbell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the arx , as a\\nmighty sub-structure. The walls of the arx show the same two dates\\nas the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude\\nstones of the first period; at another part they support the upper\\nrange of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to\\nHernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the\\n\\\"Roman\\\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of\\nthe censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius -- censors, that is, not\\nof Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first\\nvolume of the great Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , p. 238, and\\nits closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the Priscae\\nLatinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica . Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus\\nLollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known\\npersons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one\\nasks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got\\nhold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They\\nhad no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they\\nare written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the\\nRoman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have\\nbuilt what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside\\nonly mean that they built the later work on the top of the prim\\u00e6val\\nwall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an\\narchaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in\\nthe Tabularium of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row\\nof triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \\\"Cornelius Lucius Scipio\\nGnaivod patre prognatus.\\\" But we need not go back quite so far as his\\nday. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla\\nwill do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans\\nof Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.\\nFerentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns\\nwhich were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows\\nis most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,\\nrefused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather\\nto remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,\\nthe old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of\\nthe Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and\\nmagistrates -- Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them -- subject\\nonly to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars\\nof Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful\\nRomans.\\n\\nThis last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.\\n3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth\\nthe wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman pr\\u00e6tor suddenly\\nwished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for\\nherself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so\\nher husband bade the two qu\\u00e6stors of the town to be seized; one was\\nscourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the\\nwords of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which\\nRoman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities\\neven of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.\\n\\nIt is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the town as\\na municipium , while Livy also casually implies its possession of the\\nLatin franchise. Such obiter dicta do not go for very much. Scholars\\nsometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only\\ncasual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus\\nnot long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to\\naccuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the\\nWest of England. We here read of \\\"the county of the city of Bristol,\\\"\\nthe \\\"borough of Gloucester,\\\" the \\\"borough of Bath,\\\" and the \\\"borough of\\nTaunton.\\\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting\\nthat Bath is a \\\"city\\\" and Gloucester even a \\\"county of a city.\\\" May\\nwe not sometimes get wrong about municipia and Latin colonies from\\nthe same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a\\n municipium , but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,\\nwe once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the\\nelectors of a county to elect, not a \\\"knight of the shire,\\\" as they\\nhad done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called\\na \\\"member of Parliament.\\\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and\\neven Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,\\n curiae , and centuries, in ages long before their own day?\\n\\nThe walls then, though called \\\"Roman\\\" in a vague sense -- that is, it\\nwould seem, simply not prim\\u00e6val, like those of Cori and Segni -- are\\ndoubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was\\nstill a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most\\nlikely the walls over which the unlucky qu\\u00e6stor threw himself. The\\nwalls of the arx , where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,\\nconnect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the\\ninscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and\\nfrom the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral -- a\\nvery good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.\\nThe church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal\\ndamaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its\\nbell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A\\nlittle restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make\\nit into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,\\nunless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,\\nantiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little\\nminster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except\\nby comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if\\nthe church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime\\nof the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what\\nwe heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the\\ncrime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually\\nbegun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as\\nyet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse\\nto drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.\\n\\nThe church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen\\nthere in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant\\nvoice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the\\n arx -- buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account -- strange\\ntales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place\\neither in history or in received legend. Among other things he was\\nthrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a\\nvery pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one\\ndesigns to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,\\nit strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or\\nas we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other\\necclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city\\nof the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these\\nplaces; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which\\nhas an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people\\nwho chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome\\nlose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy\\nplaces of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and\\nanother creed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. Alatri.\\n\\n\\nThe tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with prim\\u00e6val walls, among\\nwhich we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at\\nAlatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly\\nclaim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest\\nplace, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is\\nthe one which has the least history. There is very little to say about\\nit, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but\\npreferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the\\nproffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained\\na distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least\\nthere can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich\\nin medi\\u00e6val antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich\\nin Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or\\nless Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri\\nnearly everything that we care about is strictly prim\\u00e6val. We cannot\\nreasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look\\nwere there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new\\nthen.\\n\\nAlatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in\\nall ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no\\nplace in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni\\nor Ferentino -- nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of\\ngoing and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked\\non as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without\\ncalling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are\\nnow following -- a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among\\nthem -- reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there\\nafter seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant\\njustice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed\\nit out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a\\nresting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of\\nAlatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from\\nits railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern\\nworld, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible\\nbell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to\\nAlatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for\\na while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what\\nthey saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the\\nAlatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of\\nthe walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the arx , are the most\\nprominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond\\nour immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited\\ntown. At Alatri indeed the prim\\u00e6val walls are so prominent that in the\\ndistant view no one would suspect them of being prim\\u00e6val walls at all.\\nThey are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what\\nmay be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still\\nfence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as\\nin so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal\\nprecinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and\\ncentral character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The arx \\nis not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the\\nwall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The arx \\nforms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point\\nof the compass on the mountains which keep watch around -- on the little\\ntowns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights -- on\\nthe houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill\\nwhich the arx crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a\\nchurch or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding\\nsite, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These\\nhill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;\\nat Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their\\nheights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper\\ncompanions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which\\nsurrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more\\nworthy building, either the prim\\u00e6val temple itself or some more fitting\\nsuccessor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs -- let\\nus say either the Parthen\\u00f4n of Athens or the Parthen\\u00f4n of Lincoln to\\ndo it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral\\nchurch of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the\\n cella of the prim\\u00e6val temple. Here we have something even more than\\ncan be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way\\nof a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are\\nconcerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church\\nwas actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house\\ngoing back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded\\nage which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There\\nis the terrace, there is the wall of the cella , wrought of the same\\nwonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding arx , as the walls\\nof the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the\\nordinary rites of Christian worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a\\nChristian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples\\nof a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them\\nwithin walls reared in honour of we know not what -- gods of unchronicled\\ndays, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed\\nas strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of\\nJupiter of the Capitol.\\n\\nWhere the pr\\u00e6historic temple has thus become the cathedral church, it\\nis not out of keeping that the wall of the pr\\u00e6historic arx should\\nbecome the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see\\nfrom afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly\\nfurnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can\\ndistinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air\\nof a wall even of Roman, even of medi\\u00e6val, antiquity. Shall we say it?\\nAs we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the arx of\\nAlatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We\\ncould not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular\\nand rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than\\nat Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls\\nin the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls\\nbuilt on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business\\ncommonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,\\nto strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have\\nlittle or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached\\nfrom within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this\\narrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a\\nwall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.\\nThe weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at\\nthis point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which\\nthe hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are\\nwhich are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in\\nthe walls of Alatri, whether of temple, arx , or city, do we find\\nanything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the\\nstones, of whatever shape -- and they are of many shapes -- have clearly\\nbeen cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though\\nthe system according to which they are laid is not the same in every\\npart of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of\\nconstructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be\\nseen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it\\nis hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor\\ndo we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where\\nwe should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The\\ngreat gateway of the arx at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its\\nbuilders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of\\nthe arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of\\nthe lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. We suppose\\nthat the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge\\nlintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals\\nwhom those of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea could not have despised. But, except in vastness\\nof construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly\\nplain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with\\nthe really artistic work of the Myk\\u00eanaian treasuries. It goes rather\\nwith the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri\\ncould carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the arx .\\nBut they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great\\ngate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of\\nthe vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the\\ncut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within\\nit, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the\\nsteep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.\\nEven the builders of prim\\u00e6val walls clearly drew a line between what\\nwas meant to meet the public eye and what was not.\\n\\nBut we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,\\nthe walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of\\nAlatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect\\nin the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be\\ntempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular\\norder by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these\\nlast, except that they do not supply anything like the prim\\u00e6val gate,\\nare just as well worthy of study as the walls of the arx itself. They\\nremain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and\\nthey are of the same general construction as the walls of the arx .\\nAt some points a singular contrast is made by medi\\u00e6val additions to\\nthe defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic\\nwindows of the time, stands out as projections from the prim\\u00e6val wall.\\nAnd, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in\\nthe way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the\\nwalls themselves. From the arx of Alatri we look down on several\\nbell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is\\nquite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point\\nof Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or\\nout of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided\\nshaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow\\nstreets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory\\nin every point save one. There should have been some decent building,\\npagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its arx , the noblest\\nin our whole range.\\n\\nWith Alatri we end one main stage of our iter , that of the\\nhill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in\\nthe world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if\\nwe had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of\\nwork. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant\\nand profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and\\nthe Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns\\nare very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in\\nwithout anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to\\nmention that the Locanda d'Italia , at Anagni, recommended in various\\nguide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a\\nnight at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless\\nand letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better\\nthan many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.\\nIndeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed\\nrace. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,\\nperhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make\\nthe best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need\\nbe; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or\\nhe might be a Hernican -- we cannot always be exact among these obsolete\\nnationalities -- \\\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. From Alatri to Capua.\\n\\n\\nWe have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not\\nbe hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling\\nin historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to\\nexisting remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the\\nspecial necessities of an iter ad Brundisium carry us to quite other\\nparts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest\\nare fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they\\nare wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their\\nlowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our\\nwork is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant\\ncompanions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their\\nsubstitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond\\nit. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can\\ncarry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway\\nsystem of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea\\nand the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,\\nbeyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters\\nto the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a\\nchance likeness between the names -- a name that ranges from the Euxine\\nto the Hudson -- without seeking in any sort to identify the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of\\nDionysios and the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of imperial Anna, it is still with a curious\\nfeeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before were\\nlooking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the wilder\\nmountains of Albania.\\n\\nSome of those who now looked across had already learned something of\\nthose heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new\\nfeeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look\\nout on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the\\nwestern world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped\\nthemselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the\\nAlbanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to\\nbeing to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to\\nthe East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the\\nboot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on\\nthe western side of the great backbone of Italy; we have still to catch\\nglimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on\\nthe bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of\\ncloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which\\ndecrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must\\ngo and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time\\nwe have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive\\nrange of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass\\nfrom the prim\\u00e6val cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of\\nsouth-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series\\nof churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but\\ntheir memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,\\nnot indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days\\nwhen Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of\\nHellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those\\neastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.\\n\\nGreek influence indeed begins -- some say that it historically began -- on\\nthe western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the\\npresent journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.\\nWe hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from\\nFrosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding\\nourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be\\npassed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious\\ndiscomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that\\nit is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized\\nquarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,\\nhowever, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a\\nfew miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts -- we\\nwill not talk of luxuries -- have fled from Capua and have found their\\nnew home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,\\n Santa Maria di vetere Capua , not the newer Capua on the site of\\nCasilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there\\nagain, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in\\nthe way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far\\nin advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to\\nLondon. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.\\nThe name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early medi\\u00e6val\\nCapua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the\\ntown now called Capua, but at the village -- it is hardly more -- of Santa\\nMaria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of\\nSamnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the\\ncity where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of\\nblood.\\n\\nOn our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or\\nnew. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder\\nCapua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has\\nbeen chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the\\nhistoric traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at\\neither, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small\\nvalue in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.\\nIt is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,\\nto look again on the amphitheatre of Capua -- Capua, the mistress of\\nRome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of\\namphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,\\neven of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with\\na general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan\\namphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they\\nhardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far\\nless perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than\\nat Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman\\nColiseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,\\nwhile of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how\\nmuch is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the medi\\u00e6val\\nbarons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than\\nat Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up\\nfrom underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.\\nIf any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is\\nnot a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that\\nthe inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation\\nand enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems\\nto imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at\\nleast, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It\\nillustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the\\ntaste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.\\n\\nBesides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes\\nand designs which line the road -- one of which is indeed singularly\\nlike a model of an amphitheatre -- the true Capua has little to show\\nbesides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,\\none which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid\\nthan Rome, so utterly gone -- or rather to see the little that is left of\\nit translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we\\nbegin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,\\nremained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the\\nlast remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.\\nAs such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the\\ncity itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may\\nbe sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city\\nby the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian\\nriver, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni\\nand Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than\\nFlorence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking\\nof the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the arx of\\nCapua could have stood, if we are to understand by an arx something\\nset upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to\\nlater ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The\\nSamnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,\\nhad become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of\\nthe mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.\\n\\n \\\"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\\\"\\n\\nsays the line which comes as such a relief after the involved\\nconstructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as\\nsimply worded as it could be in a medi\\u00e6val chronicle, which gives us\\na true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without\\na single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was\\ndoubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,\\nwho had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment\\nto the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was\\nlargely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the\\nlarge amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any\\nmeasure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua\\nfor a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the\\nRoman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who\\nfilled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once\\nmore a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came\\nnot as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,\\nand when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the\\nkeeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those\\nremnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the arx of Capua, are not\\nto be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his\\nfirst or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan\\n arx , he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their\\nlowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the\\nCampanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we\\ncome to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way\\nto a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan\\namphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of\\nTifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his\\ncamp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the\\nholy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain\\nwhich rises above its massy tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.\\n\\n\\nWe reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching\\nof Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of\\nbeleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout\\nfighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his\\nlast hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the\\ndanger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in\\nsome tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks\\nwhich doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no\\nlake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend\\non Tifata as grew round -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nYet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent\\nforth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest\\nforms into which any kind of Italian or Hellenic worship strayed\\nmight well seem mild. In tracking the career of Hannibal, we are ever\\ndisappointed at the utter lack of means to call up a picture of the\\nman himself apart from his public acts. He had human weaknesses, for\\nhe found a mistress at Salapia. He had his sallies of merriment, for\\nhe could raise a laugh at the grave Gisgo. But the course of his inner\\nlife is hidden from us. Still we can at least see that he was, in his\\nown belief, charged with a mission from the gods of his own city. And\\nit needs an effort to bear in mind that the gods of Hannibal were Baal\\nand Moloch. The goddess to whom he would have reared a temple would\\nhave been, not a Diana, but an Ashtoreth. Yet, among the many, and\\nmostly false, charges of cruelty brought against the great Ph\\u0153nician\\nby Roman writers, we do not hear, as we do in the case of some other\\nCarthaginian commanders, of captives being made to pass through the\\nfire to the gods of Carthage. Hannibal, the friend of Capua, would at\\nCapua honour Diana of Tifata; but it was not Diana that had sent him.\\nWith what thanks did he honour his own gods, when Capua, second city\\nof all Italy, welcomed the victor of Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cann\\u00e6? Is\\nit too bold a flight to fancy the mount of Tifata the scene of the same\\nform of Baal-worship as the mount of Carmel?\\n\\nBut the gods of Italy lived on, undisturbed by the momentary presence\\nof Semitic rivals. Diana was not the only power worshipped on Tifata;\\nJupiter also had his holy place. And it may be that the venerable\\nchurch which now forms the chief attraction of the hill-side represents\\nthe holy place of Jupiter rather than the holy place of Diana. It is\\ncurious to see how a kind of appropriateness was often sought after in\\nthe nomenclature of Pagan temples when turned into Christian churches.\\nThus, at Athens, the Parthen\\u00f4n remained the Parthen\\u00f4n, while the temple\\nof the warrior Th\\u00easeus or H\\u00earakl\\u00eas became the church of the warrior\\nGeorge. We should look for a Santa Maria or a Santa Lucia at\\nthe least, on the site of the sanctuary of Diana. Had we here a San\\nPietro , we should have very little doubt in setting down the prince\\nof the Apostles as having supplanted the father of gods and men. But\\nat Sant' Angelo in Formis we feel somewhat less certain; St. Michael\\nsuggests the Norman, and the Norman has been there. It may well be that\\nthe name is no older than his day.\\n\\nBut St. Michael on the slope of Tifata did carry us back in thought to\\na church of St. Peter seen some months before under a widely different\\nstate of outward things. We then made a somewhat difficult journey to a\\ngreat and solitary Tuscan basilica in time of snow. The outward aspect\\nof nature had certainly changed a good deal between the bleak day in\\nJanuary when it was found a hard task to follow the way from Pisa to\\nthe basilica of the prince of the Apostles in Grado and the sunny day\\nin May when the same travellers found their way without difficulties of\\nany kind to the basilica of the prince of the archangels in Formis .\\nAnd there certainly can be no likeness of position, even if both were\\nseen in January or both in May, between the basilica standing low in\\nthe flats by the mouth of Arno and the basilica which nestles against\\nthe mountains which form a wall to the rich plain of Vulturnus. But\\nin seeing any one of these great churches, left, not ruined, like\\nour Cistercian abbeys, but still living on a kind of life in places\\nforsaken or nearly so, something always brings up the memory of some\\nother of its fellows. Aquileia is perhaps the greatest case of all; but\\nAquileia, with its special position in the history of the world, stands\\nby itself. If Aquileia itself is dead, it has lived on a wonderful\\nafter-life in the shape of its Venetian colony. We go to see Aquileia,\\nbecause it is Aquileia; but even a well-informed traveller may know\\nnothing of San Pietro in Grado and Sant' Angelo in Formis , till\\neither his guide-book or some earlier visitor points them out to him\\nas places which he ought not to pass by. Aquileia again has other\\nthings to show besides the great basilica and its surroundings. St.\\nApollinaris in Classe is as nearly forsaken as a church that is still\\nkept up can be; but the basilica of Classis does not stand by itself;\\nit forms part of the wonders of Ravenna, as St. Paul without-the-Walls\\nforms part of the wonders of Rome. St. Peter in Grado might be looked\\non as standing in the same relation to Pisa; but it hardly enters\\ninto our general conception of Pisa, as the church of Classis -- papal\\nhavoc hinders us from adding the church of C\\u00e6sarea -- certainly enters\\ninto our general conception of Ravenna. S. Angelo in Formis at all\\nevents does not enter into our general conception of old Capua, because\\nthere is not enough of old Capua left to form any general conception\\nof it at all. The church and the small surrounding village do form\\na kind of distant arx to the greater collection of houses which\\nsurrounds the amphitheatre; but among the nearer objects which catch\\nthe eye from the height, the most prominent is not old Capua with its\\namphitheatre, but new Capua, Casilinum that once was, with its towers\\nand cupolas, medi\\u00e6val and modern. We look on many things from the\\nterrace in front of the portico of the archangel, but that which among\\nartificial objects chiefly draws the eye towards it, is not the elder\\nCapua of Hannibal and Marcellus, but the Capua which succeeded Aversa\\nas the seat of the elder but the less famous of the Norman powers in\\nSouthern Italy. As we mark the advance of national union, no less than\\nas we mark the advance of mere dynastic aggression, we have sometimes\\nto think, for a moment perhaps to mourn, that \\\"kingdoms have shrunk\\nto provinces,\\\" though in this form of advance and incorporation, we\\nhave no longer to add that \\\"chains clank over sceptred cities.\\\" Capua,\\non both its sites, once the head of an Etruscan, once of a Norman\\ndominion, passed, in one age, under the universal rule of Rome. In\\nanother age it again sank from its separate headship to become a member\\nof that greater Norman dominion in Apulia and Sicily which, after\\nmore shiftings, unions, divisions, transfers to distant rulers, than\\nany other part of Europe, has in our days been merged in the realm of\\nunited Italy, with Rome as its head, but not its mistress.\\n\\nWe reach then the height which, whether that of Jupiter or Diana of\\nold, is now the height of the warrior archangel. The whole history of\\nthe church belongs to the independent days of the second Capua; in its\\npresent shape it belongs to the days of independent Norman rule in the\\nsecond Capua. But the days of independent Norman rule were days when\\nthe arts of the earlier rulers of the land still lived on. We see signs\\nof the art of Byzantium, so long mistress of Southern Italy, and of\\nthe art of the Saracen, in Italy only a visitor or an invader, while in\\nSicily an abiding master. The portico in front of the church is Roman\\nin its general idea; but, instead of the colonnade and entablature\\nof the Laurentian basilica, we see an arcade whose pointed arches at\\nonce call up memories of Sicily. They have indeed little of Sicilian\\ngrace. Nowhere at Palermo or Monreale do we see such massive columns\\nbearing such massive stilts. Columns indeed we should hardly say, as\\nsome of them are plainly mere fragments. But here, just as in Sicily,\\njust as in Aquitaine, the pointed arch is no sign of coming Gothic;\\nthe style is still wholly Romanesque, and somewhat rude Romanesque\\ntoo. And in this region of Italy we can hardly doubt as to attributing\\nthe almost accidental shape of the arches to the influence of Saracen\\nmodels, perhaps to the workmanship of Saracen craftsmen. Hard by, but\\nnot joining the building, by an arrangement unlike Sicily, unlike\\nApulia, but the common rule of Northern Italy, rises a bell-tower,\\nor rather the beginning of a bell-tower, which raises our wonder as\\nto what it would have been if it had ever grown to its full height.\\nTwo stages only are finished, the lower of hewn stone, the upper of\\nbrick; but their bulk is so great that the tower, if it had ever been\\nfinished, would surely have ranked among the highest of its class,\\nutterly overpowering even the great basilica at its side, except so\\nfar as it would have been itself overpowered by the natural heights\\nabove it. As in some other cases, the thought suggests itself, were not\\nthose who left off building the tower wiser than those who began it?\\nThe tall bell-towers of Italy look well as they rise from the Lombard\\nplain, as they crown the hill of Fiesole, as they skirt the shores of\\nthe lake of Como. But we are not sure that a gigantic tower, which, if\\nit was to have any kind of proportion, ought to have been carried up\\nto a height as great as that of Venice, was in its right place when\\nset a little way up a mountain-side, as if simply to show how small\\nman's biggest works look in the midst of the works of nature. But the\\ntechnical eye is thankful for the fragment that has been built, though\\nmainly on a very technical ground. Professor Willis is gone, but his\\nhappy phrase of mid-wall shafts has not died with him. The custom\\nof the elder Romanesque towers, the abiding fashion of Germany and\\nNorthern Italy, was to set the little columns which divided the coupled\\nwindows in the very middle of the wall; the latter Norman fashion,\\nwhether in Normandy, in England, or in Apulia, was to set them nearly\\nflush with the outer wall. In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman\\nby allegiance, two sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman\\nfashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters\\nof detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious\\nthought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise\\nbetween two rival forms of taste.\\n\\nThe outside of this church, except so far as it forms an object in\\nthe general landscape, is perhaps chiefly attractive to the technical\\nobserver; the inside will surely appeal to every visitor, though the\\nvisitor who is technically informed in matters of painting may possibly\\nlook upon it with more of curiosity than of positive admiration. But\\nthe eye of the more general inquirer will give something like positive\\nadmiration to a basilica of eight arches, resting on ancient columns\\nof various marbles, with its original design far less damaged than is\\ncommon in Italian churches, and with every inch of available space\\ncovered with elaborate paintings of the date of the building. Like\\nSt. Peter by Pisa, the archangel by Capua trusted to painting for his\\nenrichment and not to mosaics; and though the Campanian pictures are by\\nfar the better preserved of the two, though nearly all the subjects can\\nbe made out with the greatest ease, yet Ravenna and Venice rise to the\\nmind to make us think that at least if endurance be the object, there\\nis a more excellent way.\\n\\nThe walls of this church form almost a pictorial Bible, with a few\\nlegendary and local subjects thrown in. The Abbot Desiderius, holding,\\nafter the usual symbolical fashion, the church in his hand, is to be\\nseen at the east end along with the archangels and evangelists. At\\nthe west end is what connoisseurs tell us is one of the very earliest\\npictures of the Last Judgment. On the two sides a crowd of scenes and\\nfigures from the Old and New Testament cover the whole space. The style\\nof the painting is said to show Greek workmanship; we look toward the\\nwest end and mark, hardly above the ground, a single small shaft with\\na capital of strictly Byzantine character. The ruling Norman seems on\\nthis spot to have pressed into his service the artistic powers of all\\nthe inhabitants of the peninsula. Italian, Greek, Saracen, all give\\ntheir help to adorn the house of the archangel. The Norman himself\\ncontributes nothing but the position of two small columns in the tower\\nwindows. We cannot even attribute to him the position of the house of\\nthe archangel, set Norman-fashion in a high place; for the first church\\nwas built before the Norman came. It is not so further east, where a\\ndistinctively Norman element is to be seen in the great churches of\\nApulia. But the gathering together of the best skill of the time from\\nall quarters is a thoroughly Norman function, whether in Italy or in\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe basilica should be compassed, so far at least as to climb the\\nhill a little way to look at its east end. Its surrounding buildings\\nsupply an arch or two to catch the eye on the way up or down. But the\\nessential features of Sant' Angelo are the grand display of painting\\nand the union of elements of so many kinds. It is the first of a great\\nseries of churches at which our course will bid us to stop here and\\nthere. But before we reach them we shall pass by one point where our\\nmusings will again be mainly secular and largely pagan. A short journey\\nwill lead us from Campania into Samnium, and the valiant men of the\\nSamnite land will claim a tribute on a spot which is Samnite beyond all\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. A Glimpse of Samnium.\\n\\n\\nFrom Caserta and what is to be seen from Caserta, our next journey lies\\nby the line of railway which runs right across Italy, connecting the\\ntwo great lines of the east and west of the peninsula. It leads us from\\nthe Campanian plain, with at least its sheltering wall of mountains,\\nwith Tifata to guard the great city that once was from the ruder land\\nbeyond, to the great plain of Apulia from which every feature of a\\nmountain-land has passed away. But, in so crossing from one side of\\nItaly to the other, we pass through a striking and an historic region.\\nWe are in the land of the mightiest Italian rivals of Rome, the land\\nof those with whom Rome had to fight, before Pyrrhos and Hannibal came,\\nand ages after Pyrrhos and Hannibal were gone.\\n\\nOur course leads us into the heart of the Samnite land, a land which\\nmay well call up endless musings on the hard fate of those \\\"hearts of\\nsteel\\\" who bore up so long against Rome, in the days when Rome was\\nreally at her greatest. And the memories of the same land in after\\ndays are not wholly alien to those of earlier times. Our course brings\\nus, at not a few points, across the memories, if not of nations, yet\\nof men, who had to bear up against the power of Rome, when the power\\nof Rome had taken a far other form than that of the senate and the\\narmies against which the Samnite had to strive. For the old Samnite\\nland holds its place in later story, as the land of princes who felt\\nwhat the spiritual Rome could do when the powers of the spiritual\\nRome were at their highest. We pass through regions which were the\\nscene of no small part of the history of the Norman and Swabian lords\\nof Sicily and Southern Italy. We are deep in the land of the counts,\\ndukes, kings, and emperors of the house of Hauteville and the house\\nof Hohenstaufen; and we are often called on to stop and track out\\ntheir deeds. At not a few points do we light on some building, some\\ninscription, which brings up the memory of Frederick, the Wonder of\\nthe World, and of Manfred, whose field of overthrow we shall presently\\npass by. In both periods the history of these lands has a character\\naltogether different from that of Northern and Central Italy. In the\\nlater period this needs no proof: we are dealing with the history of\\na kingdom, not with the history of a system of separate cities. But\\nsomething of the same difference extends to the earlier period also. If\\nwe wish to know more of Volscians and Hernicans, yet more keenly do we\\nwish to know more of Samnites. The part which they played is greater,\\nat all events in scale, and their dealings with Rome belong to a stage\\nof Roman history when we feel that we have a kind of right to know\\nmore than we could hope to know in the earlier time. But while we know\\nsomething of the character of the Samnite people as a whole, while we\\nknow something -- though much less than in some other Italian lands -- of\\nthe geography of the Samnite country, we have no clear notion of the\\npolitical position or the political action of any particular Samnite\\ncity or canton, such as we ever and anon do get of particular cities\\nof Etruria and Latium. And again, it is seldom that we can call up\\nany distinct personal conception of any Samnite leader as a living and\\nbreathing man. This is indeed a grievance which affects Samnites along\\nwith the other Italian enemies of Rome. The personal conceptions which\\nwe do get of Etruscans and Latins largely belong to legendary times. Of\\nhistorical Volscians we know very few. And we have already complained\\non Hernican ground that we cannot picture to ourselves the personal\\nlikeness of any single Hernican of independent Hernican days.\\n\\nStill, on this particular journey we have small right to complain;\\nfor we pass by the spot which calls up the memories of the most\\nmemorable Samnites of whom we have any personal knowledge. They are\\nmen of one name, most likely therefore of one house, and men of whom\\nwe emphatically wish to know more than we do know. Leaving Caserta\\nbehind, glancing at the Campanian plain and the Campanian mountains,\\nmarking Naples only by the smoke of the distant city, we pass along\\nthrough what, in our simplicity, we take to be the vale of Vulturnus,\\ntill we light on a more classical friend, armed with a more classical\\nmap, who explains that the stream which we are tracing is in strictness\\nnot Vulturnus himself, but only his tributary Calor. Anyhow we go\\nalong its course into the heart of the Samnite land, and we pass by\\none spot -- a spot which we ought to have treated better than merely to\\npass it by, a spot round which the greatest memories of Samnite history\\ngather, and where they strangely interweave themselves with wholly\\ndifferent memories of the history of our own land. We reach Telesia,\\nthe home of the Pontii, and we remember that Telesia was also for a\\nmoment the home of Anselm. Our guide-book provokingly fails us; but\\nthe large building on the hill-side must surely be the monastery where\\nhe sojourned. There are Roman antiquities in the place; for Samnite\\nantiquities we do not look. But did Samnites build no walls, or do the\\nmighty bulwarks of Cori and Segni mark an earlier state of things than\\nthe Sabellian occupation of Southern Italy? Anyhow, we are here at the\\nplace which has attached itself as a surname to the two most memorable\\nmen in the scanty personal history of Samnium. Here, on his own\\nground, we remember that Gaius Pontius who spared Rome's army at the\\nCaudine Forks, and who lived to be led, twenty-seven years later, as a\\nspectacle in a Roman triumph, to end his days, one might almost say as\\na martyr, by the axe of the headsman in a Roman dungeon. So we used to\\nread the tale in our youth; so moralized the historians of our youth\\nover the special baseness which handed over such a man to such an end.\\nOr are we to adopt the new reading of the tale which at least saves\\nQuintus Fabius Maximus from that special stain of blood-guiltiness\\nwhich cleaves to the canonized memory of Divus Julius? It may be\\nwell if we can believe that one of the worthiest heroes of the old\\ncommonwealth, if he could not forestall the magnanimity of Pompeius and\\nAurelian, at least did not sink to the special and petty spite of the\\nmurderer of Vercingetorix. We are now taught that the Gaius Pontius\\nwho appears twenty-seven years after the first mention of that name,\\nis most likely not the same man as the merciful victor of the Caudine\\nForks. If this be so, then Quintus Fabius, in consigning his Pontius\\nto the axe, merely conformed to the cruel custom of his nation, without\\nthe further aggravation of slaying in cold blood one who had dealt with\\nRome so nobly. And after all some might hint that the oldest Pontius\\nof all was the wisest. It may be that the sage old father of Gaius\\nknew human nature best, when he bade his son either to massacre the\\nwhole Roman army or else to let them go free without terms. It may be\\nthat the son chose a more dangerous path than either, when he took to\\ndiplomacy and middle courses.\\n\\nBut if the earlier Pontius of Telesia should prove -- though the guess\\nis a simple guess -- to be in truth two Pontii, perhaps a father and a\\nson, no doubt seems to have fixed itself on the identity of the last\\nPontius at the Colline gate of Rome. The rising again of Samnite life\\nat the last moment of all, when the war with the allies seemed to have\\nlost itself in the deeper whirlpool of the war of Marius and Sulla,\\nis really the most striking thing in the whole history, such as we\\nhave it, of the Samnite people. We are taken by surprise when, in\\ndays when Rome already seems the fully established head, not only of\\nItaly, but of all the Mediterranean world, her power, her very being,\\nis threatened by the leader of a nation which seemed to have been dead\\nand buried for some centuries. But, just like the Volumnian tomb in\\none way, so the Samnite resurrection in another way is a witness to\\nthe real life which the other states of Italy kept on under a form\\nof Roman dominion which made them externally dependent, which threw\\nits influence into the scale of oligarchy in their external affairs,\\nwhich ever and anon subjected them to some irregular demand, but which\\nleft the general course of their lives to be whatever they themselves\\nchose it to be. In the days of Marius and Sulla, Etruscans and Samnites\\nwere still Etruscans and Samnites; they had not become Romans, nor had\\nthey merged their being in any common name of Italians. The Social War\\nitself was the first attempt at forming a general Italian nationality.\\nBut the last campaign of the last Pontius shows how deep, in Samnite\\nhearts at least, was the earlier feeling, the feeling which knew\\nno greater whole than the federal union of Etruria or Samnium. It\\nshows too how specially deep was the feeling of hatred for the single\\ncity which had brought down so many cities and leagues to become its\\nhelpless dependents. Against Pontius at the Colline gate Rome fought\\nfor life, as she had never fought since the old days when she had to\\nguard herself against enemies who lived within sight of her capitol.\\nForeign invaders, Pyrrhos, Hannibal himself, did not come with the\\nsame fixed purpose of rooting up the wood which sheltered the wolves of\\nItaly. We can hardly doubt that it is the hand of Sulla which from that\\nday to this has hindered the south of Italy from being like the north.\\nBut the blow which crushed the Samnite people as the other nations of\\nItaly were not crushed, was vengeance taken for a moment when it once\\nmore became a question whether Rome should rule over Italy, whether\\nRome should exist at all.\\n\\nAt Telesia we look out, and muse on what might have been, if one\\nPontius had done otherwise than he did by the forks of Caudium, if\\nanother Pontius had fared otherwise than he fared at the gates of\\nRome herself. At our next halting-place we are called on, not to muse\\non what might have been, but on what was. At Beneventum we tread the\\nbattle-ground of Pyrrhos and Manfred, the ground of two of the greatest\\nvictories of the Rome of the earlier and the Rome of the later day.\\nThere we need not strive to call up the dim figures of men, like the\\nolder and the later Pontius, known by one action of their lives. The\\nEpeirot and the Swabian stand out as clearly discerned figures in the\\nhistory of their several ages. And the places where we next halt will\\nshow us the place of overthrow for both, the place of death and utter\\nruin for one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Benevento.\\n\\n\\nWe follow the stream of Calore till we reach a city which, without\\never having been one of the great cities of the world, without having\\nbeen even one of the greatest cities of Italy, has always kept up an\\nimportant historic being. Beneventum is a familiar name in all ages;\\nyet Beneventum has never been either a mighty commonwealth like Venice\\nor Genoa, or the head of a mighty kingdom like Naples and Palermo.\\nIt has had its princes; if we never heard of them before, we should\\nlearn a good deal of them by studying the monuments of their city.\\nThat is to say, the monuments will tell us a great deal about princes\\nnine hundred or a thousand years back; no monument that we remember in\\nBenevento tells us anything about the last prince who bore their title.\\nLet us suppose a wanderer who began his travels at Autun and who finds\\nhimself, in the course of the same wandering, at Benevento. He will\\nfeel it as a grotesque coincidence that, not so very long ago, a man\\nwas living who had once been Prince of Benevento and who before that\\nhad been Bishop of Autun. Benevento, among many other things that it\\nis, is also the later city of Talleyrand, as Autun is the earlier. But\\nthere is this difference that one thinks of Talleyrand at Autun and one\\ndoes not think of him at Benevento. At Autun he has his place, though\\na very strange place, in the long succession of Bishops of Autun; at\\nBenevento, though he bore the style of its prince, he stands all alone;\\nwe cannot find a niche for him in the succession of the Beneventan\\nprinces. Yet a prince of Benevento whose existence marks the ending\\nfor a season of the long papal dominion in Benevento reminds us that\\nBenevento had its princes before that papal dominion began. It reminds\\nus of the two distinctive features in the later history of the city.\\nBenevento was first the seat of Lombard princes who, placed on the\\nborders of both empires, contrived to escape all practical submission\\nto either; it was then the seat of an outlying scrap of papal dominion\\nsurrounded on all sides by the Sicilian realm. In both these characters\\nBenevento was a kind of curiosity on the historical map of Europe. But\\nthe city had its ups and downs before those days, and amongst other\\nthings it had gone through a somewhat grotesque change of name. It is\\nhard to believe that a city placed so far inland can really have been\\nof Greek origin; but legend attributed it to a Greek founder, and its\\noldest name had a Greek sound. Greek Maloeis , Samnite Maluentum ,\\nhad, when it was read into Latin Maloventum , an ill sound; so, when\\nthe Samnite stronghold was changed into the Roman colony, it took the\\nname of Beneventum, city of welcome.\\n\\nBeneventum, marked by Procopius as a strong city in a high place,\\nstands low as compared with the true hill-cities. Still, as compared\\nwith Capua, it might itself pass for a hill-city. It has just that\\namount of rise above the river which there commonly is where there is a\\nriver, such a rise as may be seen in many an English town which is not\\nas Durham or Lincoln. We miss the prim\\u00e6val walls of the hill-cities;\\nbut we find, on the other hand, works of Roman and medi\\u00e6val art such as\\nin the hill-cities we do not find. The arch of Trajan has vanished from\\nRome, except so far as it lives in the sculptures which were torn from\\nit to enrich the arch of Constantine. But at Benevento, as at Ancona,\\nthe memorial of the conqueror of Dacia still abides. The Beneventan\\narch may indeed fairly take its place in the Roman series. It belongs\\nessentially to the same class of designs as the arch of Severus and\\nthe arch of Constantine, while it has little in common with its own\\ntall and slender fellow at Ancona. At the same time, since it has, in\\ngeneral effect at least, taken upon itself something of the position\\nof a town-gate, since it bears the name of Porta aurea , to match the\\ngolden gate of Constantinople and the golden gate of Spalato, the arch\\nof Beneventum has now a somewhat greater air of reality than triumphal\\narches commonly have. The weak point of that class of structures\\nis that they are of no use. They do not, like a wall, a gateway, a\\nhouse, a temple, a hall of council, serve any purpose in the ordinary\\neconomy of things. They are purely monumental, set up to commemorate\\nsomething or somebody, but in no way to help on men's daily affairs,\\npublic or private. And yet they are not mere monuments, like a statue\\nor an inscribed stone. A large building of this kind, having very\\nmuch the air of a building which does serve some purpose, is a little\\ndeceptive. It is so like a real gateway that it calls up the thought\\nof a real gateway, and leaves us a little disappointed at finding that\\nthe building, after all, never was of any use to anybody, and was set\\nup simply to be looked at. There is, therefore, something a little\\nunsatisfactory in the whole class of triumphal arches, and it may even\\nbe that a slightly ludicrous element is thrown in when we find that the\\nimmediate occasion for rearing this record of the life and exploits\\nof the \\\"fortissimus princeps\\\" whom it commemorates was the repair of\\nthe Appian Way. But it does not become us to find fault with any built\\nand graven monument, specially with one of a time of which we have so\\nfew written monuments as the memorable reign of Trajan. We are so much\\nthe slaves of accidental associations, so apt to draw lines at some\\naltogether unreasonable point, that we may doubt whether the reign of\\nTrajan holds the place which it should hold in popular imagination.\\nSuetonius wrote the lives of Twelve C\\u00e6sars, and this mere accident has\\ncaused the notion of a break which has no real existence between the\\nSuetonian Twelve and those who next followed them. The reign of Trajan\\nmarks the Empire at its highest pitch of extent and power, at that\\nhighest pitch which, in its own nature, comes just before the beginning\\nof decay. His days saw, too, the highest pitch of architectural\\nmagnificence; and with Tacitus and Juvenal to adorn it, one might be\\ninclined to say that, as an age of Latin literature, the age of Trajan\\nmight hold its own against any earlier period of the Imperial rule. For\\nwe must remember that the great writers of the early days of Augustus\\nare in truth writers of the republican period living on into the\\nEmpire. The Flavian period, continued under Trajan, is quite as rich as\\nthe earlier days of the Empire itself. And we may notice that the arch\\nof Beneventum marks the reign of Trajan, and with it the Roman Empire,\\nat what was really its highest point. It was raised at a time when it\\ncould commemorate conquered Dacia and tributary Armenia. That Dacia and\\nArmenia could be brought within the range of that Roman world which is\\ncontinued in the system of modern Europe is proved by daily witnesses.\\nBut the arch of Beneventum was built too early to commemorate its\\nhero's later victories in the further East, momentary victories in\\nlands which neither Alexander nor Trajan could bring within the abiding\\nrange of Western influences.\\n\\nThe arch of Trajan is so distinctly the most famous thing in Benevento\\nthat it has carried us out of all chronological order. But the\\nhistorical interest of Beneventum lies earlier and later than Trajan's\\nday. In truth the Pax Romana forbade that the main interest of any\\nItalian city should lie in Trajan's day. We may believe or not as\\nwe please in the presence of Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas and \\u00c6neas; but Pyrrhos, Hanno,\\nTotilas, and Manfred are visitors who cannot be forgotten. The city\\nhas looked out on many battles, from the overthrow of the Molossian\\nto the overthrow of the Swabian. A pleasing tale in its history is\\nwhen that Tiberius Gracchus who is the first of a name to appear in\\nRoman history led back his victorious slave-soldiers to receive the\\nreward of freedom, and to be welcomed by the rejoicing people of the\\nfaithful colony. For among the Thirty Cities of those days, the Latin\\ncolony of Beneventum was not one of the laggard twelve, but one of\\nthe faithful eighteen that were ready to endure all hardships. In\\nlater warfare the city seems to have been less steadfast. It welcomed\\nBelisarius, and in after days Totilas took it without any trouble, and\\nif he destroyed the walls it was not out of revenge for any resistance\\non the part of its inhabitants, but for fear they should supply a post\\nof defence for an imperial army. But the greatest day of Beneventum as\\nan historical city comes later than Totilas and earlier than Manfred.\\nThe memory of that day may be studied in the chief remaining buildings\\nin the city, the two greatest churches and the castle. The west front\\nof the metropolitan church, a grand example of Italian Romanesque, is\\nfurthermore a perfect chronicle of local history. There we may read,\\nbuilt up into the wall, a crowd of monumental records of the Lombard\\nprinces of Beneventum, with their deeds, especially their dealings\\nwith the dangerous power of the Franks, set forth at length. The\\nbronze doors are famous, with their long array of Scriptural subjects\\nending in a lesson in the ecclesiastical geography of the province,\\nthe figures of the Archbishop of Beneventum and his suffragans. The\\nharmony of the front is a little marred by the single low and massive\\ncorner-tower; but the inscription sums up the history of Beneventum,\\npolitical and physical, for some ages. The city was laid waste by the\\nEmperor Frederick in 1229 and by an earthquake in 1688. The tower was\\nbuilt after the first overthrow in 1279; it was restored after the\\nsecond in 1690. Destruction wrought by the elements would thus seem\\nto be more easily repaired than destruction wrought by the hand of\\nC\\u00e6sar. But it is somewhat strange to find Frederick, in his own belief\\na successor of Trajan, a follower of Trajan in Eastern conquests,\\nbranded as a destroyer in the city where Trajan's memory is cherished.\\nBut Frederick had to deal with a kind of power which Trajan knew not.\\nThe wrath of the later Emperor fell on a city which was too faithful\\nto the Roman Bishop. The course of Trajan's rule was not likely to be\\ninterfered with either by the obscure chief of the persecuted Christian\\nsect, or by any minister of the creed of which Trajan was himself chief\\nPontiff.\\n\\nWithin the church the repairs done after the earthquake have wrought a\\ngood deal of mischief. But we can still see the four ranges of columns\\nof a mighty basilica which must once have taken its place among the\\nnoblest of its class. Their capitals are a little nondescript; but\\nthey do not offend the eye; if they were certified to be of Trajan's\\nday, it would doubtless be the right thing to admire them. The ambones\\nand the Easter-light are lovely work of the early fourteenth century,\\nthe days of a real Renaissance , truer than that which followed. The\\ntreasury is rich in vestments and other precious things; but the reader\\nof Anselm's Life looks in vain for that specially gorgeous vestment\\nwhich a Beneventan Archbishop of the eleventh century bore away from\\nCanterbury in exchange for the arm of St. Bartholomew, and which made\\nits wearer the most splendid object among the assembled fathers at\\nBari. If this missing garment carries our thoughts to England, the\\nround church of St. Sophia -- hexagonal in its inner range -- carries us\\nto the Eastern world, and reminds us that there was more than one line\\nof successors of Trajan, and that Beneventum came under the influences\\nof both. The cloister, with its amazing series of capitals, its birds,\\nits elephants, its hunting scenes, may rank with those of Aosta and of\\nArles, of which that of Aosta can supply camels to match the Beneventan\\nelephants. The castle dates only from Pope John the Twenty-second, far\\naway at Avignon; we look perhaps more carefully at the older fragments\\nbuilt up in its walls and on the lion in front of it. With the lion\\nin our thoughts we may look out for other beasts, graven or molten\\nor abiding in their own relics. Procopius saw there the tusks of the\\nKalydonian boar, as in later times he might, either at Warwick or at\\nBristol, have seen the ribs of the dun cow. It is for pal\\u00e6ontologists\\nto say what it was that the Beneventan antiquaries really showed\\nhim. Failing this natural wonder we go to pay our respects to another\\nbeast whose shape is due to man's device, in quite another part of the\\ncity. A rudely carved bovine animal, in which local patriotism sees\\nthe Samnite bull -- the bull which, on the coins of revived Samnium, so\\nproudly trampled down the Roman wolf -- is now cruelly to be ruled as\\nnothing better than a monument of intruding Apis-worship. We have less\\ntime to spend at Benevento than at some other cities; but the Roman\\narches and vaults of the strange building called Quaranta Santi ,\\nthe grand Roman bridge below, must not be forgotten, and we must still\\ngive one more thought to the two mighty men whose hopes were shattered\\nat Beneventum. Manfred fell with his faithful Saracens around him;\\nPyrrhos lived to fall by a meaner end at Argos; but Beneventum ended\\nthe real career of both. It is strange how the two were in some sort\\nthe converse of each other. Pyrrhos carried the Epeirot arms into\\nSicily and southern Italy; Manfred, lord of Sicily and southern Italy,\\nestablished a Sicilian dominion on the coast of Epeiros. Korkyra,\\nCorfu, the island which has seen every master except the Turk, formed\\npart of the dominions of both alike. We leave Benevento for another\\ncity in which the East and the West of Europe, and a crowd of other\\nelements besides, meet yet more closely than they do at Benevento.\\nAt Beneventum the eye of Horace began to be caught by the well-known\\nmountains of Apulia; Procopius somewhat boldly speaks of inland\\nBeneventum as being opposite to Dalmatia. The city which we take as\\nour next chief goal, if not strictly opposite to Dalmatia, is so marked\\nas being opposite to one Illyrian port as to have sent its name, so to\\nspeak, across the Hadriatic. We will not trouble ourselves to look out\\nfor Equotuticum, or to regale ourselves with either the bread or the\\nwater of Canusium. It is to the walls of Bari, fishy Bari, that we have\\nto make our way; at Bari, Greek, Latin, Saracen, even Englishman, are\\nall at home, and Bari is opposite to Antivari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Norman Buildings in Apulia.\\n\\n\\nAt Foggia the line of railway which crosses the Italian peninsula\\nfrom Naples eastward joins the great European line which for the most\\npart skirts the Western Hadriatic shore. From Rome itself the iter\\nad Brundisium is still made by way of Beneventum; for the great mass\\nof mankind Bologna has in this matter supplanted Beneventum and Rome\\ntoo. Our eastward course across the peninsula has done for us much the\\nsame as would be done by the like course across our own island. We have\\nundergone the same change as if we had passed from Wales, Devonshire,\\nor Cumberland, to Lincolnshire or East-Anglia. We need no longer\\nlook out for hill-cities, where the first element in such cities, the\\nhills themselves, is not to be found. At Foggia we have not even the\\namount of hill which we have at Benevento. We are in the great Apulian\\nplain, the plain so precious for sheep-feeding, and the occupation of\\nwhich has more than once given rise to wars and treaties. Of Foggia\\nitself many perhaps have never heard except as a railway junction.\\nYet Foggia has a history, and its history has monuments, though we\\ncan hardly put them on a level with the monuments and the history of\\nBeneventum. The capital of Apulia, the representative of ancient Arpi,\\nhas a history in some respects the same as that of Beneventum, in some\\nother respects its opposite. Both cities claimed Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas as a founder,\\nwhile Frederick the Second, a destroyer at Benevento, appears as a\\nlater founder at Foggia. One arch of his palace still remains, with an\\ninscription telling us how under him Foggia became a royal and Imperial\\nseat. There died his English Empress Isabel, on the splendour of whose\\npassage on her way to her marriage our own historians are eloquent.\\nFurther than this, the monumental attractions of Foggia hardly go\\nbeyond what is left of its chief church. Of its front Gsell-fels, gives\\na somewhat ideal engraving, showing it, not as it is, but as it was\\nbefore earthquakes and restorers after earthquakes had combined to mar\\nit. It was -- indeed, with all mutilations, it still is -- a fine front\\nof the later Italian Romanesque, with one of the rose or wheel windows\\nwhich we must now look for wherever we go. More attractive perhaps is\\nthe crypt, with its four columns and capitals of singular beauty. They\\nsurely belong to the time of the Imperial patron of Foggia, marking as\\nthey do a kind of earlier and more healthy Renaissance , which, taking\\nclassical form as its general models, took them only as general models,\\nand did not deem itself bound slavishly to copy every turn of a leaf\\nor every section of a moulding. Such works of the carver's tool are\\nakin to those noble coins of Frederick which seem ages in advance of\\nanything that bore the image and superscription of his grandfather.\\n\\nFoggia is however less likely to strike the traveller -- at least\\nthe traveller who comes from the hill-towns by way of Capua and\\nBenevento -- by any remarkable store of ancient monuments, than as\\nbeing the first to which he will come of a series of cities, most of\\nwhich at once impress the visitor by their air of modern progress and\\nprosperity. The heel of Italy, in its cities at least, certainly seems\\nto be the very opposite to a decaying region, or even to a region which\\nstands still. To be sure, the city whose name is the most familiar\\nof all is something of an exception; Brindisi, notwithstanding its\\ndealings with the whole world, is not as Bari or even as Trani. But\\nmost of the towns at which we tarry, or which we pass by, give quite a\\ndifferent impression. We cannot tarry at all. At Barletta we get only\\na glimpse of the Imperial colossus, and therefore we do not venture\\nto hazard a guess whether it is Heraclius or any later prince whom it\\nrepresents. Along this coast, any C\\u00e6sar of the East is in his place,\\nif only as a memorial of the long, though half forgotten, time when\\nSouthern Italy bowed to the New Rome and not to the Old. But we do\\nnot let these earlier memories wholly shut out the thought of the\\nlater combat when the Horatii and Curiatii of legend found themselves\\nmultiplied by a process exactly opposite to decimation. The attractions\\nof Trani are irresistible; a bell-tower rising as proudly over the\\nwaves as that of Spalato itself would force us to halt even if we knew\\nnothing before of what church and city has to show us. The metropolitan\\nchurch of Trani is certainly one of the very noblest examples of that\\nsingular mixture of Norman and more strictly Italian forms -- not without\\na touch both of the Greek and the Saracen -- which is the characteristic\\nstyle of this region, the natural result of its political history.\\nStrange, but striking in the extreme, is the effect of the east end\\nof this church rising close above the sea; far more truly admirable\\nis the effect of the inside, where the coupled columns of the Saracen\\nhave been boldly taught to act as the piers of the great arcades,\\nand to bear up above them a massive triforium, which by itself would\\nmake us think ourselves in Normandy or England. All the churches of\\nthis district have a good deal of their strength underground, and the\\nunder-church of Trani is worthy of the building which it supports.\\nThe smaller church, All Saints', a charming little basilica with a\\nportico of singular grace, as also several good pieces of domestic\\narchitecture, and the general effect of the tower skirted with its\\ndark arcades, all join to make Trani a place which cannot be passed\\nby, though no august form calls on us, as at Barletta, to tarry to\\npay C\\u00e6sar his due homage. But Trani has found something to be said for\\nitself both by pen and by pencil in quite other company. An accident of\\nlater times gave it a right to rank, like Brindisi itself, among the\\nSubject and Neighbour Lands of Venice. And Trani has peculiarities of\\nits own. The main features of the style may be studied elsewhere. We\\nlong to see Barletta, to tarry to pay C\\u00e6sar his due. We long to stop at\\nBisceglia and Molfetta, of which we read attractive notices; but again\\nwe must pick and choose, and Bitonto is the only place on which we can\\nqualify ourselves to speak at all at large, till we come to the head of\\nthe whole region at Bari.\\n\\nBitonto shares a station with San Spirito, but it lies further away\\nfrom the railway, and that on the inland side, than most of the towns\\nalong this line. Its main interest is found in its cathedral church,\\nwhich in some points prepares us for the buildings of Bari. First\\nof all in point of wonder, though latest in point of date, is the\\ntreatment which it has undergone at the hands of modern improvers.\\nA dim remembrance comes to us that we saw something of the same kind\\nin the Dominican church at Perugia; otherwise we ask in amazement why\\nany man should think it an improvement to cut off the whole upper part\\nof a church as seen inside by thrusting in a roof a great deal lower\\nthan the original one, and thereby leaving the upper stages outside\\nto stand up in the air, serving no kind of purpose. Yet this has been\\ndone both at Bitonto and at Bari. Yet perchance the improvers of modern\\ntimes might retort on the original architects, and ask why, when they\\nhad made three apses at the east end, they presently built up a wall\\nto hide them. This is the arrangement both at Bitonto and in the two\\ngreat churches of Bari. The notion of Normans working in Italy would\\nalmost seem to have been to make an Italian front at one end, and\\nsomething approaching to a Norman front at the other end. Thus the\\nchurch of Bitonto has an excellent west front of Italian outline, with\\ndetails more Italian than Norman, and with the characteristic round\\nwindow evidently designed from the beginning, though the one which is\\nactually there must be of later date. Also there either has been or has\\nbeen meant to be a portico over the lower stage of the west front, a\\nthoroughly Italian notion. But the east end takes almost the form of\\na Norman west front; a Norman founder, it would seem, was not happy\\nunless he could somewhere or other get two towers with an ornamental\\nwall between them. To this end the apses are sacrificed. Instead of\\nthe three curved projections which form the main features of so many\\nItalian, German, and indeed Norman, east ends, the whole east end is\\nflat. The side apses are disguised by towers, one only of which is\\ncarried up to any height, while the great apse is hidden by the wall\\nbetween the towers. Herein is the difference between Bitonto and Trani.\\nAt Trani there are no eastern towers, and the apses, though of amazing\\nexternal height and no less amazing slightness of projection, are still\\nreal apses with a real curve. At Bitonto no one could know from the\\noutside that there were any apses at all. As the ordinary ranges of\\narcades and windows are thus made impossible, the architect, like an\\nEnglish architect some generations later, threw his strength into a\\nsingle east window, and certainly made one as large and as rich as was\\npossible before the invention of tracery. An elaborate round-headed\\nopening is covered with rich devices, and has wonderful monsters to\\nbear up its side-shafts. This too is to be seen at Trani, and we shall\\ncome again to other examples at Bari. There is something very strange\\nin these attempts to reconcile the ideas of Normandy and of Italy in\\none building. But in these flat east ends the result is that we get\\nsomething which is certainly neither Italian nor Norman, and which can\\nhardly be approved according to any law of either reality or beauty.\\n\\nThe same spirit of compromise goes on in other parts. The endless\\ncolumns of the under-church supply a rich study of capitals, largely of\\nthe grotesque kind. Men, monkeys, the original ram's horn, leaves, the\\nImperial eagle -- better suited for the purpose than anything else -- all\\ndo duty as volutes. The columns in the upper-church too give another\\nrich collection of various kinds of human, animal, and vegetable forms.\\nBut here a soberer spirit reigns; though perhaps no one capital is\\nstrictly classical, yet the grotesque does not reign as it does below.\\nThree arches from columns, a solid block, three more arches from\\ncolumns, make up the nave. Over these Italian elements Norman taste\\nset a triforium; modern taste has hidden the clerestory. Outside, the\\nItalian has his way in the rich open arcades of the parapets and in\\nthe windows of various forms, filled, some of them, with that kind of\\npierced tracery which is neither Italian nor Norman, but distinctively\\nOriental, and which look as if they had come -- as they possibly may have\\ncome -- from a mosque.\\n\\nAltogether there is something singularly interesting in this mixture of\\nstyles -- more strictly this mixture of two varieties of the same style,\\nfor Italian and Norman Romanesque are after all members of one great\\nartistic family. Nothing of the kind happened in Sicily, where the\\nNorman kings simply set native craftsmen, Greek and Saracen, to build\\nfor them after their several native fashions. Here, in a land where\\nGreek and Latin elements were striving for mastery, where the Saracen\\nwas a mere occasional visitor, the Norman brought in the ideas of his\\nown land to make a new element. But, if nothing like this happened in\\nSicily, something a little like it did happen in England. There is no\\ndoubt that Norman architecture was influenced, though very slightly,\\nby the earlier native style of England, a rude imitation of Italian\\nmodels. That Norman architecture in Apulia should be far more deeply\\ninfluenced by the Italian models themselves was but carrying out the\\nsame general process, as was only natural, in a far greater degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Bari.\\n\\n\\nWe are now at Barium, Bari, the original Bari of the West, as\\ndistinguished from the Bari, Bar , Antibaris , Antivari , which\\nrepeats its name on the opposite coast. There we can now again, as we\\ncould have done seventy years back at Cattaro, land at a Montenegrin\\nhaven. The distinction between the two bearers of the name of Bari\\nimplies an association which is not out of place. The historic interest\\nof Bari gathers wholly round its connexion with the lands on the\\nother side of Hadria. In earlier days the place has really no history\\nwhatever. Its most memorable day was when the powers of the Eastern\\nand Western Empires -- powers which perhaps never again worked in such\\nharmony -- were needed to dislodge a Saracen Sultan from its walls.\\n\\\"Emir,\\\" some one will say, not \\\"Sultan,\\\" and certainly we are more\\nused in Europe to Sultans of much later date than the days of Lewis\\nthe Second and Basil the First, Sultans coming from quite other lands\\nthan any that can have sent forth the Mussulman prince of Bari. But\\nhe is called Sultan as well as Emir by his one biographer, the Emperor\\nConstantine, and we cannot appeal from those august pages which still\\nform the best guide-book to the eastern shores of the Hadriatic.\\nAnyhow, the Sultan of Bari was a philosopher; he never laughed, except\\nonce when he saw a wheel go round; for that reminded him of the ups and\\ndowns of his own fortunes. Then Bari passes to the rule of the Eastern\\nEmpire; instead of a Sultan it has a Katapan, representative of the\\nEastern Augustus in that Italian dominion which had become so small\\nat the beginning of the ninth century, and which was so great again at\\nits end. Threatened again at the beginning of the eleventh century by\\nnew Saracen invaders, it is guarded by the fleets of Venice, still the\\nfaithful vassal of Constantinople against a common enemy. Seventy years\\nlater the arms of Robert Wiscard added the capital of Byzantine Italy\\nto his Norman dominion, and before the century was out, Pope Urban, the\\ngreat stirrer of the West against the Mussulman East, chose Bari as the\\nscene of the Council called to denounce at once the practical abuses of\\nthe Christian West and the dogmatic errors of the Christian East. Once\\nmore, in the next age, we find Bari looking across the sea to its old\\nlord, and chastised by the Sicilian king for its disloyalty. Add that\\nBari, before all saints, still honours St. Nicolas of the Lykian Myra,\\nand keeps his relics sacred, we are told, from Turkish desecration\\nby the craft of merchants of her own city. Altogether Bari seems, at\\nleast in its history, as much Greek as Italian or Norman. It would seem\\nneither unnatural nor unpleasant if Greek were still the tongue of the\\nseafaring folk of Bari, much as a Norman in his own land often carries\\nan air about him which would make Danish seem a much more natural\\nspeech for him than French.\\n\\nBut the great buildings of Bari belong to that mixed Norman and\\nItalian style of which we have already seen something at Bitonto. The\\narchitectural attractions of the city are chiefly to be found in two\\ngreat churches and one smaller one. The castle, standing by the sea,\\nshould have its landward side walked round, and the walk will reveal\\nmuch of picturesque outline and a little of good detail. But it is\\nthe churches, above all the great abbey of St. Nicolas, which are the\\nglory of Bari. They all lie in the old town by the sea, the old town\\nof narrow and crooked streets, in which it does not much matter which\\nway you go; you are sure to come either to the castle or to one of the\\nchurches before very long. Very different are things in the new town,\\nwhich we may rejoice in as we look at it as a sign of Bari's abiding\\nor renewed prosperity, but which can raise no feelings of pleasure on\\nany other ground. Its streets, crossing each other at right angles, are\\nindeed carefully dedicated to the worthies of Bari; but, unless we can\\nalways remember which of several perhaps not very familiar worthies\\nwatches over each of several angles which are exactly alike, it is\\neasy to take a wrong turn and to put oneself under the care of Andrew\\nof Bari when we ought rather to be commending ourselves to Robert.\\nAnd under either protection we yearn in the wide straight streets\\nfor some physical shelter from the Apulian sun, and wonder why modern\\nRome, modern Athens, and modern Bari should have so much less common\\nsense than Bologna, Padua, and Corfu had in days long past. Still,\\namid this rectangular labyrinth the sea is a help on one side, while\\non another the tall tower of the metropolitan church of St. Sabinus\\nbeckons us into the older streets, whose narrowness and crookedness\\nat least supply shade. That tower, one of the tallest and stateliest\\nof Italy, we naturally assume to be a detached campanile, without a\\nfellow and standing apart from its confederate buildings, church and\\nbaptistery. So it doubtless would be in a purely Italian city; but\\nhere we are in the city where the Norman displaced the Greek. The\\ntwo great churches of Bari, like that of Bitonto, have their towers\\nwrought into the building in Norman fashion, and at the duomo the\\ngreat round baptistery is also merged in the same mass with the church\\nand its towers. Both of the great churches of Bari have east ends\\nof the same kind as that at Bitonto; the apses are swallowed up; the\\nplace where the great apse should be is marked by a single splendid\\nRomanesque window. The eastern towers of St. Nicolas have never been\\ncarried up; at St. Sabinus the southern one has perished, but the\\nnorthern one still soars in all its majesty, thoroughly Italian in its\\nconception, but rather to be called Norman in its detail. St. Nicolas\\nhas also another pair of unfinished towers at its west end, standing\\nat once beyond the aisles as at Wells and Rouen, and in front of them\\nas at Holyrood. They flank a grand Italian front which one would think\\nwould be finer without them. These western towers are absent in the\\nmetropolitan church; but that has a most perfect octagonal cupola\\nover the crossing, the grouping of which with the two lofty eastern\\ntowers, if there was any point from which it could really be seen,\\nmust have been wonderful. Thus, in both churches, something of a German\\noutline has either been consciously brought in or has been incidentally\\nstumbled on. The four towers of St. Nicolas, the octagon and eastern\\ntower of St. Sabinus, will easily find Rhenish fellows, though we\\nshould perhaps have to go as far as Angoul\\u00eame for a single tower of\\nequal majesty mourning over a vanished brother. In other points the\\nexternal arrangements of the two great churches of Bari have much\\nin common. The rose windows, the coupled windows, the blank arcades,\\nare much the same in both. So is the choice of animal forms for the\\nfanciful supports of columns. In most places the lion discharges that\\nfunction -- in a building designed by lions we should doubtless see\\nsomething different. So we do here at Bari, where the solid forms of\\nthe pachydermata are, perhaps discreetly, preferred to the lighter\\n carnivora . The elephant, we think, is to be found in both churches,\\nand the huge earth-shaking beast is represented so as to remind us both\\nof Pyrrhos and of Hannibal; some have the smaller ear of India, some\\nthe larger of Africa. The hippopotamus appears only in the west front\\nof St. Nicolas. Had the daring shipfolk who bore away the saint's bones\\nfrom Lykia made their way to the Nile also?\\n\\nWhen we pass the threshold of the two buildings we see that their fate\\nin modern times has been very different. St. Sabinus has suffered much\\nas Bitonto has suffered. The upper part of the building is hidden\\nin just the same fashion, and ugly tricks have been played with the\\ncolumns and their capitals. St. Nicolas, on the other hand, has been\\nleft comparatively alone. The chief changes which it has undergone\\nmust have taken place not very long after the original building. The\\noriginal plan was much the same as that of Bitonto -- three arches from\\ncolumns, a massive pier, then three more arches from columns. But this\\narrangement was disturbed at an early time by throwing three spanning\\narches across the nave. The effect is so striking that we can hardly\\nregret their presence; but it is perfectly easy to see that they are\\ninsertions, and, though they are essentially of the same style, yet\\nthey differ in their details from the original columns. These last all\\napproach more or less to the Corinthian type; in the under-church the\\npatterns are more varied. Here are still the wonder-working relics of\\nSt. Nicolas, and the balsam or \\\"manna\\\" which flows from them may still\\nbe drunk. In the duomo the under-church has been restored out of all\\nancient character, but it still keeps an ancient Byzantine picture.\\n\\nAs so often happens, the secondary church of Bari altogether surpassed\\nthe mother church in historic fame and local honour. To ourselves the\\nfact in its history which comes home most nearly is that it was here\\nthat Urban held his Council, here that Anselm, to the satisfaction\\nof all Western minds, refuted the creed of the East, here that he\\ninterceded with the Pontiff and the assembled fathers on behalf of the\\nking who had wronged him. Here too it was that the keen eye of English\\nEadmer spied out on the shoulders of the Archbishop of Beneventum the\\nsplendid cope which is no longer to be seen at Beneventum. Such little\\ntouches in those days often brought the ends of the world together\\nin a way to which, in our days of more general intercourse, nothing\\nanswers. When French was the polite language alike at Dunfermline and\\nat Jerusalem, when the Latin-speaking clerk was at home in any corner\\nof the West, when the few men of the West who had learned Greek spoke\\nit so that a Greek could understand them, when men passed to and fro\\nbetween the civil services of England and Sicily, communication between\\ndistant parts of Europe was in some ways easier than it is now. Bari,\\none of the chief places for setting out on crusades, must for a long\\ntime have been a thoroughly cosmopolitan city. We do feel that the ends\\nof the earth have combined to meet at Bari, when we find the place\\nof honour in the church of St. Nicolas at Bari held by a princess of\\nBari, who became Queen of the greatest Slavonic kingdom. Emblematic\\nfigures of Bari and Poland support the tomb of Queen Bona, and her\\nepitaph describes her husband Sigismund, the first of that name, as not\\nonly the mighty King of Poland, but Grand-Duke of Lithuania, Russia,\\nPrussia, Mazovia, and Samogitia. Yet we might have lighted on Slavonic\\nassociations earlier on the road. There is a strange record of a\\nBulgarian settlement in the parts of Beneventum; but that would take us\\nyet further afield: it was before Bulgarians became Slavonic. But what\\nare we to say to the Samnite Schiavia which sheltered Anselm?\\n\\nThe journey is done -- \\n\\n\\\"Brundisium long\\u00e6 finis cart\\u00e6que vi\\u00e6que.\\\"\\n\\nOtranto lies yet further; but Otranto, yet more notably than Bari,\\ncomes within the Venetian Notitia . So does Brundisium, city of the\\nstag's horn, of the haven so aptly called, if we only knew in what\\ntongue it is that Brentesium has that meaning. But we are tempted\\nto regret that Brindisi and not Otranto is the point for which Hadria\\nhas to be crossed. Brindisi has no moral claim. We cannot look thence,\\nas we can from Otranto, upon the mountains of still enslaved Epeiros;\\nno one is tempted even to dream that he looks on free Corfu or on the\\nlesser satellite that stands in front as its outpost.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"But if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Freeman\\nPublisher: G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS\\nPlace of publication: New York / London\\nDate: 1893\\n\\nArezzo.\\n\\n\\nThe city of M\\u00e6cenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,\\nshows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There\\nis some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,\\nand, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief\\nbuildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be\\nbought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among\\nthem surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that\\nclear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with\\nnourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different\\nways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having\\nyet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if\\nthe city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the\\nfirst rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both\\nforms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of\\nPisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect\\nof the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim\\na day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from\\nFlorence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.\\n\\nArezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities\\nwhich sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,\\nlike Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.\\nIt has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which\\npresently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself\\nin the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have\\nto be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect\\nof the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we\\ninstinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as\\na whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs\\nsome of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem\\nto borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it\\nwere covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several\\nsmall hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all\\nsides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast\\nsnowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the\\ncharacter of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a\\ngood deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a\\ngeneral view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to\\nthe left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must\\nclimb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean\\nfortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has\\ngardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about\\nat large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in\\nthe general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line\\nof the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except\\nwhere they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;\\nsurely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this\\nobject. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly\\ntheir whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit\\nit is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest\\nin some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show\\nside. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern\\nrailway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually\\ndescending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the\\ninhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from\\nopen fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it\\nis with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral\\nand the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without\\ntaking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of\\nArezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give\\nus either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of\\nmedi\\u00e6val towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect\\nin Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription\\nwhich illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed\\nsovereign Cosmo appears as \\\"Duke of Florence and Siena.\\\" He had\\ninherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;\\nmeanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the\\nhigher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.\\n\\nIn the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one\\ndominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral\\nchurch, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the\\ntown, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the duomo \\nis the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant\\nfeature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises\\namong a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of\\nthem, the great campanile of St. Mary della Pieve , though the body\\nof its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to\\nthe cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not\\nungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest\\narchitectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show\\nitself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and\\nthe town-tower, and that hard by the duomo ; but they do not hold,\\neven comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows\\nin the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a\\ncity which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical\\ncharacter was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of\\nArezzo, keeps -- though not on its old site -- his splendid tomb in the\\n duomo , on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles\\nwhich he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown\\nat his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of\\nhouses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building\\nbesides the churches is the front of that called the Fraternit\\u00e0 dei\\nLaici , in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of\\nArretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,\\nbut so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,\\nit contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show\\nin many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are\\nthe huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other\\nvast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.\\nNaturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones\\nwere no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as\\nrelics of the G\\u00e6tulian beasts of Hannibal.\\n\\nSomething may be picked up here and there in the other churches of\\nArezzo; but it is Santa Maria della Pieve which is the real object\\nof study. The duomo is absolutely without outline; it is a single\\nbody with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.\\nBut its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than\\nis common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the\\nGerman hand to which tradition attributes the building. The church of\\n La Pieve is of a higher order. It has real shape within and without.\\nIts four arms should support a cupola, only the cupola has never been\\nfinished; the apse is in the very best form of the Italian Romanesque;\\nthe west front is called a copy of Pisa; but neither its merits nor\\nits defects seem borrowed from that model. Part of it is sham, which\\nnothing at Pisa is, while the small arcades stand out free, as at\\nLucca, but not at Pisa. The front is a wonderful display of column\\ncapitals of all kinds, from the Corinthian column used up again in its\\nlowest range to the fantastic devices of the small ranges above them.\\nThe arch and the entablature are both used; so they are in the apse: so\\nthey are within. For the choir has a real triforium, and that triforium\\nshows this strange falling back on the construction of the Greek. The\\narches below are round; those which should support the cupola, as well\\nas those of the nave, are pointed, the latter rising from columns of\\nprodigious height. The internal effect is like nothing else; it is\\nquite un-Italian; it is as little like anything English or French;\\nthe arches, but not the columns, suggest the memory of Aquitaine. The\\nsouth side has been rebuilt. Perhaps the work was physically needful:\\nbut it has involved the destruction of the substructure of the ancient\\nbuilding on the site of which the church stands. The columns in the\\nwest front seem to be the only remains of Arretium as distinguished\\nfrom Arezzo. The \\\"Tyrrhena regum progenies\\\" have here left but small\\ntraces behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCortona.\\n\\n\\nFrom Arezzo the next stage will naturally be to the hill on whose height\\n\\n ... Cortona lifts to heaven\\n Her diadem of towers.\\n\\nIf the journey be made on a market or fair day, the space between the\\nwalls and the station at Arezzo may be seen crowded with white oxen,\\nsuggesting the thought of triumphs and triumphal sacrifices. Their\\nrace, it was said, prayed to the gods that Marcus and Julian might not\\nwin victories which would lead to their destruction. And the prayer\\nseems to have been answered, as the breed specially connected with\\nClitumnus has clearly not died out, even by the banks of Clanis. The\\njourney is not a long one; yet, if we had time to see everything, we\\nmight well wish to break it, as we pass by the hill of Castiglione\\nFiorentino, with its walls and towers. That strong and stern\\nhill-fortress comes in well between Arezzo and Cortona. Arezzo covers\\na hill, but it can hardly be said to stand on a hill-top; Castiglione\\ndistinctly does stand on a hill-top; Cortona sits enthroned on a height\\nwhich it would hardly be straining language to speak of as a mountain.\\nWe have now come to a site of the oldest class, the stronghold on the\\nheight, like Akrokorinthos and the Larissa of Argos. But at Argos and\\nCorinth the mountain-fortress became, at a later stage, the citadel of\\nthe younger city which grew up at the mountain's foot. But at Cortona,\\nas at greater Perugia, the city still abides on the height; it has\\nnever come down into the plain. So it has remained at Laon; so it has\\nbecome at Girgenti, where the vast lower space of the later Akragas\\nis forsaken, and the modern town has shrunk up within the lines of\\nthe ancient acropolis. From the ground below Cortona we look up to a\\ncity like those of old, great and fenced up to heaven; the \\\"diadem\\nof towers\\\" is there still, though it is now made up of a group of\\ntowers, ecclesiastical, municipal, and military, none of them of any\\naccount in itself, but each of which joins with its fellows to make\\nup an effective whole. At Cortona indeed, as at Argos and Corinth,\\nthere is an upper and a lower city, and the upper city is pretty well\\nforsaken. But while at Argos and Corinth the lower city stands in the\\nplain, and the acropolis soars far above it, at Cortona the lower city\\nitself stands so high up the hill that it is only when we reach it\\nthat we fully understand that there is a higher city still. The site\\nitself belongs so thoroughly to the oldest days of our European world\\nthat there is a certain kind of satisfaction in finding that the main\\ninterest of the place belongs to those oldest days. We are well pleased\\nthat everything of later times is of quite a secondary character, and\\nthat the distinctive character of Cortona is to be the city of the\\nEtruscan walls.\\n\\nIn truth, a certain degree of wonder is awakened by the fact that\\nCortona exists at all. It would have been by no means amazing if we had\\nfound only its ruins, as on so many other old-world sites for which\\nlater times have found no use. Great in its earliest days, foremost\\namong the Etruscan cities of the mountains, Cortona has never been\\ngreat in any later age. As a Roman city and colony it was of so little\\naccount that, even in Italy, where bishops are so thick upon the\\nground, it did not become a bishopric till the fourteenth century. Just\\nat that time came its short period of anything like importance among\\nthe cities of medi\\u00e6val Italy. Sold to Florence early in the fifteenth\\ncentury, it has ever since followed the fortunes of the ruling city.\\nYet through all these changes Cortona has managed to live on, though\\nwe can hardly say to flourish. It still keeps the character of a\\ncity, though a small and mean one, inhabited by a race of whom the\\nyounger sort seem to have nothing to do but to run after the occasional\\nvisitor. One ragged urchin offers to accompany him to the cathedral;\\nanother persists in following him round nearly the whole circuit of the\\nancient walls. This last is too bad; a walk round the walls of Cortona\\nis emphatically one of those things which are best enjoyed in one's own\\ncompany.\\n\\nAs an Italian city which has lived, though in rather a feeble way,\\nthrough the regular stages of Roman colony and medi\\u00e6val commonwealth,\\nCortona has of course its monuments which record those periods of\\nits being. There are some small fragments of Roman work, but nothing\\nthat can be called a Roman building. There is a crowd of churches and\\nmonasteries, but none of any great architectural value, though some\\ncontain works of importance in the history of painting. It perhaps\\nmarks the position of Cortona as a comparatively modern bishopric that\\nits cathedral church is in no sort the crowning building of the city.\\nThe duomo stands about half-way up the height within the town, on\\na corner of the walls. Its elegant Renaissance interior has been\\nalready spoken of; it seems to have supplanted a Romanesque building\\nthe columns of which may have been used again. The point in the upper\\ncity where we should have looked for the duomo is occupied by the\\nChurch of St. Margaret, that is, Margaret of Cortona, described over\\nher portal as \\\"p\\u0153nitens Margarita,\\\" marked off thereby alike from\\nthe virgin of Antioch and from the matron of Scotland. The municipal\\nbuildings are not remarkable, though one wall of the Palazzo Pretorio\\nmust be a treasure-house for students of Italian heraldry, thickly\\ncoated as it is with the arms of successive podestas . Of private\\npalaces the steep and narrow streets contain one or two; but it is not\\non its street architecture that Cortona can rest its claim to fame.\\nFrom the lower city, with its labyrinth of streets, we may climb to the\\nacropolis. Here, around the Church of St. Margaret, all seems desolate.\\nThe Franciscan convent on the slope below it lies in ruins -- not an\\nusual state for an Italian building. The castle above, fenced in by its\\nditch, seems as desolate as everything around, save the new or renewed\\nfabric of St. Margaret's. This height is the point of view to which\\nthe visitor to Cortona will be first taken, if he listens to local\\nimportunity. A noble outlook it is; but the traveller can find points\\nof view equally noble in the course of the work which should be done\\nfirst of all -- that of compassing the mighty wall which is the thing\\nthat makes Cortona what it is.\\n\\nThe process of going to the back of the city, which may be done in\\nsome measure at Arezzo, may be done in all its fulness at Cortona.\\nHappily, very nearly the whole wall can be compassed without, and in\\nby far the greater part of its course more or less of the old Etruscan\\nrampart remains. In many places the mighty stones still stand to no\\nsmall height, patched of course and raised with work of later times,\\nbut still standing firmly fixed as they were laid when Cortona stood\\nin the first rank among the cities of the Rasena. Not that there is\\nreason to attribute any amazing antiquity to these walls. We must\\nremember that the Etruscan cities kept their local freedom till the\\ndays of Sulla, and that some Etruscan works are later than some Roman\\nworks. The masonry is by no means of the rough and early kind; yet the\\none remaining gate, unluckily blocked, is square-headed, and might\\nalmost have stood at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. On the highest point, the hindermost\\npoint, the wildest and most desolate point, where, though just outside\\nan inhabited city, we feel as if we were in a land forsaken of men,\\nthe Etruscan wall has largely given way to the medi\\u00e6val fortress whose\\npresent aspect dates from Medicean days. But it has given way only\\nto leave one of the grandest pieces of the whole wall standing as an\\noutpost in the rear of the city, overhanging the steepest point of\\nthe whole hill. The Etruscan wall, the Medicean castle, one seemingh\\nto stand as forsaken and useless as the other, form a summary of the\\nhistory of Cortona in stone and brick.\\n\\nFrom the walls we may well turn to the Museum, to see the tombs and\\nthe other relics of the men who reared them. Pre-eminent among them,\\nthe glory of the Cortonese collection, as the Chim\\u00e6ra is the glory\\nof the Florentine collection, is a magnificent bronze lamp, wrought\\nwith endless mythological figures. Near it stands the painting of a\\nfemale head, which we might at first take for the work of Renaissance \\nhands, and in which those who are skilled in such matters profess to\\nrecognize the existing type of Cortonese beauty. The painting however\\ndates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps\\nher ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their\\nskulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her\\npresent people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features\\nwere copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living\\ncountenance of one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerugia.\\n\\n\\nThe hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of medi\\u00e6val Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmedi\\u00e6val and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch's \\\"Life of Timole\\u00f4n,\\\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr\\u00e6historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi\\u00e6val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.\\n\\nThe difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the\\nabiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical\\ndifference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if\\nwe will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of\\nPerugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona\\nsits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but\\non a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several -- possibly\\nseven -- outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.\\nThe Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of\\na very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and\\noutlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is\\nonly in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain\\nthe present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that\\nwe can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly\\na hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,\\nwhile the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.\\nBut Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the\\nplain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it\\nhas happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona\\nis not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long\\nperiod of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all\\nthe way from its railway station to its municipal palace.\\n\\nAt Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws\\nto itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\\n\\nPerugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as\\nreceptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked\\non. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At\\nthe two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on\\nthe Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.\\nAngelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long\\nseries of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to\\nLudlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with\\nits beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one\\nof the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other\\nend, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble\\nranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building\\nat its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the duomo \\nitself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it\\nshows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and\\nits pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not\\nchurches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from\\nother things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one\\nclass alone -- Augusta Perusia itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Volumnian Tomb.\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern\\nFreemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the\\nouter world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have\\nread various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,\\nits constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us\\nthe fullest particulars: we have only to complain that the historical\\npart is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should\\nnot like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient\\nin the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty\\nany further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact\\nduties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we\\nshould answer, not \\\"Amen,\\\" but \\\"So mote it be.\\\" Still, what Freemasonry\\nis, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a\\nFreemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books\\nleave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to\\nknow everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can\\nknow a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom\\nwe seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as\\nto the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,\\nand belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their\\nbuildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they\\nlived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan\\nbooks; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless\\ninscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language\\nwas, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,\\nhalf-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as\\nthe mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here\\nand there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one\\ningenious man has read it all into good German and another into good\\nTurkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like\\na Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything\\nin three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light\\non a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For\\nsurely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead\\nletter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,\\nbut at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.\\n\\nIt is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments\\nof a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part\\nof the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the\\ncollections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if\\nwe are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or\\nshall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly\\nEtruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes\\nlargely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this\\nmust specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have\\nleft no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly\\nfair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like\\nthe Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But\\nsuppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have\\nin the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek\\nor Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral\\nelement would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly\\ndominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be\\nso distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.\\nTake a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does\\nnot of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference\\nto the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven\\non the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in\\nthe Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye\\nand the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than\\neven the chim\\u00e6ra, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various\\nsizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.\\nThe departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the\\nuninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance\\nto divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is\\ndesigned to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the\\n Lucumonissa -- if we may coin so medi\\u00e6val a form -- lies apart, sometimes\\nalong with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to\\nbring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious\\nrace than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.\\n\\nBut if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near\\nPerugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to\\nbe forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\\n\\nWe are not describing at length what may be found described at length\\nelsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures\\nwhich gives them a strange and special interest. This is their\\nstrangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but\\nso are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch\\nof Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo\\nreclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly medi\\u00e6val recumbent\\nfigure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,\\nsay in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures\\non the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give\\nus living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the\\nRasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient\\nworks which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.\\nAnd nowhere do the sculptures look fresher -- almost modern -- than when\\nseen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the\\nsepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi.\\n\\n\\nThere is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of\\nmischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite\\ndifferent from that which makes the place famous with the world in\\ngeneral. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious\\nerror. When so many members of Parliament showed a few years back,\\nand when the Times showed only a very little time back, that they\\nbelieved that the University of Oxford was founded by somebody -- Alfred\\nwill do as well as anybody else -- and that the city of Oxford somehow\\ngrew up around the University, it became, and it remains, a duty to\\nhistoric truth to point out the importance of Oxford, geographical and\\ntherefore political and military, for some ages before the University\\nwas heard of. When the Times thought that Oxford was left to the\\nscholars, because \\\"thanes and barons\\\" did not think it worth struggling\\nfor, the Times clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford\\nthen, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because\\nOxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,\\nflourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat\\nof councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;\\nin other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,\\nwhile the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly\\nworthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects\\nwhich are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible\\nthat some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the\\nchurch and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the\\nerror is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the\\ncity of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis\\nand his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and\\nworld-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully\\nworthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on\\nages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place\\nwell worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and\\nthough his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light\\nmatter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very\\nunlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before\\nhim and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace\\nof the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called\\n\\\"seraphica civitas,\\\" before one of its later churches came to rank with\\nthe patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early\\nmedi\\u00e6val city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still\\nexist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a\\nkind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The\\nsaint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could\\nhe have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,\\nand doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow\\nstream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral\\nchurch of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the\\nGreat Twin Brethren.\\n\\nAssisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless\\nvarieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which\\nwe have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on\\nwhich it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge\\nmountain. As at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea, while the akropolis is high enough, there is\\nsomething far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis\\nof Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of\\nshelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The duomo \\nstands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top\\nof the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is\\nno small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the\\nremains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond\\nit, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling\\nof man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost\\nmore needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not\\nonly for the medi\\u00e6val walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark\\nan outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow\\nvalley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at\\ntheir feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the\\nglimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only\\nless wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb\\nfrom the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but\\nthere the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes\\nall the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,\\ngives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure\\nto the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a\\ncity running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of\\nbell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general\\neffect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,\\ncrowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except\\nthe steep of the mountain itself.\\n\\nOf particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a\\nrestriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,\\nSaint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest\\ninterest is the temple in the forum -- now Piazza grande -- with its\\nCorinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on\\nthe other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned\\ninto a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple\\nof Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting\\npart of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at\\nAssisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple\\nmust have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper\\nones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,\\nwith the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on\\nthe Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those\\ncomments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient\\nJewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the\\nsynagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is\\nthe dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,\\nand the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates\\nand people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great\\ncollection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it\\ndown quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the\\ndedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number\\nof inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,\\nthere are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best\\nworth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and\\noculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of\\nthe Sexviri for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,\\nand left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly\\nbrought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his\\ncoachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are\\nset thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of\\nforeign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and\\non the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements\\nwere practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of\\nAssisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less\\ngood a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.\\n\\nThe temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most\\nmemorable things in Pr\\u00e6-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things\\nbesides, both Roman and medi\\u00e6val. The lower church of Sta. Maria\\nMaggiore , close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been\\nthe original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German\\nlook, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into\\nthe mind that it is the cella of a temple with arches cut through\\nits walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local\\nfashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter\\nhard by. Besides, at Sta. Maria Maggiore there are the clear remains\\nof a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,\\nunderneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has\\nbeen sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth\\ncentury, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,\\nand it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the\\ncrypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,\\nand Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above\\nare scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier\\nremains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the\\nsurrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman chester \\nabide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is\\nmodern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the Via San Paolo \\nleading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above\\nground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many\\nmemorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in\\nclimbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while\\nboth Saint Francis and Saint Clara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpello.\\n\\n\\nThe Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many\\ngates its full description as \\\"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia\\nCostante,\\\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum\\nor as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most\\nlikely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in\\none of its churches. Somebody must come to see them, or their keepers\\nwould not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them\\ncovered, in hopes of earning a lira by uncovering them. May we make\\nthe confession that we became aware -- or, to speak more delicately,\\nthat we were reminded -- of the existence of the colony at once Julian\\nand Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German\\nguide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel\\nthoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,\\nyet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and\\nthat, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman\\nmonuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more\\nperfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the\\nwonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we\\nshould hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;\\nbut a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is\\nno one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but\\nthere are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some\\nimportance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the\\nplace, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as\\nSpello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less\\nuntouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.\\nWe except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the medi\\u00e6val\\nhouses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.\\nBut that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong\\nin some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at\\nSpello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to\\nseize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the\\nfinest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains\\nand ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,\\nand the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers\\nand cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The medi\\u00e6val walls and towers,\\nat all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not\\neasily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the\\nantiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in\\nmere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps\\na little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not\\ndisappointing.\\n\\nAt Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;\\neven in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one\\nhand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no duomo , nor is\\nthere any other church of much architectural importance. The best are\\ntwo small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each\\nside of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building\\nof a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group\\nlying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There\\nis a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;\\nby its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the\\namphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with\\nits marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre\\nis down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the\\npresent city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original\\nRoman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever\\nthe influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed\\nwith so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from\\nSpello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments\\nwhich are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the\\nbuilding is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of\\nits bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;\\nother fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when\\nwe reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it\\nis its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.\\n\\nAs we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia\\nConstans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which\\nbears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the\\nconsular gate is reached only through a medi\\u00e6val one, which bears, as\\nwe have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the\\nstranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:\\nfor Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty\\nof climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in\\ncontinuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been\\npatched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single\\nsimple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to\\nthe lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,\\nknown as Porta Veneris , must have been a far more elaborate design.\\nBut the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double\\nentrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet\\nthere is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal\\ntowers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,\\nhigher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch\\nhanging in the air. This is locally known as the arco di trionfo . Of\\nthe arco di Augusto within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of\\nMacrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman\\nremains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and\\nfragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them\\nout. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival\\nVerona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain\\nperverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what\\nhas been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the\\nend of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match\\nthe mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one\\njourney. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to\\nspend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must\\nhurry on to aurea Roma herself, even though we have to rush by many a\\ntown and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest\\nof all, by\\n\\n ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,\\n The fortress of Nequinum lowers\\n O'er the pale waves of Nar.\\n\\nMarry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,\\npresents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to\\nhave come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the\\nRoman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Qu\\u00e6stor Bacchus -- it\\nis taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot\\nhelp Latinizing the Questore Bacco -- puts out another set of placards\\nto forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among\\nour memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a\\nsecession; we might almost expect to see once more\\n\\n ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.\\n\\nBut those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede\\neven to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the Sala\\nDante .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVeii.\\n\\n\\nThe student of what M. Amp\\u00e8re calls \\\"L'Histoire Romaine \\u00e0 Rome\\\" must\\ntake care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history\\nof Rome -- and the local history of Rome is no small part of the\\n\\u0153cumenical history -- is not fully understood unless we fully take in\\nthe history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.\\nWith Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and\\nher allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made\\npart of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And\\nfirst on the list may well come the city which was before all others\\nthe rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of\\ndestruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through\\na country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with\\nthe heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has\\nutterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left\\nwithin the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we\\nare close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by\\na rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,\\nan inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the\\nfirst great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'\\nsiege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the\\nHellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such\\nas are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of\\nliving things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria\\nnothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some\\nconvulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,\\nand tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a\\nrace with whom death counted for more than life.\\n\\nA sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand\\nsome points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival\\nof Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,\\nwe understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the\\nhatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked\\non the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange\\na greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the\\ngreat border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate\\nneighbours which could contend with her on equal terms. Elsewhere, in\\nher early history, Rome, as a single city, is of equal weight in peace\\nor war with whole confederations.\\n\\nThe happy position of certain hills by the Tiber had enabled one lucky\\ngroup of Latin settlements to coalesce into a single city as great\\nas all the others put together. But at Veii we see the marks of what\\nclearly was a great city, a city fully equal in extent to Rome. And\\nwhen the ancient writers tell us that, in riches and splendour, in the\\ncharacter of its public and private buildings, Veii far surpassed Rome,\\nit is only what we should expect from a great and ancient Etruscan city\\nwhich had entered on the stage of decline when Rome was entering on the\\nstage of youthful greatness. There was little fear of Veii overthrowing\\nRome; but both sides must have felt that a day would come when Rome\\nwould be very likely to overthrow Veii. Two cities so great and so near\\ntogether could not go on together. Two cities, very great according\\nto the standard of those times, considerable according even to a\\nmodern standard, cities of nations differing in blood, language, and\\neverything else which can keep nations asunder, stood so near that the\\nmodern inquirer can drive from one to the other, spend several hours\\non its site, and drive back again, between an ordinary breakfast and\\ndinner. Rivalry and bitter hatred were unavoidable. Veii must have felt\\nall the deadly grief of being outstripped by a younger rival, while\\nRome must have felt that Veii was the great hindrance to any advance of\\nher dominion on the right bank of her own river. No form of alliance,\\nconfederation, or dependence was possible; a death struggle must come\\nsooner or later between the old Etruscan and the newer Latin city.\\n\\nThe site of Veii is that of a great city, a strong city, but not a city\\nmade, like Rome, for rule. We go far and wide, and we find nothing\\nlike the \\\"great group of village communities by the Tiber.\\\" Veii is\\nnot a group, and she has no Tiber. The city stood high on the rocks,\\nyet it can hardly be called a hill-city. A peninsular site rises above\\nthe steep and craggy banks of two small streams which make up the\\nfateful Cremera; but the peninsula itself is nearly a table-land, a\\ntable-land surrounded by hills. The stream supplied the walls with an\\nadmirable natural fosse, and that was all. The vast space enclosed by\\nthe walls makes us naturally ask whether the city could have been laid\\nout on so great a scale from the beginning. We may believe that, as\\nin so many cases, the arx , a peninsula within a peninsula, was the\\noriginal city, and that the rest was taken in afterwards. But, if so,\\nit would seem as if it must have been taken in at a blow, as if Veii\\ntook a single leap from littleness to greatness, unlike the gradual\\ngrowth of Rome or Syracuse. At all events, there is the undoubted\\nextent of a great city, a city clearly of an earlier type than Rome, a\\ncity which may well have reached its present extent while Rome had not\\nspread beyond the Palatine. Such a site marks a great advance on the\\noccupation of inaccessible hill-tops; but Veii itself must have seemed\\nan old-world city in the eyes of those who had the highway of the Tiber\\nbelow their walls.\\n\\nIt is strange to step out the traces of a city whose position and\\nextent are so unmistakably marked, but of which nothing is left which\\ncan be called a building, or even a ruin. The most memorable work in\\nthe circuit of Veii is a work not of building but of boring -- the Ponte\\nSodo, hewn in the rock for the better passage of the guardian stream.\\nBesides these, some small fragments of the Etruscan wall, the signs\\nof a double gate, some masonry of the small Roman tower which in after\\ntimes arose within the forsaken walls, are pretty well all that remains\\nof the life of Veii. The remains of its death are more plentiful.\\nThere is the Roman columbarium , within the Etruscan site; there\\nare the Etruscan tombs bored deep in all the surrounding hills. There\\nis, above all, the famous painted tomb, shielding no such sculptures\\nand inscriptions as those on which we gaze in the great Volumnian\\nsepulchre, but within which one lucky eye was privileged for a moment\\nto see the Lucumo himself, as he crumbled away at the entrance of the\\nunaccustomed air. A scrap or two of his harness is there still; the\\narms are there; the strange-shaped beasts are there, in their primitive\\nform and colouring; the guardian lions keep the door; but we have no\\nwritten \\u00e6nigma even to guess at. We can only feel our way to a date by\\nmarking the imperfect attempt at an arch, an earlier and ruder stage\\nby far than the roof of Rome's Tullianum or its fellow at Tusculum.\\nIn the Volumnian tomb the main interest comes from the fact that it\\nbelongs to the very latest Etruscan times, to the transition from\\nEtruscan to Roman life. In the Veientine tomb the main interest comes\\nfrom the fact that it cannot be later than an early stage in Roman\\nhistory, and that it may be as much earlier as we choose to think\\nit. It is the same with all the little that is left of Veii. We know\\nthat, except the palpable remains of the Roman municipium , nothing\\ncan be later than B.C. 396, and that anything may be vastly earlier.\\nIn the history of Italy, the date when Rome doubled her territory by\\nconquering a city a dozen miles from her gates passes for an early\\nstage. The life of Rome is still before her. In Greece at the same\\ndate, the greatness of Athens, the truest greatness of Sparta, is past;\\nthe only fresh life that is to come is that of ephemeral Thebes and\\nhalf-Hellenic Macedonia.\\n\\nWe turn from Veii, feeling how thoroughly true in its main outline, how\\nutterly untrustworthy in its detail, is what passes for early Roman\\nhistory. The legend of Veii counts for less than the legend of Troy,\\ninasmuch as invention and combination are hardly genuine legend at all.\\nBut that Veii was and is not, that her fall was the rising point in\\nRome's destiny, that it was needful for the course of things which has\\nstretched from that day to this that Veii should cease to be -- all this\\nwe understand ten times the better when we turn from the living tale of\\nLivy to the yet more living witness of the forsaken site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiden\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nFrom the villa of the White Hens we looked across to the arx of\\nFiden\\u00e6 as one of the main points in the view. The hill of Castel\\nGiubeleo seems planted there by the hand of nature as a border-defence\\nof Latium against Etruscan attacks. Yet both strong sites and other\\nthings sometimes fail to discharge the exact functions which seem to\\nhave been laid upon them by the hand of nature. The post which seems\\ndesigned as the Latin bulwark against the Etruscan does, as a matter\\nof fact, play its chief part in history in the character of an Etruscan\\noutpost on Latin soil. Whether Fiden\\u00e6 was really such an outpost in the\\nstrict sense, whether it was a remnant of the wider Etruscan dominion\\nof the days when the Tiber was not a border-stream, or whether it was\\na Latin town which, from whatever cause, chose to throw itself on the\\nEtruscan side, it is not only as the enemy of Rome, but as the ally\\nof Veii, that Fiden\\u00e6 made itself memorable. If we accept the received\\nstory, the war which brought about the ruin of Fiden\\u00e6 was caused\\nbecause its people slew the envoys of Rome in obedience to the hasty,\\nperhaps misinterpreted, words of a Veientine king. The king who thus\\ntook so little heed of the law of nations of course paid his forfeit,\\nand the Royal spoils won from Lars Tolumnius by Aulus Cornelius Cossus\\nformed one of the most cherished relics of the early days of Rome. We\\nmay believe the details of the story or not; but the spoils at least\\nwere real, if the witness of Augustus C\\u00e6sar is to be believed.\\n\\nEach of the roads which lead out of Rome -- since the railway came,\\nthere is practically only one way which leads into Rome -- has its own\\nspecial interest, and the Salarian way is certainly not inferior to\\nthe Cassian or the Flaminian. We leave the city by that which in\\nits material fabric is the most modern, which in its associations\\nis perhaps the most historic, of all the gates of Rome. The Salarian\\ngate in the wall of Aurelian may be looked at as in some sort drawing\\nto itself the memories of the neighbouring Colline gate in the wall\\nof Servius. He who fought before the Colline gate, he who entered by\\nthe Colline gate, could hardly fail to march over the ground where in\\nthe new system of defence the Salarian gate was to arise. The Colline\\ngate on the high ground of the Quirinal hill was the weakest point of\\nRome; it was therefore specially strengthened in the Servian line of\\ndefence. It was the point by which most of the early invaders of Rome\\nmarched in or strove to march in. There the revolted troops entered to\\nput down the tyranny of the decemvirs; there the Gauls came in after\\nthe slaughter of the Allia; to that gate Hannibal drew near, and those\\nwho did not understand Hannibal said that he hurled his spear over it.\\nBefore the Colline gate Rome had for the last time to struggle for the\\ndominion of Italy in the fight between Sulla and Pontius Telesinus.\\nAnd when the Colline gate had given way to the Salarian, it was at the\\nnew entrance to Rome that the enemy came in whose coming declared that\\nher political dominion over the world had ceased, but that her moral\\ndominion was stronger than ever. \\\"At midnight the Salarian gate was\\nsilently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous\\nsound of the Gothic trumpet.\\\" And if these gates were a centre of\\nfighting, they were also, in a strange and special way, a centre of\\nburying. Along this road, as along others, we mark the broken tombs\\nhere and there, two pre-eminently just outside the present gate; but\\nthis quarter supplies one strange contrast in the matter of burials\\nwhich is not to be found elsewhere. Outside the Colline gate was the\\nliving tomb of unchaste vestals; not far beyond the Salarian we come\\nto the Christian c\\u0153meterium Priscillae . We go on; we descend the\\nhill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the\\nalluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting\\nof the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might\\nseem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived\\nand gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken\\ndown and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those\\nof Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but\\nif we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must\\nhave been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly\\nnew when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come\\nto another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a medi\\u00e6val\\ntower; the medi\\u00e6val tower now proclaims itself as an \\\"osteria\\\"; but\\nwe feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now\\nfairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills\\nbeyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills\\nof Fiden\\u00e6 are before us. To the right lies the ground between the\\nSalarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his\\nmaster Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the\\nrailway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with\\nTiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between\\nhills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a\\nrange of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to\\nthe right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fiden\\u00e6, in the pass which\\ndivides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on\\nthe inland side.\\n\\nThe arx of Fiden\\u00e6, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,\\na height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer\\nto them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river\\nleaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that\\nside rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city\\ncould look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of\\nthe small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,\\nthe Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii\\nitself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the arx \\nof Fiden\\u00e6 and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.\\nInland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when\\nFiden\\u00e6 was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place\\nagainst the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the\\nrest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original\\n arx . We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its\\n cloaca , the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley\\nby the brook between the lower hill of Fiden\\u00e6 and the hill which lies\\nbetween Fiden\\u00e6 and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It\\nwas no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground\\nas the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand\\nwhy Rome on the first opportunity swept Fiden\\u00e6 utterly away, while the\\nexistence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.\\n\\nAs at Veii, so at Fiden\\u00e6, the traces of the living are gone -- yet more\\nutterly at Fiden\\u00e6 than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more\\nplentiful, though Fiden\\u00e6 has nothing to set against the painted tomb of\\nVeii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won\\nthe spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fiden\\u00e6 as a deserted place,\\nthe possession of a single man. Yet the potestas of Fiden\\u00e6 -- perhaps\\nits dictator -- may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered\\non in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntemn\\u00e6.\\n\\n\\nIt is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography\\nthat its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal\\ncharms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that\\nit has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.\\nThe merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages\\nback. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of\\nall ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are\\nof one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no\\nmonuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it\\nwill be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to\\nthis kind of research. At Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6 the great merit is that\\nthere is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the\\nmore to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fiden\\u00e6\\nuntouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;\\nbut we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.\\nAnd no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 full of Roman\\nand medi\\u00e6val monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,\\nas they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But\\nwe turn from Veii and Fiden\\u00e6 to a city compared with which Veii and\\nFiden\\u00e6 might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,\\nan exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fiden\\u00e6. The\\nsites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside\\nthe sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much\\nnearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it\\ndoes not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,\\neven more truly than at Veii and at Fiden\\u00e6, say that the very ruins\\nhave perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished\\nyet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special\\nattraction of its own.\\n\\nWe took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemn\\u00e6 both from the road to the\\nWhite Hens and from the road to Fiden\\u00e6. As we before said, it ought\\nto be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things\\nare not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh\\nfrom the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the\\nMilvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the\\noldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,\\nto let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that\\nof Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when\\nthe bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic\\nenemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood\\nthe host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius\\nor of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,\\nand how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time\\nwe keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We\\nare therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite\\nanother part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,\\nwho is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.\\nOur present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with\\nBelisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome\\nwas, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We\\nwalk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with\\nthe eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the\\nEtruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,\\nboth come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,\\nthat it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary\\nstream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct\\nand hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie\\nof origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the\\nmost frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor\\nwere sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a\\ndenizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was\\nlike handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path\\nkeeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at\\nall, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a\\nrocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside\\nthe Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters\\nwhen Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.\\nBut, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on\\na site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient\\nsettlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells\\nof any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in\\nthe hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy\\nhill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern\\nside by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemn\\u00e6, a vanished\\ncity whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive\\nwords. Antemn\\u00e6 was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose\\ndaughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers\\ncalled Quenfang , what sociologists called exogamy , which secured\\nthat the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;\\nRome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of\\nnobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemn\\u00e6 is merged, in Rome. We\\nmay be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which\\ngive Antemn\\u00e6 a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to\\nbe that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the\\nsite was, as now, like Fiden\\u00e6, the possession of a single man.\\n\\nThe story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus\\nspares at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.\\nParted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern\\npoint, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at\\nthe very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the\\ndescriptive name Antemnae , the town before the rivers. Such a site\\nbelongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the\\nPalatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was\\nwhile it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive\\nname, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree\\nof progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from\\nthe oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without\\nthe Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like\\nRome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which\\nmust cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be\\nincorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.\\n\\nOf a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that\\nwe can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the\\nsite. Antemn\\u00e6 has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some\\nstones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to\\nbe part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise\\ngreen hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.\\nBut the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates\\nare as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those\\nof Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fiden\\u00e6 and its surroundings, on\\nthe old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge\\nof Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the\\nGaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and\\nsome of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly\\nthe whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's\\n\\\"turriger\\u00e6 Antemn\\u00e6.\\\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the\\ntowers thereof than we were at Veii and Fiden\\u00e6. At Antemn\\u00e6 the ruins\\nthemselves have perished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOstia.\\n\\n\\nFrom the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight\\nremains which mark the sites of Veii and Fiden\\u00e6, from the almost more\\ninstructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemn\\u00e6, we may\\nwell pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any\\nof them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because\\nit was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This\\nis the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an\\nearly stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what\\nRome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making\\nRome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to\\npossess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once\\nmarked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland\\ntowns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and\\nnothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven\\nof Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes\\nOstia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.\\nAnd the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to\\nsupport it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as\\nproving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period\\nwhich is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,\\nperiod. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal\\nAncus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that\\nthe events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep\\nourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition\\nthen calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is\\nthat whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,\\nand that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.\\n\\nThis at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities\\nof that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime\\nenterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.\\nCorinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain\\ncitadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth\\nstarted in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.\\nIt marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies\\nabsolutely in the sea -- Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on\\nher peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland\\nAthens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on\\nthe broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand\\nthe value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or\\nVeii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet\\nmore. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or\\neven Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful\\nfor her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There\\nwere inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no\\ninland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.\\nIndeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime\\nor otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had\\nno separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a\\ndistance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.\\n\\nOstia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is\\neminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of\\nthose fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He\\nhas changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a\\nlittle dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which\\nhave been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,\\nand they have brought to light much that is most interesting and\\ninstructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in\\nvain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon\\nas they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its\\npavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,\\nleads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end\\nis gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to\\nthe stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to\\nimitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his\\nsuccessor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside\\nthe mouth of the cloaca maxima ; make a strong wall of defence against\\nthe waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long\\nas the cloaca maxima itself.\\n\\nAnd what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small\\npart of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia\\nis becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a\\nsomewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first\\nwith the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment\\never happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery\\nof Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at\\nwidely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing\\nwhich is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there\\nor anywhere else -- namely, destruction by the Saracens in the fifth \\ncentury, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \\\"Handbook,\\\" but which was\\ncertainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored\\nby Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as\\nthe haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards\\novercame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for\\nit. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change\\nwhich it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour\\nof Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to\\nlive on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings\\nlater than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with\\ngraceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is\\nabundant evidence that all through the second century of our \\u00e6ra great\\narchitectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there\\nis the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so\\nproudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions\\nsupply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be\\ntoo much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which\\ncertainly suggests that of Arles.\\n\\nIn the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he\\ncomplains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course\\nof the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is\\neminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,\\nsome rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber\\nmakes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,\\nif Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of\\nwalls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,\\namong the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides\\nof a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,\\nbelonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were\\nclearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall\\nwas broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;\\nthey chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best\\nsuited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may\\nwell have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The\\nwall of Servius had ceased to serve any military purpose, and the wall\\nof Aurelian was not yet.\\n\\nThe history of Ostia from the ninth century onwards, from the vain\\nattempt of Gregory the Fourth to turn Ostia into Gregoriopolis ,\\nbelongs to another, though almost adjacent, site. New Ostia, with its\\ncastle, its cathedral, its gateway, its one or two narrow streets, but\\nwith seemingly hardly a dozen inhabitants, is a sadder sight than old\\nOstia, with no inhabitant except the stalwart custode , who defends\\nhimself against Ostian air by daily doses of quinine. Yet the castle\\nof Cardinal Estouteville ranks high among picturesque fortresses; the\\ncathedral shows a mixture of classical and Gothic detail for which\\nnothing in Rome prepares us; fragments of ancient work lie around;\\nthe staircase of the bishop's palace, the palace of the first among\\ncardinals, is rich in ancient inscriptions. But we hasten on to the\\nolder site. There is something specially striking in its half-excavated\\nstate. We tread the ancient pavement, between the ancient houses, of a\\nstreet dug out of a cornfield on either side. The wall of Ancus loses\\nitself in a bank of earth. Here a house, there a temple, is dug out,\\nleaving just space enough to see it among surrounding blades of corn.\\nAt Pompeii, too, the diggings are not finished; but there one part is\\ndug, another is not; here we thread our way along what is dug with the\\nfar greater mass of the undug to right and left of us. So far we are\\ncontent; the undug may soon be promoted to the state of the dug, and\\nMother Earth is a safe keeper of antiquities. It is otherwise with\\nFather Tiber. When he is close on one side of us, there is, as our\\nguide truly tells us, no small danger. He once, as Horace witnesses,\\nset forth to destroy the monuments of Numa at Rome; he is clearly\\nminded to do the like by the monuments of Numa's grandson at Ostia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alban Mount.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the common point of connexion between all the lands and places\\nwhich bear the name of Alba, Albania, or something like it? They lie\\nso far apart, they are inhabited by people of such utterly different\\nnations and languages, that it is strange if there be any point of\\nconnexion among them, while it is at least as strange if the name has\\nsettled down on so many remote spots by sheer accident only. We must\\nnot forget that our own land has an interest in the question: we dwell\\nin the Isle of Albion, and its northern part is specially Albanach or\\nAlbany. An English lady living on the eastern shore of the Hadriatic\\nwas lately complimented by a Scotch lady because, being an Albanian,\\nshe spoke such good English. It was afterwards suggested to her that\\nshe might have answered with a tu quoque or something more; the\\nEnglishwoman was no Albanian; the Scotchwoman in a certain sense was.\\nBut have Albanians of either of these kinds anything to do either with\\nthe Duke of Al v a -- for in his tongue \\\"non aliud est v i v ere quam\\n b i b ere\\\" -- or with the Albania beyond the Euxine? Then again it is\\nsingular to read, say in Dionysios of Halikarnassos, the local wars of\\nRome and Alba Longa described under exactly the same gentile names as\\nthose by which Imperial Anna describes strife between the New Rome and\\nthose Ghegs and Tosks who have again begun to make themselves famous.\\nIt is \\u1fec\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1\\u1fd6\\u03bf\\u03b9 and \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af in both cases, without the change of jot or\\ntittle. In this case, at least, we believe that philologers would deny\\nthe slightest kindred between the names; but the casual identity is\\nthereby only made the more startling. A malicious critic might say\\nthat Anna's Romans were as unlike old Romans as her Albanians could be\\nunlike the men of Alba Longa. But her Romans did at least claim to be\\nRomans, sharers in the inheritance of the wolf and the eagle; while\\nher Albanians certainly laid no claims to any rights in the Alban sow\\nand her thirty pigs.\\n\\nRome, undutiful daughter, swept away her mother city so thoroughly\\nthat its site has become a matter of dispute. But the name lived on in\\nderivative forms. Alba perished, but the Alban lake and the Alban mount\\nkept their places, to play no small part in the history of Rome. There\\nis the lake, there is the great drain for its waters, so strangely\\ninterwoven with the tale of Veii. There is the mount, with the road\\nby which the chariot of Marcellus went up in triumph; there are still\\nthe displaced stones of the temple which was the religious centre\\nof the Latin name. But for the fanaticism of the last Stewart, the\\npillared front of the Latin Jupiter might still form the proudest of\\ncrowns for the height on which the gazer from the walls of Rome fixes\\nhis eye more commonly than on any other. And, if Alba perished, she\\ndid in a manner rise again. The neighbourhood of dead Alba became as\\nfavourite a quarter for the villas of Roman nobles as the neighbourhood\\nof living Tusculum. There the great Pompeius had a dwelling; there,\\naccording to one version of his story, his body -- or perhaps only his\\nhead -- found a stately tomb, though Hadrian could make his verse by the\\nAlexandrian Shore to say that no tomb had been found for him who had\\nso many temples. But of all villas on Alban ground, of all Albana ,\\nthe Albanum of the Emperors, with its spacious gardens, its long\\nterraces still to be traced, of course came to be the greatest. The\\nwalled station of the Imperial guards, the fellow of the Pr\\u00e6torian\\ncamp at Rome, became the kernel of a new town, and Albano still\\nexists, an episcopal city, seat of a cardinal-bishop, and it still\\nkeeps its character as a summer retreat for those who, now as of old,\\nseek to escape the smoke and wealth and noise of lordly Rome. Albano\\nand Alba stand in somewhat the same relation as Spalato and Salona.\\nIn both cases the new city grew out of an Imperial dwelling-place in\\nthe neighborhood of the old. But there is this wide difference between\\nthem, that Alba has utterly perished, while Salona survives in ample\\nruins. Alba had vanished ages and ages before Albano arose. Spalato\\nstood ready to be a city of refuge for those who fled from Salona in\\nher day of overthrow.\\n\\nThe town of Albano itself contains a good many antiquities, the most\\nprominent among which, that which greets the eye on the entrance from\\nRome, is the huge tower-like pile, so cruelly stripped of its hewn\\nstone, which, truly or falsely, passes for the tomb of Cn\\u00e6us Pompeius\\nMagnus. More striking on a close examination, though spoiled in its\\neffect by a Papal freak of restoration, is the tomb which hovers\\nbetween the names of Aruns son of Porsena and the Horatii and Curiatii.\\nWhich of the two would Sir George Lewis have looked on as the more\\nimpossible? This is the tomb which so singularly forestalled the\\noutline of the Glastonbury kitchen -- before its chimneys perished -- and\\nthereby of the Museum laboratory at Oxford. A good deal of the wall of\\nthe camp, a good deal of an amphitheatre on the hill-side, and several\\nother fragments of the earlier Imperial time, are still to be seen.\\nBut after all Albano really exists, not for its own sake, but as a\\nstarting-point for the Alban lake and the Alban mount, and hardly less\\nas a starting-point for\\n\\n ... the still glassy lake that sleeps\\n Beneath Aricia's trees.\\n\\nAricia has changed its site; the small modern town has flown up to\\nthe level of the arx , to be approached by Albano by almost the only\\nwork on which we do not grudge to see the name of Pius IX. The viaduct\\nof that \\\"Pontifex Optimus Maximus\\\" -- his votaries seem never quite to\\ndistinguish between him and Jupiter -- is really a work worthy of C\\u00e6sars\\nor consuls. Below it new Aricia has left the elder city, its fragments\\nof walls and of the Appian Way, to be sought for in the valley below,\\nthe crater, so wise men tell us, of an extinct volcano, the biggest\\nsurely even in this region where craters meet us at every step. Scraps\\nof prim\\u00e6val wall, hardly to be distinguished from the rocks, prepare\\nus for what we are to see at places further out of the ordinary track;\\nwalls of the days of Sulla join on alike to what we have seen at Rome,\\nand to what we are to see at Cori. But, after all, the \\\"still glassy\\nlake\\\" to which the grove of the \\\"rex nemorensis\\\" has given the name of\\nNemi, is the true glory of Aricia. How well we remember being puzzled\\nyears and years ago with the thrilling run of the lines -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nIn these days the fault would be held to lie with the poet for\\nventuring on an allusion which it might need a little research to take\\nin. In those days we thought in such cases that the fault lay with\\nourselves; we admired without understanding till we lighted on the\\nexplanation which enabled us to understand as well. As such a process\\nis a wholesome one, we will leave the lines without comment; not to\\nspeak of books of reference, the story will be found, in a somewhat\\ngrotesque form, in Dr. Merivale's chapter on the reign of Caius, better\\nknown as Caligula.\\n\\nThe ghastly priest has gone from Nemi; but the lake is there still,\\nand the successors of the trees. Access is courteously granted by\\nthe present owner, who, we may believe, has never slain anybody, and\\nwho, we hope, may not be slain himself. But though we may admire Nemi\\nfrom close by, we do not fully understand Nemi and its place among\\nthings, till we can look upon it in company with its greater fellow\\nof Alba. That is, we must climb the Alban mount, or a good part of\\nits height. But we go first to the Alban lake itself; and to do so\\nwe go along its rim and slide down the side of its crater. There we\\nfind the emissarius , so deftly cut in the rock, and which has done\\nits work so well for so many ages. Who made it? Camillus, or some\\none long before Camillus? The men who built the great cloaca of\\nRome were quite capable of cutting the hole through the rock of Alba,\\nwithout any message from Delphi or any design against the walls of\\nVeii. Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than\\nClaudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it\\nhas been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,\\nwe may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only\\nto keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp\\ntill we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy\\nof the name crater . We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side\\nby side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some\\ntime which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to\\nsay that it was long before the oldest prim\\u00e6val wall, the powers of\\nwater supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with\\nits narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable\\nto be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily\\ncome to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,\\ntaken to check it.\\n\\nBut when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house\\nwhich the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by\\nthe rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called\\nfields of Hannibal -- yet another crater, science tells us -- when we have\\nclimbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed\\nunderstand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than\\nwe did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over\\nthe battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Pr\\u00e6neste; it\\nmay range hither and thither over many points which have their charm\\nboth of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the\\nhistorical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will\\nbetter take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven\\nhills shrunk out of sight, a point -- rather a line -- in the Latin plain,\\nwith a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different\\nwas the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see\\nhow she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we\\nsee how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;\\nand we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look\\ndown too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the\\nvanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great\\nflat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.\\nHere, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where\\n\\n ... the Witch's Fortress\\n O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.\\n\\nAnd beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more\\ndistant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as\\na height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name\\nof Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,\\nnot only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights\\naround it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we\\nfeel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of\\nwide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a\\npower seated at Veii or at Pr\\u00e6neste. Rome, on her great river, with\\nher haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or\\nallies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the\\ngreat powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread\\nEtruscan pirates and Ph\\u0153nician traders; the Greek of Cum\\u00e6 might\\nperhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.\\nWe may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the\\nfall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that\\nare left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was\\nthat Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the\\ncamping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we\\nbelieve in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how\\nthings had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the\\nCarthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into\\nItaly by land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCori.\\n\\n\\nThere was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the\\nAcademy a little time back, that there must be something \\\"irritating to\\nthe Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often\\nadopted by English writers towards Italian history.\\\" \\\"Their cities,\\\"\\nhe said, \\\"which are still instinct with political and social life, are\\nregarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque\\nreminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\\\" Mr. Creighton was\\nspeaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he\\nsays may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where\\nthe political and social life at least hides itself from the passing\\ntourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as\\nnothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the\\ncity seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;\\nit is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after soldi \\nwhich nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid\\nof; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying\\nwhich the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree\\nmore advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less\\nfar back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once\\nindependent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,\\nand, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they\\nwere, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are\\nnow, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than\\ntheir successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty\\nof the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants -- far\\nkeener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the\\ncity awakens in his mind -- really does him no harm. The modern Latins\\nor Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of\\nthe country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the\\ncuriosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the\\nPrisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave\\nand discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when\\nhe knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is\\nsomething grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the\\nsight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the\\ncentre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;\\nnot exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not\\nill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.\\n\\nSomething of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at\\nleast, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right\\nwing of the Latin host of Regillus:\\n\\n Aricia, Cora, Norba,\\n Velitr\\u00e6, with the might\\n Of Setia and of Tusculum.\\n\\nTusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate\\npilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban\\nmount; \\\"Setia's purple vineyards\\\" it may be hard to take into the line\\nof march; but, with a slight change of order, \\\"Velitr\\u00e6, Cora, Norba,\\\"\\nwith the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,\\nwill form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have\\nmade it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that\\nthey have not cut into two. Velitr\\u00e6 -- hardly changed in the modern\\nVelletri -- has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest\\nbell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps\\nin, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps\\nout the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;\\nit stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter\\nneighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the\\necclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral\\nchurch placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom\\nof the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern\\npalaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman\\nremains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of medi\\u00e6val times. The\\nchief value of the town is as a starting-point -- we can hardly call it\\ncentre -- for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The\\nview from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,\\ndying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the\\nmighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all\\nthe height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its\\nfollowing of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like\\na great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean\\nDown and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes\\ntowards them by something more than their bright masses, something more\\nthan a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points\\nare crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned\\nstands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far\\nlower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some\\nway down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when\\nthe sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for\\nwhich Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for -- \\n\\n ... the gigantic watch-towers,\\n No work of earthly men,\\n Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook\\n The never-ending fen.\\n\\nWatch-towers, perhaps, in the strictest sense, we do not see, and we\\nshall hardly find them when we come nearer; but Cora, Cori , still\\nkeeps the mightiest of walls, which it was no wonder that men looked\\non as too mighty to be the work of such mortals -- in Homer's phrase -- as\\nwe now are, and looked on them as reared by no hands weaker than those\\nof the forgers of Jove's own thunderbolts. With Cori we enter on the\\nexamination of a long series of towns, whose main feature is their\\nprim\\u00e6val walls, and among these Cori has the merit of showing us the\\nwalls that are the most prim\\u00e6val of all. None of its fellows can show\\nsuch blocks as the mysterious engineers, whose work men love to call\\nCyclopean, piled together in the lower town of Cori, just outside\\nwhat is now the gate of Ninfa. Blocks indeed of equal size we may see\\nelsewhere, but surely none of equal rudeness. They are heaped together\\nas they were hewn or torn away from their place in the natural rock;\\nhuge limestone blocks of every size and shape, with the spaces between\\nthem filled up with similar stones of their own kind. But the whole\\nrange of the wall of Cori is not of this primitive sort. The curious\\nin such matters distinguish five epochs: Cyclopean, Latin, Old Roman,\\nRoman of Sulla's day, and -- the leap is a great one -- medi\\u00e6val walls\\nof the time of King Ladislaus; we hardly venture to give an Angevin\\nking of the hither Sicily the full Slavonic shape which marks him\\nas sprung from the other side of Hadria. The stones of the first\\nfour -- we have already spoken of the first of all -- are all polygonal,\\nof distinguishing degrees of regularity of work and degrees of size.\\nThe rudest wall, as far as we saw, of all is to be found quite at the\\nbottom; the others may be seen side by side in the great walls of the\\n arx which soar high above all, and which shelter the chief ornament\\nof Cori in quite another department.\\n\\nAccording to the nearly invariable rule, the arx of Cora contained\\na temple, and the temple, as so often happens, has been turned into\\na church. But the change has been less destructive to Cori than in\\nmany other places. The house of St. Peter has been built without\\ndamaging the portico of the house of Hercules -- the old Latin Herculus\\nwas hopelessly confused with the H\\u00earakl\\u00eas of Greek legend -- and still\\nkeeps the columns of his portico, both on its front and its sides;\\nkeeps his entablature, his pediment, the gate-way of his cella , the\\ninscription which records the work of the local duumvirs , Manlius\\nand Turpilius. But what shall we say to the columns themselves? They\\nprofess to be Doric, even to be Greek Doric; but they have bases; they\\nstand as wide apart as Etruscan tradition planted the columns of the\\nCapitoline Jupiter; the shafts themselves, instead of being as massive\\nas P\\u00e6stum, are slenderer than Nemea. But sin against rule as it may,\\nthe upper temple at Cori is still undoubtedly pretty, to say the least,\\nand it is really all the more interesting because of its sin against\\nrule. Far finer in themselves are the Corinthian columns -- such as are\\nleft -- of the temple of the Greek Twin Brethren lower down the hill;\\nbut we can see good Corinthian columns in a great many places; the\\npeculiarities of the Hercules temple are special to Cori. Do they not\\nspeak of the Hellenizing mind of the great dictator who made Cora rise\\nagain after it had suffered deeply at the hands of his Marian enemies?\\nStern restorer of what he deemed Rome's ancient ways, but votary and\\nfavourite of Hellenic gods, the taste of Sulla might well lead him to\\nsome such forms as we see in the object, yet prominent from many points\\nof view, that crowns the height of the citadel of Cora.\\n\\nBut we have not gone through the full tale of the antiquities of\\nthis strange little mountain-city. Outside the Ninfa gate, spanning\\nat a vast height the deep gorge which on that side forms the foss\\nof Cori, rises a bridge, of days which we call ancient, but which we\\nare tempted to call modern so near to the Cyclopean wall. Not a few\\nfragments of columns may be marked here and there in the streets. We\\nlight too on inscriptions. Besides the duumvirs -- one might call them\\nthe bailiffs -- of the Roman Municipium, whose names are carved on the\\nfrieze of Hercules, another commemorates two Praitors ; surely these,\\nwith their archaic spelling, are the abiding magistrates of the Latin\\nCommonwealth -- as Cicero's Milo was dictator of Lanuvium -- dependent on\\nRome, but not fully incorporated in her substance. Then, besides the\\nchief temple, other Pagan buildings and objects have been turned to\\nChristian uses. In the church where St. Peter has supplanted Hercules,\\nan altar, if altar it be, bearing rams with horns and the Gorgon's\\nhead, has been hollowed out to make a baptismal font. The church of St.\\nOliva bears a dedication dating only from the sixteenth century; but it\\nis a lovely cloister of that better kind of Renaissance which was in\\ntruth only a falling back on Romanesque. In the church are memorials\\nof earlier times, classical columns used again, fitted some of them\\nwith capitals of the very rudest Romanesque, whose fellows may be\\nfound in Worcester and at Hildesheim. Altogether Cori is emphatically a\\nplace for a visit. But a word of warning must be given. Cori and Norba\\ncannot be combined so as to see both worthily in a single day. Let the\\ntraveller either make two distinct outings from Velletri, or let him\\ntake his chance of sleeping at Cori; it may not be a worse chance than\\nsleeping at Frosinone, where sleep may be had. Then let him rise up\\nearly in the morning and saddle his ass, or, if able-bodied, let him\\nrather make his way on his own feet along the mountain-path to Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorba.\\n\\n\\nWe will suppose that, the mutual curiosity of natives and strangers\\nhaving been fully gratified at Cori, the strangers have set out on\\ntheir way, on mule-back or otherwise. The mountain-track up and down,\\nskirting the lower heights of the Volscian range, opens noble views\\nof the higher mountains inland, of the wide flat below, and of the sea\\nbeyond. But these views are perhaps, on the whole, better enjoyed when\\nthe traveller has found a firm foothold within \\\"Norba's ancient wall\\\"\\nthan while he has personal experience how\\n\\n The patient ass, up flinty paths,\\n Plods with his weary load.\\n\\nStill worse indeed is it when the flinty paths have to be plodded\\ndown, and when the weary load needs all his theoretical philosophy\\nto persuade him how thoroughly safe he really is, while the weakness\\nof the flesh surrounds the descent with terrors which he knows to\\nbe unreal. At last the ancient wall rises immediately before him;\\nthe hill-side, a small height straight above the path, is climbed on\\nhis own feet, and he can presently contemplate at his ease both the\\nwall itself and the prospect which it commands. The last part of the\\nass-track has become so like a lane anywhere else that we are amazed\\nwhen we reach the other side of the immediate height of Norba, and find\\nhow far below lies the plain from which the almost perpendicular cliffs\\nspring to bear up the forsaken city. For at Norba the curiosity will\\nbe almost wholly on the side of the stranger; in cannot be returned in\\nkind, as at Cori; a lone shepherd or two may come to look at him; he\\ncannot bring together the least approach to a triumphal procession.\\nFor within the wall all is, we cannot say desolate or forsaken, for\\nthe crops are there, full and green -- \\\" segetes, ubi Norba fuit \\\" -- but\\nthe ancient circuit is at least empty of all dwelling-places of man.\\nWe would fain believe that the space has stood as empty as it now\\ndoes ever since the people of Norba -- less wise, as the event showed,\\nthan their neighbours of Cora -- embraced the cause of Marius with such\\ndesperate zeal that they slew themselves and burned their houses rather\\nthan let either themselves or their goods fall into the hands of Sulla.\\nThis inference might possibly be rash; for the ancient wall fences in\\nat least one ruin which may be later than the days of the fortunate\\ndictator. But it is clear that Norba, if it recovered from this great\\nsingle blow, gradually dwindled away, to the profit, first of Norma\\nby its side, which still abides, and of Ninfa, at its foot, which has\\nperished only less utterly than Norba itself.\\n\\nCori and Norba are alike cities set on hills, and neither of them has\\nany fear of being hid. But they are set on hills in different senses.\\nCori occupies the upper part of the sloping hill, and the houses spread\\ndown the slope. Norba occupies a large table-land on the edge of the\\nmountains, and its outer wall is carried along the upper rim of a\\nsteep and lofty cliff. No dwellings could ever have spread themselves\\ndownwards on the side which looks toward the marshes and the sea.\\nBut we should hardly have said the outer wall; for the height was so\\ncarefully fortified that outlying defences were placed at various\\npoints on the side of the cliff wherever the primitive engineers\\ndeemed such defences needful. Within the circuit, again, the arx \\nrose on several terraces; its highest point -- crowned, we may believe,\\nas usual, by a temple -- must have formed a proud object indeed from the\\nvast extent of land and sea which it looks down upon. No other of its\\nancient neighbours looks down so immediately on the great Pomptine\\nflat as Norba does, as none looks down from so great a height. Cori\\nrather occupies a hill thrown out in front of the mountain; Norba sits\\non the edge of the mountain itself, though of course at a much lower\\nelevation than the huge masses further inland. The towers and temples\\nof the city must have had a wonderful effect from the lands below; as\\nit is, there is nothing to mark the place but the line of wall itself,\\nwhich does not always stand out in a very marked way from the cliff.\\nIt is then perhaps in some sort well that the later Norma has taken\\nthe place of Norba. On the hill of Norba we see that Norma and Norba\\nby no means join one another; there is a gap between them which, while\\nwe are on the mountain, might pass for a valley. But as we look from\\nbelow, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,\\nand Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like\\na continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,\\nperhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within\\nwhich the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can\\ntake in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of\\nSermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the\\nwhole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points\\nwith which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from\\nthe height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and\\nnew proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable\\nmembers of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front\\nof the Circ\\u00e6an height -- a height so nearly cut off from the mainland\\nthat it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we\\nbetter understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days\\nwhen they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked\\nin what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of\\nmolehills by the yellow Tiber.\\n\\nAs the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by\\nthe walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill\\nstands distinct, the arx alone crowns the top, and where the town\\nwalls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts\\nitself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass\\nof the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the\\nrudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they\\nhave a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,\\nand it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone\\nhas been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of\\nthe weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the\\nfiner stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth\\ntheir while, do something more than this. They could, when they had\\nto make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of\\nexactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded\\noff, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at\\nthe greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign\\nof either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it\\nwould almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the\\nopening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung\\nbetween two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the\\nfirst builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which\\nmen began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great\\ninvention, is shown by a ruined building -- one of the few things within\\nthe wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building -- a little\\nway beyond the arx . Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for\\nthe roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea and New Grange,\\nnor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and\\nthe attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well\\nas from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,\\nmost unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call\\nthem, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange\\nproblem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have\\nalready hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,\\nlike that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as\\nwell come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.\\n\\nFrom prim\\u00e6val and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning\\nas we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only\\nmedi\\u00e6val, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is\\na house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least\\njust outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual\\ndwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have\\nonce been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which\\nstrikes us between the stern prim\\u00e6val wall of Norba, fencing in the\\nthick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied\\nand picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and\\nbuildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till\\na thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,\\nroofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of\\nruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of\\na dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played\\nits part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested\\nby its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to\\ndo with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed\\nelection. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,\\nled to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to\\nbe reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak\\nmight restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder\\nmen living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa\\nwithout greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is\\nsomething specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,\\nstanding so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look\\nof things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of\\nthe ruined medi\\u00e6val sites which often meet us in this region. It is\\nnot merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something\\nIrish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both\\nat Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in\\nIreland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,\\nthere is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might\\nhave been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of\\nthe houses reaching even into Renaissance times. The church of most\\npretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses\\nand the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness\\nof ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a\\ntown, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa\\nhas little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As\\nfor the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on\\nthe hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an\\nunrecorded age piled together to make Norba.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSegni.\\n\\n\\nThe visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history\\non the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite\\ncertain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take\\nwith him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there\\nmay be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a\\nhidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that\\nclass, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes\\nnothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they\\ndo not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A\\nnatural and important question is sure to present itself, and -- without\\nwings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome -- there is no immediate\\nmeans of answering it. Is the name of Signia -- now by a very slight\\nchange Segni -- to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of\\nLatium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry\\nthem all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in\\nwhich Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every\\nstep that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully\\nadmire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out\\nin each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his\\nquotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still\\nMacaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,\\nif he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian\\nand Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the\\nfact that \\\"Ferentinum of the rock,\\\" yet further on, has its place in\\nthem alongside of \\\"Gabia of the pool.\\\" He turns to his guide-book -- and\\nthe guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,\\nis almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only\\nthe entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with\\nthe remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.\\nAnd again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in\\nthe later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part -- Were the\\npeople of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic\\npavements? There is a kind of work called opus Signinum , a pattern\\nof black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at\\nPompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an\\nexample a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting\\nas the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin\\nLeague. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which\\nit will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had\\nat Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself\\na little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the\\nplace where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to\\nthe great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he\\nmay for the moment comfort himself by thinking that there are those who\\nmight be unkind enough to hint that he would still be equally uncertain\\nif he had a hundred quotations on the tip of his tongue, or if he were\\nin a library with thousands of volumes to turn to.\\n\\nBut whether Signia was ever a Thirty-city or not -- we may be\\nallowed to follow the local usage of Canterbury, which speaks of \\\"a\\nSix-preacher\\\" -- there is no doubt as to its geographical position;\\nthere is no doubt as to the grandeur of its remains. In starting from\\nVelletri, with Algidus and its holm-oaks and its memories of \\u00c6quian\\nencampments on our left hand, on the right we turn the corner of the\\nVolscian mountains, and the railway carries us along the valley between\\nthem and their Hernican rivals. We reach the station of Segni; we mark\\nmore than one town perched on the opposite heights; we have close by\\nus, in the low ground -- reminding us of Ninfa on a smaller scale -- the\\nwalls of a forsaken fortress, with a shattered tower of wonderful\\nheight and slenderness; but the walls of Signia still keep themselves\\nhidden among the mountains. It is not from the side of Velletri, but,\\nas we afterwards learn, from the side of Anagni, that Segni on its\\nmountain height, and its satellite of Gavignano, perched on a smaller\\ndetached hill in front, form striking features in the landscape.\\n\\nSegni belongs to the same class of hill-fortress as Norba, not the\\nsame class as Cori. It occupies, not the top of a conical hill, but\\na table-land, if we may apply that name to so narrow a space, on\\nthe mountain itself. The distinction is well marked by comparing it\\nwith Gavignano just below, which is one of the chief objects in the\\nimmediate view from the height of Segni. The difference is just the\\nsame as the difference between Norba and Sermoneta, though Gavignano\\nhas more the air of being an outpost of Segni than Sermoneta has of\\nbeing an outpost of Norba. The hill-top which Segni crowns is long\\nand narrow, at some points very narrow indeed, so as to give to the\\nspace within the walls nearly the shape of a figure of eight. The\\nspace within is neither wholly forsaken, as at Norba, nor all crowded\\nwith dwellings, as at Cori. The modern town has withdrawn into one\\nquarter of the old enclosure; but it has not, as in so many other\\ncases, withdrawn into the ancient citadel. The site of the arx of\\nSignia, rising but little above the general level of the hill-top,\\nbut placed well so as to command what we may call the isthmus between\\nthe two parts of the town, forms no part of the dwelling-place of\\nthe modern Signians; but under the name of Passegiata it does form\\npart of their pleasure-ground. The modern town has retreated into the\\nother loop of the figure of eight, that which lies furthest from the\\ntraveller as he draws near from Velletri, but to which the course of\\nthe road will necessarily take him first. He may enter by a gateway\\nof Roman date, and if he so does his eye will soon be struck by the\\ngreat number of graceful fragments of medi\\u00e6val work to be found within\\nthe narrow streets of Segni. The town has most likely been for ages\\ntoo poor to follow the example of its richer neighbours in replacing\\nbeauty by ugliness. But he will do better to keep for a while from\\nentering the inhabited part of the town. Let him first make the circuit\\nof the ancient walls. And he can hardly doubt whether to turn to the\\nright hand or to the left. The claims of the left are in this case\\noverwhelming. Long before he has reached the town, he must have seen\\nfar away on the hill the most precious of the remains of Signia, the\\ngateway which stands, forsaken but still untouched, beckoning him, as\\nit were, to make his way first of all to the most instructive thing\\nwhich the prim\\u00e6val city has to show him.\\n\\nBut before he can reach either the Roman or the prim\\u00e6val gate he will\\nhave begun to notice the character of the wall. The construction is\\nhardly so rude as the rudest parts of the wall at Cori, but a great\\ndeal of it belongs to the same general stage of engineering progress.\\nThe huge polygonal stones are heaped together; but one might note\\nperhaps two stages, yet often intermingled -- one, where the sides only \\nof the stones are cut so as to fit their neighbours; another, where\\nthe outer faces are also smoothed of what is called \\\"rustication\\\" in\\nlate Renaissance work. In the first they are not left so utterly in a\\nstate of nature as they are at Cori. Their sides have been cut to the\\nshape which was thought best for the work of piling them together. In\\na later stage, also seen at Cori, the outer sides, those which stand\\nfree from the scarped wall, are also cut; but it is not always easy\\nto say how much of the change of the surface is due to art and how\\nmuch to weather. At Segni the peculiar shape of the enclosure makes it\\nsomewhat hard to follow the line of the walls without a ground-plan,\\nand a ground-plan is not to be had at Segni merely by asking for it.\\nBut it is plain that, in many parts at least, on the whole side of\\nthe hill which lies exposed to the open valley, and on the head of the\\nwhole promontory, there was, whenever the ground allowed and required\\nit, a double wall, one on the edge of the hill, the other at some\\ndistance down its side. The most famous of the gates of Segni, locally\\nknown as Porta Saracenesca , leads from the outside world into the\\nouter enclosure, at a point well chosen for military purposes, close\\nto the edge, and commanding the path by which the traveller will most\\nlikely make his way to it. And a mighty gate it is, and one that holds\\nno small place in the history of the art of construction. It is one of\\nthose instances which show that their builders were still ignorant of\\nthe principle of the arch, but that they were, so to speak, in search\\nof it. They had not yet learned how to make the top of an opening out\\nof stones really so arranged as to stand by mutual support; but they\\nwere striving after something beyond the mere horizontal lintel resting\\non two vertical supports. The builders of Segni had not got so far as\\nthose of Veii or Tusculum; as they had no idea of the true principle\\nof the arch, so they had no idea of its form; all they could do was\\nto place two horizontal stones with sides sloping inwards immediately\\nunder the lintel. In truth, the construction is still purely that of\\nthe lintel, and nothing else; but the form chosen shows a certain\\nvain striving after something different. As such, it is no small\\nlesson which it teaches; and the effect of the great stones thus piled\\ntogether to form the entrance is striking and solemn. It carries us\\nback from days which on our side of the Alps we deem ancient, but when\\nthe arts of construction were as well known as they are now, to days\\nwhen men were making the first rude attempts towards the greatest of\\nconstructive inventions. Attempts of this kind, simply because they are\\nmere attempts, failures and not successes, have a more ancient look\\nthan those examples where the builders were fully satisfied with the\\nlintel construction and attempted no other. In point of fact, whatever\\ntheir relative date, they are later in idea, as showing a desire to\\ninnovate on the received form, some instances of which were at last\\ncrowned with success.\\n\\nIt is not easy to see how this gate came by its local name. One can\\nunderstand the process of thought by which the roofing at Tusculum,\\nwhich has the outward shape of the pointed arch, came to be called\\n arco Gotico ; it is harder to guess why the great prim\\u00e6val gate of\\nSegni should be attributed to Saracens. It is far from being the only\\nprim\\u00e6val gateway in the whole circuit. No less than five have been\\ncounted between the outer and inner walls, and two more in the part of\\nthe enclosure occupied by the modern town, where the two lines of wall\\ncoincide. Hard by Porta Saracenesca itself is a small sally-port;\\nof the others, the larger ones, like Porta Saracenesca itself,\\nstand at right angles to the wall. Some of them at least show the same\\nstrivings after the arch as their greater neighbour. The nature of the\\nground forbids the arx from reaching any great height above the rest\\nof the city; but its place is easily marked. It contains a singular\\nlarge cistern of Roman work, and close by is one of those junctions\\nof different ages which always preach to us a living historic lesson.\\nHere is the terrace of a temple wrought with stones of the primitive\\nconstruction. On this primitive work rise the remains of the cella in\\nRoman masonry, and the Roman wall of the cella is now carried up to\\nform a church. Now, at least the church is of no architectural value,\\nbut it is none the less a witness to the greatest of all the changes\\nwhich the hoary walls of Signia have looked upon.\\n\\nLanded, then, in Christian Segni, we may, perhaps, remember that one of\\nthe greatest of the Popes was born either in the town itself or in its\\nsatellite of Gavignano. But which was the actual spot? Our one guide\\navailable at the moment seems to doubt between the two. In either case\\nwe see, if we do not tread, the place which gave birth to the third\\nand greatest of the Innocents. We find, too, that a Papal palace of\\nSegni was swept away by the Duke of Alva in that strange war which the\\nCatholic King Philip waged, not, of course, against the Vicar of St.\\nPeter, but against the temporal Sovereign of the Roman States.\\n\\nWe are thus, even at Segni, plunged among Papal memories; we look over\\nthe valley of the Trerus across to Anagni, and they press upon us with\\ndouble force. We hasten to the spot where a lesser Pope than Innocent,\\nbut still a mighty one, died like a dog after his fox-like entrance and\\nhis lion-like reign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIter ad Brundisium.\\n\\nI. Anagni.\\n\\n\\nHe who goes steadily from Rome to Brindisi, seeing what comes in his\\nway by the easiest manner of going, will not come very much oftener\\non the track of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is\\nthe haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he\\ncan along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will\\nof necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from\\nRome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.\\nBut the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and\\nits lesser fellow -- the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and\\ndry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child\\nAlbano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the\\ntemple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left -- all\\nthese seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So\\nmay the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre, -- the\\nhill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \\\"Norba's ancient wall,\\\" with\\nneither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it -- Ninfa's more modern\\nwall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,\\nruined churches, in abundance -- all these may be connected with an\\n iter ad Brundisium , but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let\\nour traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway -- we were\\ngoing to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could\\nwell be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his\\ntime-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni\\nand go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.\\nNot that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the\\ngates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It\\nwould most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,\\nprince of guidebook-makers, recommends the locanda there as \\\"reinlich\\nund eidlich,\\\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller\\nwill be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more\\ninclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is\\nno doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,\\nAnagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is\\nthe first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is\\nnot unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make\\nAnagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest\\nfor the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome\\nbut from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points\\nin some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he\\nwill be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,\\nalmost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is\\nas the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met\\nhis end, the prisoner -- not the last Pope who was fated so to be -- of\\na French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the\\nmind. In medi\\u00e6val history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to\\nthis day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress\\nmeaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.\\nAnagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore\\ndid not suffer at the hands of Renaissance Popes as Rome lived to\\nsuffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well\\ngo back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,\\nthen Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome\\nwhich neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and\\nPyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in\\nwhich Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation\\nof the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is\\nharder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading\\nOld-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few\\npersonal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or\\nOld-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical\\nor legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,\\nand the one great event in their political history; and those tell us\\na great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom\\nSpurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great\\nTriple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having\\nneither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,\\nthey hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.\\nBut their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust\\nin as they were between \\u00c6quians and Volscians, no alliance could\\nbe more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most\\nexposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself\\nwas the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle\\nmust have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must\\nhave looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants\\nof the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have\\nendured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening\\nneighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to\\nanother, we better understand the political relations of the endless\\nlittle communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The\\nally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need\\nto climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack\\nor deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them\\ntherefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare\\nand without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but\\nthey were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's\\nsight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at\\nAnagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either\\nat Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If\\nin some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less\\nclearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as\\nits symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one\\nanother could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.\\nThey must be always doing something to one another in the way either\\nof friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when\\nSpurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the\\nfirst Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land\\nand its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed\\nput a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.\\n\\nWe come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded\\nin by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni\\nand Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an\\nisolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,\\nthe city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the\\nhill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the\\nmiddle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief\\nstreet between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the\\nhill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,\\nthan can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,\\nallowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,\\nand a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must\\nconfess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well\\ntheir bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works\\nof the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the\\ndifference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious\\nforms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring\\nus back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by\\nordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord\\nMacaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there\\nwould have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \\\"no work of\\nearthly men,\\\" or as -- \\n\\n Reared by the hands of giants\\n For godlike kings of old.\\n\\nThe walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome\\nare wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to\\nput together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it\\nwas to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who\\nthoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use\\nit with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,\\nround the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they\\nare broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others\\nmerely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone\\nthrough all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the\\ncourse of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a\\nwhole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a\\ngood deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to\\ntheir nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.\\nIn some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by\\nfurther defences, buttresses rather than towers -- defences, by-the-way,\\nwhich must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later\\ntimes. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,\\ngreater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and\\nalways laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of\\nlarger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones\\nof two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a\\nlight-coloured stone exactly like the puff-stone of Gloucestershire,\\nthe material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings\\nin that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark\\nvolcanic peperino , which, towards the south-eastern part of the wall,\\nis used much more freely. The general effect, wherever the wall is at\\nall perfect, is stately and striking in the extreme, both in form and\\ncolour.\\n\\nNow was it only a dream when we tracked out these walls, and took a\\ncertain pleasure in speaking of them as Hernican walls? We come back\\nto our library; we take down the Dictionary of Geography ; we turn to\\nthe article \\\"Anagnia,\\\" and we find that by far the best contributor to\\nthe series, Mr. E. H. Bunbury, has another tale to tell. Our feelings\\nare damped when he says, \\\"The only remains extant there are of Roman\\ndate and of little interest.\\\" As to the \\\"little interest,\\\" we venture\\nto have our own opinion in any case; we should hold that so great\\nan extent of ancient wall still bounding an inhabited town was an\\nobject of high interest, even if it could be shown to belong to the\\nlatest days which could come under the definition of \\\"Roman date.\\\"\\nBut what is Roman date? Mr. Bunbury sends us to the correspondence of\\nthe Emperor Marcus with Cornelius Fronto. We hope he does not ask us\\nto believe that the walls are later than the days of the philosophic\\nEmperor. For, if he will allow them to be as old as that, we can call\\nthe Emperor himself to witness that they must be a good deal older. For\\nMarcus himself read an inscription over one of the gates, \\\" Flamen sume\\nsamentum .\\\" He did not know what \\\" samentum \\\" meant, and we cannot find\\nthe word in our Latin dictionary. But a native explained to him its\\nmeaning in the Hernican language; it meant the skin of the victim which\\nthe flamen put on his head when he entered the town. We do not want\\nto be unreasonable in our dates, if only we can let in our Hernicans\\nat some corner. When we looked at the walls, we saw at once that they\\nhad no fellowship with the prim\\u00e6val works at Cori and at Segni; they\\ndid seem to us to have fellowship with the works of the Tarquins at\\nRome. We shall be quite happy if Mr. Bunbury will allow us to put the\\nwalls as early as the year B.C. 307. The next year Anagnia sank from\\na Hernican city, a free ally of Rome, into a town whose people were\\nburthened with Roman citizenship without the Roman franchise. If we may\\ncarry back walls over whose gates Hernican inscriptions could be read\\nbetween four and five hundred years later, to a date as nearly as that,\\nwe shall have done all that we could wish. They will be walls of the\\ndays of Hernican independence, walls on which Hannibal and Pyrrhos have\\nlooked.\\n\\nOne thing is plain, that the builders of the walls of Anagnia, like the\\nbuilders of the cloaca at Rome, but most unlike the elder builders\\nof Cora and Signia, knew as well as any men how to turn arches. On\\nthe highest point of the town, by the modern gate which looks out\\ntowards Ferentino, within the circuit of the ancient arx , we may\\nstill see, blocked, partly hidden by the modern gate, disguised\\nby the arrangements of the medi\\u00e6val castle, the double gate of the\\nancient wall. It is perfectly plain, but with arches thoroughly well\\nturned, with a double range of voussoirs. A smaller arch of the same\\nworkmanship beside them looks almost as if it had been blocked from the\\nbeginning. The arx itself, it should be remembered, had its separate\\nwall within that of the city, a noble fragment of which, of exactly the\\nsame character as the town wall, is still to be seen in a narrow street\\na little lower down.\\n\\nWhen we actually reach Anagni, there can be no doubt that the character\\nin which it chiefly strikes us is that of the city of the Hernican\\nwalls, if Hernican walls we may call them. But historically Anagni is\\nso far more famous as the city of medi\\u00e6val Popes that it is fitting\\nthat it should have something to show in that character also. The\\ntown is rich in medi\\u00e6val fragments. The main street, in its winding\\ncourses, displays long ranges of blocked arcades, round and pointed,\\nwhich, when open, must have given it, narrow and often dim as it is,\\nno small measure of stateliness. Not a few buildings stand out with\\narches of vast height and boldness, suggesting, as it is fit that one\\npapal city should suggest to another, the mighty works of Rome's absent\\nBishops at Avignon. Not remarkable for height, but most remarkable for\\ntheir span, are the exceedingly bold arches which support the communal\\npalace, once, it is said, the dwelling of the Popes, a building which,\\non its northern side, shows a range of windows which savour of France\\nor England rather than of Italy. The houses with their staircases\\noften present highly picturesque shapes, which in one house in the\\nmain street, where the outside staircase is sheltered by two arches\\nresting on a graceful column, grow into a form of genuine beauty. And\\nan elegant form of double window, two round arches divided by a slender\\nshaft, is characteristic of the architecture of Anagni. It is needless\\nto add that at Anagni, as everywhere else in Italy, most of these\\nrelics of the skill of former times have been mercilessly disfigured\\nand mutilated.\\n\\nIn the ecclesiastical line the other churches supply a few good\\nfragments of the same character as those in the domestic building; but\\nthe cathedral church within the arx is the only one which has the\\nleast claim to be looked on as a striking whole. It stands boldly on\\nthe edge of the hill with its east end -- that is, what would be east\\naccording to northern rules, for it is in truth nearly west -- rising\\nup nobly with its three apses in good Romanesque style, while a\\nstately bell-tower of the more massive sort, though sadly marred on\\ntwo sides, stands near the east end which should be west. The crypt is\\nin a somewhat ruder form of the same style. The whole outside of the\\nchurch is worth study; the inside is of an early and massive type of\\nthe Italian Gothic, always, unless in the case of some unusual merit,\\nless satisfactory than Italian Romanesque. The sacristy contains\\nthe vestments of Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., and a good many\\nother curious objects. The church is just now suffering restoration;\\nlet us hope that nothing very dreadful will happen to it. There, at\\nleast, seems no disposition to pull down the apse, after the pattern\\nof the church which Popes and Emperors alike have decreed to be the\\nmother-church of Rome and of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Ferentino.\\n\\n\\nItaly contains two places bearing the name of Ferentinum or Ferentino,\\nas England contains two places -- perhaps more -- bearing the several\\nnames of Leeds, Stafford, Birmingham, Hereford, Cambridge, Washington,\\nRochester, and others more obvious. And as the Northumbrian Rochester\\nis also very conveniently written Rutchester , so the Etruscan\\nFerentinum is also conveniently written Ferentia . On an iter ad\\nBrundisium we cannot possibly have anything to do with Etruscan\\nFerentia; our business lies with that Ferentinum which, according to\\nthe Itineraries, was to be found on the Via Latina between Anagnia\\nand Frusino, and which is to be found there still. But if the name\\nof the southern Ferentinum is more certain than that of its fellow,\\nits ancient nationality is less certain. Its historical position is\\nHernican; it lies between Hernican Anagnia and Hernican Frusino; yet\\nit is also spoken of as Volscian, as it may well have become in the\\nendless warfare of those ever-shifting nations. Yet it is in other\\ncompany that we should be best pleased to find it. Our earliest\\nremembrance of the name places \\\"Ferentinum of the rock\\\" among the\\nThirty Cities, and gives it no mean place among them. We go to the spot\\nwith the lines ringing in our ears which place its warriors under the\\nrule of proud Tarquin himself, on the spot where -- \\n\\n ... in the centre thickest\\n Were ranged the shields of foes,\\n And from the centre loudest\\n The cry of battle rose.\\n\\nYet, even without book, we may have been a little surprised both to\\nfind a Thirty-city so far in the heart of the Volscian and Hernican\\nhills, and to find its warriors marshalled along with such distant\\ncomrades as Tibur and Pedum and \\\"Gabii of the pool.\\\" And, when we\\ncome back to our books, a horrible thought presses itself upon us more\\nand more, a thought that Ferentinum may have no right to any place in\\nthat list at all. The name seems to be Lord Macaulay's guess -- among a\\nhundred other guesses -- at the manifestly corrupt name which comes next\\nbefore Gabii in Dionysios' list of the Latin cities. Some read as near\\nto our mark as Fortinei ; so we may hope for the best; but remembering\\nwhere Ferentinum stands, very far from Gabii, we confess that our hopes\\nare small.\\n\\nIn obedience to the Itinerary, it is from Anagni that we make our way\\nto Ferentino. And as we go from Anagni to Ferentino, we better take\\nin the special position of Anagni on the top of its isolated hill.\\nTill we have gone some little distance, we are hardly conscious that\\nAnagni is there at all; gradually the bell-tower rises into view, and\\nthe rest of the city follows. A few miles only lead us from the hill\\nof Anagni to the hill of Ferentino. At the first glance it may be that\\nthe spot which we have reached does not specially strike as \\\"Ferentinum\\nof the rock.\\\" It does not seem to stand on such steep cliffs as many\\nother hill-fortresses, Norba pre-eminently among them. But, when we\\nbegin to follow the line of the walls, we find out that, whether Lord\\nMacaulay is right or wrong in speaking of Ferentinum at all, he has\\nat least chosen his epithet wisely. Ferentinum is Ferentinum of the\\nrock. Large parts of the wall stand directly on vast masses of rock,\\nand sometimes rock and wall almost lose themselves in one another.\\nAnd the walls of Ferentino certainly yield in interest to none of\\nour series. They are still standing through the greater part of their\\nancient circuit, and for the most part they are of two manifest dates,\\ndiffering in material and construction. There is an original lower\\npart of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as\\nrude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which\\nthis earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,\\nbut it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later\\nrepairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction\\nof very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were\\nnot for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work\\nhas a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction\\nand material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work\\nby the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the\\narch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.\\nThe only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with\\nmerely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from\\nthe modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones\\nof the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient\\nentrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they\\nwere, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take\\na military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.\\nAnother gate, now known as Porta Maggiore , is a much more elaborate\\nwork, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is\\nplaced with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall\\nturns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great\\nadvantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows\\nwhether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult\\njust at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes\\nleast interesting. When we have to scramble -- all at least save Alpine\\nclimbers -- with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,\\nwe are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of\\nconstruction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to\\nrefer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no\\nsuch necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,\\nand the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed\\nat the same time. And at one point, not far from the Porta Maggiore ,\\nit will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long\\ninscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,\\nAulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part\\nat Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later\\nat Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of\\nhis day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty\\nbushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the\\nboys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the\\nwill of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity\\nCommissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get\\ntheir nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance -- yet\\nmany well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf -- will they\\ndevise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the\\nbenefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions\\nnearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the Times \\nwas filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in\\nSomerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once\\nstanding in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In\\none point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more\\nlucky. When Ferentinum had quatuorviri , they did not bury people in\\ntheir temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to\\npeople who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates\\nthe bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to\\nbe seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,\\nas a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his\\nbenefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated\\nby Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we\\ntrust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,\\nPopes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull\\ndown buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and\\nvillas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which\\nshould go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.\\n\\nWe have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we\\nwish -- we must confess the weakness -- to see independent Hernicans\\nwherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come\\nback and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum\\nspoken of, without any special emotion, as \\\"Roman.\\\" We look up\\nagain in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word\\ncertainly means something quite different from what it commonly\\nmeans in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light\\non anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us\\nto accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far\\nback as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think\\nthat the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old\\nCorinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great\\npiece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more\\nimportant -- though about the comparative importance some might raise a\\ndoubt -- than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them\\nby the proper road; we must get into what once was the arx , what\\nis now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,\\necclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly\\nthrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or\\nhouses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that\\nFerentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,\\nand several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed\\nat Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept\\nasunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the\\nsmall and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The\\nmost striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the\\nmass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the\\nbell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the arx , as a\\nmighty sub-structure. The walls of the arx show the same two dates\\nas the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude\\nstones of the first period; at another part they support the upper\\nrange of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to\\nHernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the\\n\\\"Roman\\\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of\\nthe censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius -- censors, that is, not\\nof Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first\\nvolume of the great Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum , p. 238, and\\nits closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the Priscae\\nLatinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica . Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus\\nLollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known\\npersons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one\\nasks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got\\nhold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They\\nhad no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they\\nare written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the\\nRoman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have\\nbuilt what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside\\nonly mean that they built the later work on the top of the prim\\u00e6val\\nwall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an\\narchaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in\\nthe Tabularium of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row\\nof triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \\\"Cornelius Lucius Scipio\\nGnaivod patre prognatus.\\\" But we need not go back quite so far as his\\nday. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla\\nwill do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans\\nof Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.\\nFerentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns\\nwhich were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows\\nis most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,\\nrefused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather\\nto remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,\\nthe old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of\\nthe Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and\\nmagistrates -- Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them -- subject\\nonly to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars\\nof Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful\\nRomans.\\n\\nThis last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.\\n3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth\\nthe wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman pr\\u00e6tor suddenly\\nwished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for\\nherself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so\\nher husband bade the two qu\\u00e6stors of the town to be seized; one was\\nscourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the\\nwords of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which\\nRoman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities\\neven of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.\\n\\nIt is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the town as\\na municipium , while Livy also casually implies its possession of the\\nLatin franchise. Such obiter dicta do not go for very much. Scholars\\nsometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only\\ncasual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus\\nnot long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to\\naccuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the\\nWest of England. We here read of \\\"the county of the city of Bristol,\\\"\\nthe \\\"borough of Gloucester,\\\" the \\\"borough of Bath,\\\" and the \\\"borough of\\nTaunton.\\\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting\\nthat Bath is a \\\"city\\\" and Gloucester even a \\\"county of a city.\\\" May\\nwe not sometimes get wrong about municipia and Latin colonies from\\nthe same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a\\n municipium , but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,\\nwe once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the\\nelectors of a county to elect, not a \\\"knight of the shire,\\\" as they\\nhad done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called\\na \\\"member of Parliament.\\\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and\\neven Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,\\n curiae , and centuries, in ages long before their own day?\\n\\nThe walls then, though called \\\"Roman\\\" in a vague sense -- that is, it\\nwould seem, simply not prim\\u00e6val, like those of Cori and Segni -- are\\ndoubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was\\nstill a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most\\nlikely the walls over which the unlucky qu\\u00e6stor threw himself. The\\nwalls of the arx , where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,\\nconnect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the\\ninscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and\\nfrom the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral -- a\\nvery good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.\\nThe church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal\\ndamaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its\\nbell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A\\nlittle restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make\\nit into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,\\nunless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,\\nantiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little\\nminster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except\\nby comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if\\nthe church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime\\nof the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what\\nwe heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the\\ncrime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually\\nbegun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as\\nyet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse\\nto drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.\\n\\nThe church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen\\nthere in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant\\nvoice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the\\n arx -- buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account -- strange\\ntales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place\\neither in history or in received legend. Among other things he was\\nthrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a\\nvery pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one\\ndesigns to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,\\nit strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or\\nas we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other\\necclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city\\nof the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these\\nplaces; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which\\nhas an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people\\nwho chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome\\nlose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy\\nplaces of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and\\nanother creed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. Alatri.\\n\\n\\nThe tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with prim\\u00e6val walls, among\\nwhich we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at\\nAlatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly\\nclaim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest\\nplace, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is\\nthe one which has the least history. There is very little to say about\\nit, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but\\npreferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the\\nproffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained\\na distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least\\nthere can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich\\nin medi\\u00e6val antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich\\nin Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or\\nless Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri\\nnearly everything that we care about is strictly prim\\u00e6val. We cannot\\nreasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look\\nwere there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new\\nthen.\\n\\nAlatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in\\nall ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no\\nplace in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni\\nor Ferentino -- nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of\\ngoing and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked\\non as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without\\ncalling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are\\nnow following -- a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among\\nthem -- reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there\\nafter seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant\\njustice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed\\nit out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a\\nresting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of\\nAlatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from\\nits railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern\\nworld, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible\\nbell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to\\nAlatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for\\na while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what\\nthey saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the\\nAlatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of\\nthe walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the arx , are the most\\nprominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond\\nour immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited\\ntown. At Alatri indeed the prim\\u00e6val walls are so prominent that in the\\ndistant view no one would suspect them of being prim\\u00e6val walls at all.\\nThey are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what\\nmay be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still\\nfence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as\\nin so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal\\nprecinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and\\ncentral character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The arx \\nis not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the\\nwall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The arx \\nforms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point\\nof the compass on the mountains which keep watch around -- on the little\\ntowns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights -- on\\nthe houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill\\nwhich the arx crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a\\nchurch or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding\\nsite, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These\\nhill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;\\nat Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their\\nheights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper\\ncompanions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which\\nsurrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more\\nworthy building, either the prim\\u00e6val temple itself or some more fitting\\nsuccessor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs -- let\\nus say either the Parthen\\u00f4n of Athens or the Parthen\\u00f4n of Lincoln to\\ndo it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral\\nchurch of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the\\n cella of the prim\\u00e6val temple. Here we have something even more than\\ncan be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way\\nof a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are\\nconcerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church\\nwas actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house\\ngoing back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded\\nage which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There\\nis the terrace, there is the wall of the cella , wrought of the same\\nwonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding arx , as the walls\\nof the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the\\nordinary rites of Christian worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a\\nChristian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples\\nof a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them\\nwithin walls reared in honour of we know not what -- gods of unchronicled\\ndays, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed\\nas strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of\\nJupiter of the Capitol.\\n\\nWhere the pr\\u00e6historic temple has thus become the cathedral church, it\\nis not out of keeping that the wall of the pr\\u00e6historic arx should\\nbecome the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see\\nfrom afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly\\nfurnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can\\ndistinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air\\nof a wall even of Roman, even of medi\\u00e6val, antiquity. Shall we say it?\\nAs we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the arx of\\nAlatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We\\ncould not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular\\nand rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than\\nat Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls\\nin the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls\\nbuilt on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business\\ncommonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,\\nto strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have\\nlittle or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached\\nfrom within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this\\narrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a\\nwall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.\\nThe weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at\\nthis point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which\\nthe hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are\\nwhich are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in\\nthe walls of Alatri, whether of temple, arx , or city, do we find\\nanything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the\\nstones, of whatever shape -- and they are of many shapes -- have clearly\\nbeen cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though\\nthe system according to which they are laid is not the same in every\\npart of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of\\nconstructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be\\nseen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it\\nis hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor\\ndo we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where\\nwe should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The\\ngreat gateway of the arx at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its\\nbuilders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of\\nthe arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of\\nthe lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. We suppose\\nthat the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge\\nlintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals\\nwhom those of Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea could not have despised. But, except in vastness\\nof construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly\\nplain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with\\nthe really artistic work of the Myk\\u00eanaian treasuries. It goes rather\\nwith the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri\\ncould carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the arx .\\nBut they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great\\ngate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of\\nthe vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the\\ncut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within\\nit, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the\\nsteep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.\\nEven the builders of prim\\u00e6val walls clearly drew a line between what\\nwas meant to meet the public eye and what was not.\\n\\nBut we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,\\nthe walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of\\nAlatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect\\nin the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be\\ntempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular\\norder by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these\\nlast, except that they do not supply anything like the prim\\u00e6val gate,\\nare just as well worthy of study as the walls of the arx itself. They\\nremain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and\\nthey are of the same general construction as the walls of the arx .\\nAt some points a singular contrast is made by medi\\u00e6val additions to\\nthe defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic\\nwindows of the time, stands out as projections from the prim\\u00e6val wall.\\nAnd, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in\\nthe way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the\\nwalls themselves. From the arx of Alatri we look down on several\\nbell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of Santa\\nMaria Maggiore , though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is\\nquite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point\\nof Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or\\nout of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided\\nshaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow\\nstreets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory\\nin every point save one. There should have been some decent building,\\npagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its arx , the noblest\\nin our whole range.\\n\\nWith Alatri we end one main stage of our iter , that of the\\nhill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in\\nthe world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if\\nwe had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of\\nwork. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant\\nand profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and\\nthe Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns\\nare very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in\\nwithout anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to\\nmention that the Locanda d'Italia , at Anagni, recommended in various\\nguide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a\\nnight at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless\\nand letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better\\nthan many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.\\nIndeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed\\nrace. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,\\nperhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make\\nthe best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need\\nbe; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or\\nhe might be a Hernican -- we cannot always be exact among these obsolete\\nnationalities -- \\\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody\\nelse.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. From Alatri to Capua.\\n\\n\\nWe have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not\\nbe hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling\\nin historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to\\nexisting remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the\\nspecial necessities of an iter ad Brundisium carry us to quite other\\nparts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest\\nare fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they\\nare wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their\\nlowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our\\nwork is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant\\ncompanions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their\\nsubstitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond\\nit. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can\\ncarry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway\\nsystem of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea\\nand the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,\\nbeyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters\\nto the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a\\nchance likeness between the names -- a name that ranges from the Euxine\\nto the Hudson -- without seeking in any sort to identify the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of\\nDionysios and the \\u1f08\\u03bb\\u03b2\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03bf\\u03af of imperial Anna, it is still with a curious\\nfeeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before were\\nlooking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the wilder\\nmountains of Albania.\\n\\nSome of those who now looked across had already learned something of\\nthose heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new\\nfeeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look\\nout on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the\\nwestern world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped\\nthemselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the\\nAlbanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to\\nbeing to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to\\nthe East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the\\nboot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on\\nthe western side of the great backbone of Italy; we have still to catch\\nglimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on\\nthe bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of\\ncloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which\\ndecrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must\\ngo and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time\\nwe have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive\\nrange of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass\\nfrom the prim\\u00e6val cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of\\nsouth-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series\\nof churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but\\ntheir memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,\\nnot indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days\\nwhen Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of\\nHellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those\\neastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.\\n\\nGreek influence indeed begins -- some say that it historically began -- on\\nthe western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the\\npresent journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.\\nWe hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from\\nFrosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding\\nourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be\\npassed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious\\ndiscomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that\\nit is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized\\nquarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,\\nhowever, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a\\nfew miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts -- we\\nwill not talk of luxuries -- have fled from Capua and have found their\\nnew home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,\\n Santa Maria di vetere Capua , not the newer Capua on the site of\\nCasilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there\\nagain, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in\\nthe way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far\\nin advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to\\nLondon. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.\\nThe name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early medi\\u00e6val\\nCapua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the\\ntown now called Capua, but at the village -- it is hardly more -- of Santa\\nMaria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of\\nSamnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the\\ncity where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of\\nblood.\\n\\nOn our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or\\nnew. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder\\nCapua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has\\nbeen chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the\\nhistoric traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at\\neither, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small\\nvalue in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.\\nIt is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,\\nto look again on the amphitheatre of Capua -- Capua, the mistress of\\nRome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of\\namphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,\\neven of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with\\na general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan\\namphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they\\nhardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far\\nless perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than\\nat Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman\\nColiseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,\\nwhile of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how\\nmuch is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the medi\\u00e6val\\nbarons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than\\nat Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up\\nfrom underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.\\nIf any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is\\nnot a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that\\nthe inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation\\nand enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems\\nto imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at\\nleast, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It\\nillustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the\\ntaste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.\\n\\nBesides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes\\nand designs which line the road -- one of which is indeed singularly\\nlike a model of an amphitheatre -- the true Capua has little to show\\nbesides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,\\none which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid\\nthan Rome, so utterly gone -- or rather to see the little that is left of\\nit translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we\\nbegin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,\\nremained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the\\nlast remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.\\nAs such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the\\ncity itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may\\nbe sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city\\nby the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian\\nriver, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni\\nand Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than\\nFlorence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking\\nof the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the arx of\\nCapua could have stood, if we are to understand by an arx something\\nset upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to\\nlater ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The\\nSamnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,\\nhad become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of\\nthe mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.\\n\\n \\\"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\\\"\\n\\nsays the line which comes as such a relief after the involved\\nconstructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as\\nsimply worded as it could be in a medi\\u00e6val chronicle, which gives us\\na true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without\\na single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was\\ndoubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,\\nwho had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment\\nto the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was\\nlargely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the\\nlarge amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any\\nmeasure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua\\nfor a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the\\nRoman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who\\nfilled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once\\nmore a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came\\nnot as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,\\nand when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the\\nkeeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those\\nremnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the arx of Capua, are not\\nto be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his\\nfirst or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan\\n arx , he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their\\nlowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the\\nCampanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we\\ncome to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way\\nto a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan\\namphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of\\nTifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his\\ncamp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the\\nholy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain\\nwhich rises above its massy tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.\\n\\n\\nWe reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching\\nof Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of\\nbeleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout\\nfighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his\\nlast hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the\\ndanger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in\\nsome tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks\\nwhich doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no\\nlake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend\\non Tifata as grew round -- \\n\\n Those trees in whose dim shadow\\n The ghastly priest doth reign,\\n The priest who slew the slayer,\\n And shall himself be slain.\\n\\nYet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent\\nforth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest\\nforms into which any kind of Italian or Hellenic worship strayed\\nmight well seem mild. In tracking the career of Hannibal, we are ever\\ndisappointed at the utter lack of means to call up a picture of the\\nman himself apart from his public acts. He had human weaknesses, for\\nhe found a mistress at Salapia. He had his sallies of merriment, for\\nhe could raise a laugh at the grave Gisgo. But the course of his inner\\nlife is hidden from us. Still we can at least see that he was, in his\\nown belief, charged with a mission from the gods of his own city. And\\nit needs an effort to bear in mind that the gods of Hannibal were Baal\\nand Moloch. The goddess to whom he would have reared a temple would\\nhave been, not a Diana, but an Ashtoreth. Yet, among the many, and\\nmostly false, charges of cruelty brought against the great Ph\\u0153nician\\nby Roman writers, we do not hear, as we do in the case of some other\\nCarthaginian commanders, of captives being made to pass through the\\nfire to the gods of Carthage. Hannibal, the friend of Capua, would at\\nCapua honour Diana of Tifata; but it was not Diana that had sent him.\\nWith what thanks did he honour his own gods, when Capua, second city\\nof all Italy, welcomed the victor of Trebia, Trasimenus, and Cann\\u00e6? Is\\nit too bold a flight to fancy the mount of Tifata the scene of the same\\nform of Baal-worship as the mount of Carmel?\\n\\nBut the gods of Italy lived on, undisturbed by the momentary presence\\nof Semitic rivals. Diana was not the only power worshipped on Tifata;\\nJupiter also had his holy place. And it may be that the venerable\\nchurch which now forms the chief attraction of the hill-side represents\\nthe holy place of Jupiter rather than the holy place of Diana. It is\\ncurious to see how a kind of appropriateness was often sought after in\\nthe nomenclature of Pagan temples when turned into Christian churches.\\nThus, at Athens, the Parthen\\u00f4n remained the Parthen\\u00f4n, while the temple\\nof the warrior Th\\u00easeus or H\\u00earakl\\u00eas became the church of the warrior\\nGeorge. We should look for a Santa Maria or a Santa Lucia at\\nthe least, on the site of the sanctuary of Diana. Had we here a San\\nPietro , we should have very little doubt in setting down the prince\\nof the Apostles as having supplanted the father of gods and men. But\\nat Sant' Angelo in Formis we feel somewhat less certain; St. Michael\\nsuggests the Norman, and the Norman has been there. It may well be that\\nthe name is no older than his day.\\n\\nBut St. Michael on the slope of Tifata did carry us back in thought to\\na church of St. Peter seen some months before under a widely different\\nstate of outward things. We then made a somewhat difficult journey to a\\ngreat and solitary Tuscan basilica in time of snow. The outward aspect\\nof nature had certainly changed a good deal between the bleak day in\\nJanuary when it was found a hard task to follow the way from Pisa to\\nthe basilica of the prince of the Apostles in Grado and the sunny day\\nin May when the same travellers found their way without difficulties of\\nany kind to the basilica of the prince of the archangels in Formis .\\nAnd there certainly can be no likeness of position, even if both were\\nseen in January or both in May, between the basilica standing low in\\nthe flats by the mouth of Arno and the basilica which nestles against\\nthe mountains which form a wall to the rich plain of Vulturnus. But\\nin seeing any one of these great churches, left, not ruined, like\\nour Cistercian abbeys, but still living on a kind of life in places\\nforsaken or nearly so, something always brings up the memory of some\\nother of its fellows. Aquileia is perhaps the greatest case of all; but\\nAquileia, with its special position in the history of the world, stands\\nby itself. If Aquileia itself is dead, it has lived on a wonderful\\nafter-life in the shape of its Venetian colony. We go to see Aquileia,\\nbecause it is Aquileia; but even a well-informed traveller may know\\nnothing of San Pietro in Grado and Sant' Angelo in Formis , till\\neither his guide-book or some earlier visitor points them out to him\\nas places which he ought not to pass by. Aquileia again has other\\nthings to show besides the great basilica and its surroundings. St.\\nApollinaris in Classe is as nearly forsaken as a church that is still\\nkept up can be; but the basilica of Classis does not stand by itself;\\nit forms part of the wonders of Ravenna, as St. Paul without-the-Walls\\nforms part of the wonders of Rome. St. Peter in Grado might be looked\\non as standing in the same relation to Pisa; but it hardly enters\\ninto our general conception of Pisa, as the church of Classis -- papal\\nhavoc hinders us from adding the church of C\\u00e6sarea -- certainly enters\\ninto our general conception of Ravenna. S. Angelo in Formis at all\\nevents does not enter into our general conception of old Capua, because\\nthere is not enough of old Capua left to form any general conception\\nof it at all. The church and the small surrounding village do form\\na kind of distant arx to the greater collection of houses which\\nsurrounds the amphitheatre; but among the nearer objects which catch\\nthe eye from the height, the most prominent is not old Capua with its\\namphitheatre, but new Capua, Casilinum that once was, with its towers\\nand cupolas, medi\\u00e6val and modern. We look on many things from the\\nterrace in front of the portico of the archangel, but that which among\\nartificial objects chiefly draws the eye towards it, is not the elder\\nCapua of Hannibal and Marcellus, but the Capua which succeeded Aversa\\nas the seat of the elder but the less famous of the Norman powers in\\nSouthern Italy. As we mark the advance of national union, no less than\\nas we mark the advance of mere dynastic aggression, we have sometimes\\nto think, for a moment perhaps to mourn, that \\\"kingdoms have shrunk\\nto provinces,\\\" though in this form of advance and incorporation, we\\nhave no longer to add that \\\"chains clank over sceptred cities.\\\" Capua,\\non both its sites, once the head of an Etruscan, once of a Norman\\ndominion, passed, in one age, under the universal rule of Rome. In\\nanother age it again sank from its separate headship to become a member\\nof that greater Norman dominion in Apulia and Sicily which, after\\nmore shiftings, unions, divisions, transfers to distant rulers, than\\nany other part of Europe, has in our days been merged in the realm of\\nunited Italy, with Rome as its head, but not its mistress.\\n\\nWe reach then the height which, whether that of Jupiter or Diana of\\nold, is now the height of the warrior archangel. The whole history of\\nthe church belongs to the independent days of the second Capua; in its\\npresent shape it belongs to the days of independent Norman rule in the\\nsecond Capua. But the days of independent Norman rule were days when\\nthe arts of the earlier rulers of the land still lived on. We see signs\\nof the art of Byzantium, so long mistress of Southern Italy, and of\\nthe art of the Saracen, in Italy only a visitor or an invader, while in\\nSicily an abiding master. The portico in front of the church is Roman\\nin its general idea; but, instead of the colonnade and entablature\\nof the Laurentian basilica, we see an arcade whose pointed arches at\\nonce call up memories of Sicily. They have indeed little of Sicilian\\ngrace. Nowhere at Palermo or Monreale do we see such massive columns\\nbearing such massive stilts. Columns indeed we should hardly say, as\\nsome of them are plainly mere fragments. But here, just as in Sicily,\\njust as in Aquitaine, the pointed arch is no sign of coming Gothic;\\nthe style is still wholly Romanesque, and somewhat rude Romanesque\\ntoo. And in this region of Italy we can hardly doubt as to attributing\\nthe almost accidental shape of the arches to the influence of Saracen\\nmodels, perhaps to the workmanship of Saracen craftsmen. Hard by, but\\nnot joining the building, by an arrangement unlike Sicily, unlike\\nApulia, but the common rule of Northern Italy, rises a bell-tower,\\nor rather the beginning of a bell-tower, which raises our wonder as\\nto what it would have been if it had ever grown to its full height.\\nTwo stages only are finished, the lower of hewn stone, the upper of\\nbrick; but their bulk is so great that the tower, if it had ever been\\nfinished, would surely have ranked among the highest of its class,\\nutterly overpowering even the great basilica at its side, except so\\nfar as it would have been itself overpowered by the natural heights\\nabove it. As in some other cases, the thought suggests itself, were not\\nthose who left off building the tower wiser than those who began it?\\nThe tall bell-towers of Italy look well as they rise from the Lombard\\nplain, as they crown the hill of Fiesole, as they skirt the shores of\\nthe lake of Como. But we are not sure that a gigantic tower, which, if\\nit was to have any kind of proportion, ought to have been carried up\\nto a height as great as that of Venice, was in its right place when\\nset a little way up a mountain-side, as if simply to show how small\\nman's biggest works look in the midst of the works of nature. But the\\ntechnical eye is thankful for the fragment that has been built, though\\nmainly on a very technical ground. Professor Willis is gone, but his\\nhappy phrase of mid-wall shafts has not died with him. The custom\\nof the elder Romanesque towers, the abiding fashion of Germany and\\nNorthern Italy, was to set the little columns which divided the coupled\\nwindows in the very middle of the wall; the latter Norman fashion,\\nwhether in Normandy, in England, or in Apulia, was to set them nearly\\nflush with the outer wall. In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman\\nby allegiance, two sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman\\nfashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters\\nof detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious\\nthought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise\\nbetween two rival forms of taste.\\n\\nThe outside of this church, except so far as it forms an object in\\nthe general landscape, is perhaps chiefly attractive to the technical\\nobserver; the inside will surely appeal to every visitor, though the\\nvisitor who is technically informed in matters of painting may possibly\\nlook upon it with more of curiosity than of positive admiration. But\\nthe eye of the more general inquirer will give something like positive\\nadmiration to a basilica of eight arches, resting on ancient columns\\nof various marbles, with its original design far less damaged than is\\ncommon in Italian churches, and with every inch of available space\\ncovered with elaborate paintings of the date of the building. Like\\nSt. Peter by Pisa, the archangel by Capua trusted to painting for his\\nenrichment and not to mosaics; and though the Campanian pictures are by\\nfar the better preserved of the two, though nearly all the subjects can\\nbe made out with the greatest ease, yet Ravenna and Venice rise to the\\nmind to make us think that at least if endurance be the object, there\\nis a more excellent way.\\n\\nThe walls of this church form almost a pictorial Bible, with a few\\nlegendary and local subjects thrown in. The Abbot Desiderius, holding,\\nafter the usual symbolical fashion, the church in his hand, is to be\\nseen at the east end along with the archangels and evangelists. At\\nthe west end is what connoisseurs tell us is one of the very earliest\\npictures of the Last Judgment. On the two sides a crowd of scenes and\\nfigures from the Old and New Testament cover the whole space. The style\\nof the painting is said to show Greek workmanship; we look toward the\\nwest end and mark, hardly above the ground, a single small shaft with\\na capital of strictly Byzantine character. The ruling Norman seems on\\nthis spot to have pressed into his service the artistic powers of all\\nthe inhabitants of the peninsula. Italian, Greek, Saracen, all give\\ntheir help to adorn the house of the archangel. The Norman himself\\ncontributes nothing but the position of two small columns in the tower\\nwindows. We cannot even attribute to him the position of the house of\\nthe archangel, set Norman-fashion in a high place; for the first church\\nwas built before the Norman came. It is not so further east, where a\\ndistinctively Norman element is to be seen in the great churches of\\nApulia. But the gathering together of the best skill of the time from\\nall quarters is a thoroughly Norman function, whether in Italy or in\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe basilica should be compassed, so far at least as to climb the\\nhill a little way to look at its east end. Its surrounding buildings\\nsupply an arch or two to catch the eye on the way up or down. But the\\nessential features of Sant' Angelo are the grand display of painting\\nand the union of elements of so many kinds. It is the first of a great\\nseries of churches at which our course will bid us to stop here and\\nthere. But before we reach them we shall pass by one point where our\\nmusings will again be mainly secular and largely pagan. A short journey\\nwill lead us from Campania into Samnium, and the valiant men of the\\nSamnite land will claim a tribute on a spot which is Samnite beyond all\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. A Glimpse of Samnium.\\n\\n\\nFrom Caserta and what is to be seen from Caserta, our next journey lies\\nby the line of railway which runs right across Italy, connecting the\\ntwo great lines of the east and west of the peninsula. It leads us from\\nthe Campanian plain, with at least its sheltering wall of mountains,\\nwith Tifata to guard the great city that once was from the ruder land\\nbeyond, to the great plain of Apulia from which every feature of a\\nmountain-land has passed away. But, in so crossing from one side of\\nItaly to the other, we pass through a striking and an historic region.\\nWe are in the land of the mightiest Italian rivals of Rome, the land\\nof those with whom Rome had to fight, before Pyrrhos and Hannibal came,\\nand ages after Pyrrhos and Hannibal were gone.\\n\\nOur course leads us into the heart of the Samnite land, a land which\\nmay well call up endless musings on the hard fate of those \\\"hearts of\\nsteel\\\" who bore up so long against Rome, in the days when Rome was\\nreally at her greatest. And the memories of the same land in after\\ndays are not wholly alien to those of earlier times. Our course brings\\nus, at not a few points, across the memories, if not of nations, yet\\nof men, who had to bear up against the power of Rome, when the power\\nof Rome had taken a far other form than that of the senate and the\\narmies against which the Samnite had to strive. For the old Samnite\\nland holds its place in later story, as the land of princes who felt\\nwhat the spiritual Rome could do when the powers of the spiritual\\nRome were at their highest. We pass through regions which were the\\nscene of no small part of the history of the Norman and Swabian lords\\nof Sicily and Southern Italy. We are deep in the land of the counts,\\ndukes, kings, and emperors of the house of Hauteville and the house\\nof Hohenstaufen; and we are often called on to stop and track out\\ntheir deeds. At not a few points do we light on some building, some\\ninscription, which brings up the memory of Frederick, the Wonder of\\nthe World, and of Manfred, whose field of overthrow we shall presently\\npass by. In both periods the history of these lands has a character\\naltogether different from that of Northern and Central Italy. In the\\nlater period this needs no proof: we are dealing with the history of\\na kingdom, not with the history of a system of separate cities. But\\nsomething of the same difference extends to the earlier period also. If\\nwe wish to know more of Volscians and Hernicans, yet more keenly do we\\nwish to know more of Samnites. The part which they played is greater,\\nat all events in scale, and their dealings with Rome belong to a stage\\nof Roman history when we feel that we have a kind of right to know\\nmore than we could hope to know in the earlier time. But while we know\\nsomething of the character of the Samnite people as a whole, while we\\nknow something -- though much less than in some other Italian lands -- of\\nthe geography of the Samnite country, we have no clear notion of the\\npolitical position or the political action of any particular Samnite\\ncity or canton, such as we ever and anon do get of particular cities\\nof Etruria and Latium. And again, it is seldom that we can call up\\nany distinct personal conception of any Samnite leader as a living and\\nbreathing man. This is indeed a grievance which affects Samnites along\\nwith the other Italian enemies of Rome. The personal conceptions which\\nwe do get of Etruscans and Latins largely belong to legendary times. Of\\nhistorical Volscians we know very few. And we have already complained\\non Hernican ground that we cannot picture to ourselves the personal\\nlikeness of any single Hernican of independent Hernican days.\\n\\nStill, on this particular journey we have small right to complain;\\nfor we pass by the spot which calls up the memories of the most\\nmemorable Samnites of whom we have any personal knowledge. They are\\nmen of one name, most likely therefore of one house, and men of whom\\nwe emphatically wish to know more than we do know. Leaving Caserta\\nbehind, glancing at the Campanian plain and the Campanian mountains,\\nmarking Naples only by the smoke of the distant city, we pass along\\nthrough what, in our simplicity, we take to be the vale of Vulturnus,\\ntill we light on a more classical friend, armed with a more classical\\nmap, who explains that the stream which we are tracing is in strictness\\nnot Vulturnus himself, but only his tributary Calor. Anyhow we go\\nalong its course into the heart of the Samnite land, and we pass by\\none spot -- a spot which we ought to have treated better than merely to\\npass it by, a spot round which the greatest memories of Samnite history\\ngather, and where they strangely interweave themselves with wholly\\ndifferent memories of the history of our own land. We reach Telesia,\\nthe home of the Pontii, and we remember that Telesia was also for a\\nmoment the home of Anselm. Our guide-book provokingly fails us; but\\nthe large building on the hill-side must surely be the monastery where\\nhe sojourned. There are Roman antiquities in the place; for Samnite\\nantiquities we do not look. But did Samnites build no walls, or do the\\nmighty bulwarks of Cori and Segni mark an earlier state of things than\\nthe Sabellian occupation of Southern Italy? Anyhow, we are here at the\\nplace which has attached itself as a surname to the two most memorable\\nmen in the scanty personal history of Samnium. Here, on his own\\nground, we remember that Gaius Pontius who spared Rome's army at the\\nCaudine Forks, and who lived to be led, twenty-seven years later, as a\\nspectacle in a Roman triumph, to end his days, one might almost say as\\na martyr, by the axe of the headsman in a Roman dungeon. So we used to\\nread the tale in our youth; so moralized the historians of our youth\\nover the special baseness which handed over such a man to such an end.\\nOr are we to adopt the new reading of the tale which at least saves\\nQuintus Fabius Maximus from that special stain of blood-guiltiness\\nwhich cleaves to the canonized memory of Divus Julius? It may be\\nwell if we can believe that one of the worthiest heroes of the old\\ncommonwealth, if he could not forestall the magnanimity of Pompeius and\\nAurelian, at least did not sink to the special and petty spite of the\\nmurderer of Vercingetorix. We are now taught that the Gaius Pontius\\nwho appears twenty-seven years after the first mention of that name,\\nis most likely not the same man as the merciful victor of the Caudine\\nForks. If this be so, then Quintus Fabius, in consigning his Pontius\\nto the axe, merely conformed to the cruel custom of his nation, without\\nthe further aggravation of slaying in cold blood one who had dealt with\\nRome so nobly. And after all some might hint that the oldest Pontius\\nof all was the wisest. It may be that the sage old father of Gaius\\nknew human nature best, when he bade his son either to massacre the\\nwhole Roman army or else to let them go free without terms. It may be\\nthat the son chose a more dangerous path than either, when he took to\\ndiplomacy and middle courses.\\n\\nBut if the earlier Pontius of Telesia should prove -- though the guess\\nis a simple guess -- to be in truth two Pontii, perhaps a father and a\\nson, no doubt seems to have fixed itself on the identity of the last\\nPontius at the Colline gate of Rome. The rising again of Samnite life\\nat the last moment of all, when the war with the allies seemed to have\\nlost itself in the deeper whirlpool of the war of Marius and Sulla,\\nis really the most striking thing in the whole history, such as we\\nhave it, of the Samnite people. We are taken by surprise when, in\\ndays when Rome already seems the fully established head, not only of\\nItaly, but of all the Mediterranean world, her power, her very being,\\nis threatened by the leader of a nation which seemed to have been dead\\nand buried for some centuries. But, just like the Volumnian tomb in\\none way, so the Samnite resurrection in another way is a witness to\\nthe real life which the other states of Italy kept on under a form\\nof Roman dominion which made them externally dependent, which threw\\nits influence into the scale of oligarchy in their external affairs,\\nwhich ever and anon subjected them to some irregular demand, but which\\nleft the general course of their lives to be whatever they themselves\\nchose it to be. In the days of Marius and Sulla, Etruscans and Samnites\\nwere still Etruscans and Samnites; they had not become Romans, nor had\\nthey merged their being in any common name of Italians. The Social War\\nitself was the first attempt at forming a general Italian nationality.\\nBut the last campaign of the last Pontius shows how deep, in Samnite\\nhearts at least, was the earlier feeling, the feeling which knew\\nno greater whole than the federal union of Etruria or Samnium. It\\nshows too how specially deep was the feeling of hatred for the single\\ncity which had brought down so many cities and leagues to become its\\nhelpless dependents. Against Pontius at the Colline gate Rome fought\\nfor life, as she had never fought since the old days when she had to\\nguard herself against enemies who lived within sight of her capitol.\\nForeign invaders, Pyrrhos, Hannibal himself, did not come with the\\nsame fixed purpose of rooting up the wood which sheltered the wolves of\\nItaly. We can hardly doubt that it is the hand of Sulla which from that\\nday to this has hindered the south of Italy from being like the north.\\nBut the blow which crushed the Samnite people as the other nations of\\nItaly were not crushed, was vengeance taken for a moment when it once\\nmore became a question whether Rome should rule over Italy, whether\\nRome should exist at all.\\n\\nAt Telesia we look out, and muse on what might have been, if one\\nPontius had done otherwise than he did by the forks of Caudium, if\\nanother Pontius had fared otherwise than he fared at the gates of\\nRome herself. At our next halting-place we are called on, not to muse\\non what might have been, but on what was. At Beneventum we tread the\\nbattle-ground of Pyrrhos and Manfred, the ground of two of the greatest\\nvictories of the Rome of the earlier and the Rome of the later day.\\nThere we need not strive to call up the dim figures of men, like the\\nolder and the later Pontius, known by one action of their lives. The\\nEpeirot and the Swabian stand out as clearly discerned figures in the\\nhistory of their several ages. And the places where we next halt will\\nshow us the place of overthrow for both, the place of death and utter\\nruin for one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Benevento.\\n\\n\\nWe follow the stream of Calore till we reach a city which, without\\never having been one of the great cities of the world, without having\\nbeen even one of the greatest cities of Italy, has always kept up an\\nimportant historic being. Beneventum is a familiar name in all ages;\\nyet Beneventum has never been either a mighty commonwealth like Venice\\nor Genoa, or the head of a mighty kingdom like Naples and Palermo.\\nIt has had its princes; if we never heard of them before, we should\\nlearn a good deal of them by studying the monuments of their city.\\nThat is to say, the monuments will tell us a great deal about princes\\nnine hundred or a thousand years back; no monument that we remember in\\nBenevento tells us anything about the last prince who bore their title.\\nLet us suppose a wanderer who began his travels at Autun and who finds\\nhimself, in the course of the same wandering, at Benevento. He will\\nfeel it as a grotesque coincidence that, not so very long ago, a man\\nwas living who had once been Prince of Benevento and who before that\\nhad been Bishop of Autun. Benevento, among many other things that it\\nis, is also the later city of Talleyrand, as Autun is the earlier. But\\nthere is this difference that one thinks of Talleyrand at Autun and one\\ndoes not think of him at Benevento. At Autun he has his place, though\\na very strange place, in the long succession of Bishops of Autun; at\\nBenevento, though he bore the style of its prince, he stands all alone;\\nwe cannot find a niche for him in the succession of the Beneventan\\nprinces. Yet a prince of Benevento whose existence marks the ending\\nfor a season of the long papal dominion in Benevento reminds us that\\nBenevento had its princes before that papal dominion began. It reminds\\nus of the two distinctive features in the later history of the city.\\nBenevento was first the seat of Lombard princes who, placed on the\\nborders of both empires, contrived to escape all practical submission\\nto either; it was then the seat of an outlying scrap of papal dominion\\nsurrounded on all sides by the Sicilian realm. In both these characters\\nBenevento was a kind of curiosity on the historical map of Europe. But\\nthe city had its ups and downs before those days, and amongst other\\nthings it had gone through a somewhat grotesque change of name. It is\\nhard to believe that a city placed so far inland can really have been\\nof Greek origin; but legend attributed it to a Greek founder, and its\\noldest name had a Greek sound. Greek Maloeis , Samnite Maluentum ,\\nhad, when it was read into Latin Maloventum , an ill sound; so, when\\nthe Samnite stronghold was changed into the Roman colony, it took the\\nname of Beneventum, city of welcome.\\n\\nBeneventum, marked by Procopius as a strong city in a high place,\\nstands low as compared with the true hill-cities. Still, as compared\\nwith Capua, it might itself pass for a hill-city. It has just that\\namount of rise above the river which there commonly is where there is a\\nriver, such a rise as may be seen in many an English town which is not\\nas Durham or Lincoln. We miss the prim\\u00e6val walls of the hill-cities;\\nbut we find, on the other hand, works of Roman and medi\\u00e6val art such as\\nin the hill-cities we do not find. The arch of Trajan has vanished from\\nRome, except so far as it lives in the sculptures which were torn from\\nit to enrich the arch of Constantine. But at Benevento, as at Ancona,\\nthe memorial of the conqueror of Dacia still abides. The Beneventan\\narch may indeed fairly take its place in the Roman series. It belongs\\nessentially to the same class of designs as the arch of Severus and\\nthe arch of Constantine, while it has little in common with its own\\ntall and slender fellow at Ancona. At the same time, since it has, in\\ngeneral effect at least, taken upon itself something of the position\\nof a town-gate, since it bears the name of Porta aurea , to match the\\ngolden gate of Constantinople and the golden gate of Spalato, the arch\\nof Beneventum has now a somewhat greater air of reality than triumphal\\narches commonly have. The weak point of that class of structures\\nis that they are of no use. They do not, like a wall, a gateway, a\\nhouse, a temple, a hall of council, serve any purpose in the ordinary\\neconomy of things. They are purely monumental, set up to commemorate\\nsomething or somebody, but in no way to help on men's daily affairs,\\npublic or private. And yet they are not mere monuments, like a statue\\nor an inscribed stone. A large building of this kind, having very\\nmuch the air of a building which does serve some purpose, is a little\\ndeceptive. It is so like a real gateway that it calls up the thought\\nof a real gateway, and leaves us a little disappointed at finding that\\nthe building, after all, never was of any use to anybody, and was set\\nup simply to be looked at. There is, therefore, something a little\\nunsatisfactory in the whole class of triumphal arches, and it may even\\nbe that a slightly ludicrous element is thrown in when we find that the\\nimmediate occasion for rearing this record of the life and exploits\\nof the \\\"fortissimus princeps\\\" whom it commemorates was the repair of\\nthe Appian Way. But it does not become us to find fault with any built\\nand graven monument, specially with one of a time of which we have so\\nfew written monuments as the memorable reign of Trajan. We are so much\\nthe slaves of accidental associations, so apt to draw lines at some\\naltogether unreasonable point, that we may doubt whether the reign of\\nTrajan holds the place which it should hold in popular imagination.\\nSuetonius wrote the lives of Twelve C\\u00e6sars, and this mere accident has\\ncaused the notion of a break which has no real existence between the\\nSuetonian Twelve and those who next followed them. The reign of Trajan\\nmarks the Empire at its highest pitch of extent and power, at that\\nhighest pitch which, in its own nature, comes just before the beginning\\nof decay. His days saw, too, the highest pitch of architectural\\nmagnificence; and with Tacitus and Juvenal to adorn it, one might be\\ninclined to say that, as an age of Latin literature, the age of Trajan\\nmight hold its own against any earlier period of the Imperial rule. For\\nwe must remember that the great writers of the early days of Augustus\\nare in truth writers of the republican period living on into the\\nEmpire. The Flavian period, continued under Trajan, is quite as rich as\\nthe earlier days of the Empire itself. And we may notice that the arch\\nof Beneventum marks the reign of Trajan, and with it the Roman Empire,\\nat what was really its highest point. It was raised at a time when it\\ncould commemorate conquered Dacia and tributary Armenia. That Dacia and\\nArmenia could be brought within the range of that Roman world which is\\ncontinued in the system of modern Europe is proved by daily witnesses.\\nBut the arch of Beneventum was built too early to commemorate its\\nhero's later victories in the further East, momentary victories in\\nlands which neither Alexander nor Trajan could bring within the abiding\\nrange of Western influences.\\n\\nThe arch of Trajan is so distinctly the most famous thing in Benevento\\nthat it has carried us out of all chronological order. But the\\nhistorical interest of Beneventum lies earlier and later than Trajan's\\nday. In truth the Pax Romana forbade that the main interest of any\\nItalian city should lie in Trajan's day. We may believe or not as\\nwe please in the presence of Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas and \\u00c6neas; but Pyrrhos, Hanno,\\nTotilas, and Manfred are visitors who cannot be forgotten. The city\\nhas looked out on many battles, from the overthrow of the Molossian\\nto the overthrow of the Swabian. A pleasing tale in its history is\\nwhen that Tiberius Gracchus who is the first of a name to appear in\\nRoman history led back his victorious slave-soldiers to receive the\\nreward of freedom, and to be welcomed by the rejoicing people of the\\nfaithful colony. For among the Thirty Cities of those days, the Latin\\ncolony of Beneventum was not one of the laggard twelve, but one of\\nthe faithful eighteen that were ready to endure all hardships. In\\nlater warfare the city seems to have been less steadfast. It welcomed\\nBelisarius, and in after days Totilas took it without any trouble, and\\nif he destroyed the walls it was not out of revenge for any resistance\\non the part of its inhabitants, but for fear they should supply a post\\nof defence for an imperial army. But the greatest day of Beneventum as\\nan historical city comes later than Totilas and earlier than Manfred.\\nThe memory of that day may be studied in the chief remaining buildings\\nin the city, the two greatest churches and the castle. The west front\\nof the metropolitan church, a grand example of Italian Romanesque, is\\nfurthermore a perfect chronicle of local history. There we may read,\\nbuilt up into the wall, a crowd of monumental records of the Lombard\\nprinces of Beneventum, with their deeds, especially their dealings\\nwith the dangerous power of the Franks, set forth at length. The\\nbronze doors are famous, with their long array of Scriptural subjects\\nending in a lesson in the ecclesiastical geography of the province,\\nthe figures of the Archbishop of Beneventum and his suffragans. The\\nharmony of the front is a little marred by the single low and massive\\ncorner-tower; but the inscription sums up the history of Beneventum,\\npolitical and physical, for some ages. The city was laid waste by the\\nEmperor Frederick in 1229 and by an earthquake in 1688. The tower was\\nbuilt after the first overthrow in 1279; it was restored after the\\nsecond in 1690. Destruction wrought by the elements would thus seem\\nto be more easily repaired than destruction wrought by the hand of\\nC\\u00e6sar. But it is somewhat strange to find Frederick, in his own belief\\na successor of Trajan, a follower of Trajan in Eastern conquests,\\nbranded as a destroyer in the city where Trajan's memory is cherished.\\nBut Frederick had to deal with a kind of power which Trajan knew not.\\nThe wrath of the later Emperor fell on a city which was too faithful\\nto the Roman Bishop. The course of Trajan's rule was not likely to be\\ninterfered with either by the obscure chief of the persecuted Christian\\nsect, or by any minister of the creed of which Trajan was himself chief\\nPontiff.\\n\\nWithin the church the repairs done after the earthquake have wrought a\\ngood deal of mischief. But we can still see the four ranges of columns\\nof a mighty basilica which must once have taken its place among the\\nnoblest of its class. Their capitals are a little nondescript; but\\nthey do not offend the eye; if they were certified to be of Trajan's\\nday, it would doubtless be the right thing to admire them. The ambones\\nand the Easter-light are lovely work of the early fourteenth century,\\nthe days of a real Renaissance , truer than that which followed. The\\ntreasury is rich in vestments and other precious things; but the reader\\nof Anselm's Life looks in vain for that specially gorgeous vestment\\nwhich a Beneventan Archbishop of the eleventh century bore away from\\nCanterbury in exchange for the arm of St. Bartholomew, and which made\\nits wearer the most splendid object among the assembled fathers at\\nBari. If this missing garment carries our thoughts to England, the\\nround church of St. Sophia -- hexagonal in its inner range -- carries us\\nto the Eastern world, and reminds us that there was more than one line\\nof successors of Trajan, and that Beneventum came under the influences\\nof both. The cloister, with its amazing series of capitals, its birds,\\nits elephants, its hunting scenes, may rank with those of Aosta and of\\nArles, of which that of Aosta can supply camels to match the Beneventan\\nelephants. The castle dates only from Pope John the Twenty-second, far\\naway at Avignon; we look perhaps more carefully at the older fragments\\nbuilt up in its walls and on the lion in front of it. With the lion\\nin our thoughts we may look out for other beasts, graven or molten\\nor abiding in their own relics. Procopius saw there the tusks of the\\nKalydonian boar, as in later times he might, either at Warwick or at\\nBristol, have seen the ribs of the dun cow. It is for pal\\u00e6ontologists\\nto say what it was that the Beneventan antiquaries really showed\\nhim. Failing this natural wonder we go to pay our respects to another\\nbeast whose shape is due to man's device, in quite another part of the\\ncity. A rudely carved bovine animal, in which local patriotism sees\\nthe Samnite bull -- the bull which, on the coins of revived Samnium, so\\nproudly trampled down the Roman wolf -- is now cruelly to be ruled as\\nnothing better than a monument of intruding Apis-worship. We have less\\ntime to spend at Benevento than at some other cities; but the Roman\\narches and vaults of the strange building called Quaranta Santi ,\\nthe grand Roman bridge below, must not be forgotten, and we must still\\ngive one more thought to the two mighty men whose hopes were shattered\\nat Beneventum. Manfred fell with his faithful Saracens around him;\\nPyrrhos lived to fall by a meaner end at Argos; but Beneventum ended\\nthe real career of both. It is strange how the two were in some sort\\nthe converse of each other. Pyrrhos carried the Epeirot arms into\\nSicily and southern Italy; Manfred, lord of Sicily and southern Italy,\\nestablished a Sicilian dominion on the coast of Epeiros. Korkyra,\\nCorfu, the island which has seen every master except the Turk, formed\\npart of the dominions of both alike. We leave Benevento for another\\ncity in which the East and the West of Europe, and a crowd of other\\nelements besides, meet yet more closely than they do at Benevento.\\nAt Beneventum the eye of Horace began to be caught by the well-known\\nmountains of Apulia; Procopius somewhat boldly speaks of inland\\nBeneventum as being opposite to Dalmatia. The city which we take as\\nour next chief goal, if not strictly opposite to Dalmatia, is so marked\\nas being opposite to one Illyrian port as to have sent its name, so to\\nspeak, across the Hadriatic. We will not trouble ourselves to look out\\nfor Equotuticum, or to regale ourselves with either the bread or the\\nwater of Canusium. It is to the walls of Bari, fishy Bari, that we have\\nto make our way; at Bari, Greek, Latin, Saracen, even Englishman, are\\nall at home, and Bari is opposite to Antivari.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Norman Buildings in Apulia.\\n\\n\\nAt Foggia the line of railway which crosses the Italian peninsula\\nfrom Naples eastward joins the great European line which for the most\\npart skirts the Western Hadriatic shore. From Rome itself the iter\\nad Brundisium is still made by way of Beneventum; for the great mass\\nof mankind Bologna has in this matter supplanted Beneventum and Rome\\ntoo. Our eastward course across the peninsula has done for us much the\\nsame as would be done by the like course across our own island. We have\\nundergone the same change as if we had passed from Wales, Devonshire,\\nor Cumberland, to Lincolnshire or East-Anglia. We need no longer\\nlook out for hill-cities, where the first element in such cities, the\\nhills themselves, is not to be found. At Foggia we have not even the\\namount of hill which we have at Benevento. We are in the great Apulian\\nplain, the plain so precious for sheep-feeding, and the occupation of\\nwhich has more than once given rise to wars and treaties. Of Foggia\\nitself many perhaps have never heard except as a railway junction.\\nYet Foggia has a history, and its history has monuments, though we\\ncan hardly put them on a level with the monuments and the history of\\nBeneventum. The capital of Apulia, the representative of ancient Arpi,\\nhas a history in some respects the same as that of Beneventum, in some\\nother respects its opposite. Both cities claimed Diom\\u00ead\\u00eas as a founder,\\nwhile Frederick the Second, a destroyer at Benevento, appears as a\\nlater founder at Foggia. One arch of his palace still remains, with an\\ninscription telling us how under him Foggia became a royal and Imperial\\nseat. There died his English Empress Isabel, on the splendour of whose\\npassage on her way to her marriage our own historians are eloquent.\\nFurther than this, the monumental attractions of Foggia hardly go\\nbeyond what is left of its chief church. Of its front Gsell-fels, gives\\na somewhat ideal engraving, showing it, not as it is, but as it was\\nbefore earthquakes and restorers after earthquakes had combined to mar\\nit. It was -- indeed, with all mutilations, it still is -- a fine front\\nof the later Italian Romanesque, with one of the rose or wheel windows\\nwhich we must now look for wherever we go. More attractive perhaps is\\nthe crypt, with its four columns and capitals of singular beauty. They\\nsurely belong to the time of the Imperial patron of Foggia, marking as\\nthey do a kind of earlier and more healthy Renaissance , which, taking\\nclassical form as its general models, took them only as general models,\\nand did not deem itself bound slavishly to copy every turn of a leaf\\nor every section of a moulding. Such works of the carver's tool are\\nakin to those noble coins of Frederick which seem ages in advance of\\nanything that bore the image and superscription of his grandfather.\\n\\nFoggia is however less likely to strike the traveller -- at least\\nthe traveller who comes from the hill-towns by way of Capua and\\nBenevento -- by any remarkable store of ancient monuments, than as\\nbeing the first to which he will come of a series of cities, most of\\nwhich at once impress the visitor by their air of modern progress and\\nprosperity. The heel of Italy, in its cities at least, certainly seems\\nto be the very opposite to a decaying region, or even to a region which\\nstands still. To be sure, the city whose name is the most familiar\\nof all is something of an exception; Brindisi, notwithstanding its\\ndealings with the whole world, is not as Bari or even as Trani. But\\nmost of the towns at which we tarry, or which we pass by, give quite a\\ndifferent impression. We cannot tarry at all. At Barletta we get only\\na glimpse of the Imperial colossus, and therefore we do not venture\\nto hazard a guess whether it is Heraclius or any later prince whom it\\nrepresents. Along this coast, any C\\u00e6sar of the East is in his place,\\nif only as a memorial of the long, though half forgotten, time when\\nSouthern Italy bowed to the New Rome and not to the Old. But we do\\nnot let these earlier memories wholly shut out the thought of the\\nlater combat when the Horatii and Curiatii of legend found themselves\\nmultiplied by a process exactly opposite to decimation. The attractions\\nof Trani are irresistible; a bell-tower rising as proudly over the\\nwaves as that of Spalato itself would force us to halt even if we knew\\nnothing before of what church and city has to show us. The metropolitan\\nchurch of Trani is certainly one of the very noblest examples of that\\nsingular mixture of Norman and more strictly Italian forms -- not without\\na touch both of the Greek and the Saracen -- which is the characteristic\\nstyle of this region, the natural result of its political history.\\nStrange, but striking in the extreme, is the effect of the east end\\nof this church rising close above the sea; far more truly admirable\\nis the effect of the inside, where the coupled columns of the Saracen\\nhave been boldly taught to act as the piers of the great arcades,\\nand to bear up above them a massive triforium, which by itself would\\nmake us think ourselves in Normandy or England. All the churches of\\nthis district have a good deal of their strength underground, and the\\nunder-church of Trani is worthy of the building which it supports.\\nThe smaller church, All Saints', a charming little basilica with a\\nportico of singular grace, as also several good pieces of domestic\\narchitecture, and the general effect of the tower skirted with its\\ndark arcades, all join to make Trani a place which cannot be passed\\nby, though no august form calls on us, as at Barletta, to tarry to\\npay C\\u00e6sar his due homage. But Trani has found something to be said for\\nitself both by pen and by pencil in quite other company. An accident of\\nlater times gave it a right to rank, like Brindisi itself, among the\\nSubject and Neighbour Lands of Venice. And Trani has peculiarities of\\nits own. The main features of the style may be studied elsewhere. We\\nlong to see Barletta, to tarry to pay C\\u00e6sar his due. We long to stop at\\nBisceglia and Molfetta, of which we read attractive notices; but again\\nwe must pick and choose, and Bitonto is the only place on which we can\\nqualify ourselves to speak at all at large, till we come to the head of\\nthe whole region at Bari.\\n\\nBitonto shares a station with San Spirito, but it lies further away\\nfrom the railway, and that on the inland side, than most of the towns\\nalong this line. Its main interest is found in its cathedral church,\\nwhich in some points prepares us for the buildings of Bari. First\\nof all in point of wonder, though latest in point of date, is the\\ntreatment which it has undergone at the hands of modern improvers.\\nA dim remembrance comes to us that we saw something of the same kind\\nin the Dominican church at Perugia; otherwise we ask in amazement why\\nany man should think it an improvement to cut off the whole upper part\\nof a church as seen inside by thrusting in a roof a great deal lower\\nthan the original one, and thereby leaving the upper stages outside\\nto stand up in the air, serving no kind of purpose. Yet this has been\\ndone both at Bitonto and at Bari. Yet perchance the improvers of modern\\ntimes might retort on the original architects, and ask why, when they\\nhad made three apses at the east end, they presently built up a wall\\nto hide them. This is the arrangement both at Bitonto and in the two\\ngreat churches of Bari. The notion of Normans working in Italy would\\nalmost seem to have been to make an Italian front at one end, and\\nsomething approaching to a Norman front at the other end. Thus the\\nchurch of Bitonto has an excellent west front of Italian outline, with\\ndetails more Italian than Norman, and with the characteristic round\\nwindow evidently designed from the beginning, though the one which is\\nactually there must be of later date. Also there either has been or has\\nbeen meant to be a portico over the lower stage of the west front, a\\nthoroughly Italian notion. But the east end takes almost the form of\\na Norman west front; a Norman founder, it would seem, was not happy\\nunless he could somewhere or other get two towers with an ornamental\\nwall between them. To this end the apses are sacrificed. Instead of\\nthe three curved projections which form the main features of so many\\nItalian, German, and indeed Norman, east ends, the whole east end is\\nflat. The side apses are disguised by towers, one only of which is\\ncarried up to any height, while the great apse is hidden by the wall\\nbetween the towers. Herein is the difference between Bitonto and Trani.\\nAt Trani there are no eastern towers, and the apses, though of amazing\\nexternal height and no less amazing slightness of projection, are still\\nreal apses with a real curve. At Bitonto no one could know from the\\noutside that there were any apses at all. As the ordinary ranges of\\narcades and windows are thus made impossible, the architect, like an\\nEnglish architect some generations later, threw his strength into a\\nsingle east window, and certainly made one as large and as rich as was\\npossible before the invention of tracery. An elaborate round-headed\\nopening is covered with rich devices, and has wonderful monsters to\\nbear up its side-shafts. This too is to be seen at Trani, and we shall\\ncome again to other examples at Bari. There is something very strange\\nin these attempts to reconcile the ideas of Normandy and of Italy in\\none building. But in these flat east ends the result is that we get\\nsomething which is certainly neither Italian nor Norman, and which can\\nhardly be approved according to any law of either reality or beauty.\\n\\nThe same spirit of compromise goes on in other parts. The endless\\ncolumns of the under-church supply a rich study of capitals, largely of\\nthe grotesque kind. Men, monkeys, the original ram's horn, leaves, the\\nImperial eagle -- better suited for the purpose than anything else -- all\\ndo duty as volutes. The columns in the upper-church too give another\\nrich collection of various kinds of human, animal, and vegetable forms.\\nBut here a soberer spirit reigns; though perhaps no one capital is\\nstrictly classical, yet the grotesque does not reign as it does below.\\nThree arches from columns, a solid block, three more arches from\\ncolumns, make up the nave. Over these Italian elements Norman taste\\nset a triforium; modern taste has hidden the clerestory. Outside, the\\nItalian has his way in the rich open arcades of the parapets and in\\nthe windows of various forms, filled, some of them, with that kind of\\npierced tracery which is neither Italian nor Norman, but distinctively\\nOriental, and which look as if they had come -- as they possibly may have\\ncome -- from a mosque.\\n\\nAltogether there is something singularly interesting in this mixture of\\nstyles -- more strictly this mixture of two varieties of the same style,\\nfor Italian and Norman Romanesque are after all members of one great\\nartistic family. Nothing of the kind happened in Sicily, where the\\nNorman kings simply set native craftsmen, Greek and Saracen, to build\\nfor them after their several native fashions. Here, in a land where\\nGreek and Latin elements were striving for mastery, where the Saracen\\nwas a mere occasional visitor, the Norman brought in the ideas of his\\nown land to make a new element. But, if nothing like this happened in\\nSicily, something a little like it did happen in England. There is no\\ndoubt that Norman architecture was influenced, though very slightly,\\nby the earlier native style of England, a rude imitation of Italian\\nmodels. That Norman architecture in Apulia should be far more deeply\\ninfluenced by the Italian models themselves was but carrying out the\\nsame general process, as was only natural, in a far greater degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Bari.\\n\\n\\nWe are now at Barium, Bari, the original Bari of the West, as\\ndistinguished from the Bari, Bar , Antibaris , Antivari , which\\nrepeats its name on the opposite coast. There we can now again, as we\\ncould have done seventy years back at Cattaro, land at a Montenegrin\\nhaven. The distinction between the two bearers of the name of Bari\\nimplies an association which is not out of place. The historic interest\\nof Bari gathers wholly round its connexion with the lands on the\\nother side of Hadria. In earlier days the place has really no history\\nwhatever. Its most memorable day was when the powers of the Eastern\\nand Western Empires -- powers which perhaps never again worked in such\\nharmony -- were needed to dislodge a Saracen Sultan from its walls.\\n\\\"Emir,\\\" some one will say, not \\\"Sultan,\\\" and certainly we are more\\nused in Europe to Sultans of much later date than the days of Lewis\\nthe Second and Basil the First, Sultans coming from quite other lands\\nthan any that can have sent forth the Mussulman prince of Bari. But\\nhe is called Sultan as well as Emir by his one biographer, the Emperor\\nConstantine, and we cannot appeal from those august pages which still\\nform the best guide-book to the eastern shores of the Hadriatic.\\nAnyhow, the Sultan of Bari was a philosopher; he never laughed, except\\nonce when he saw a wheel go round; for that reminded him of the ups and\\ndowns of his own fortunes. Then Bari passes to the rule of the Eastern\\nEmpire; instead of a Sultan it has a Katapan, representative of the\\nEastern Augustus in that Italian dominion which had become so small\\nat the beginning of the ninth century, and which was so great again at\\nits end. Threatened again at the beginning of the eleventh century by\\nnew Saracen invaders, it is guarded by the fleets of Venice, still the\\nfaithful vassal of Constantinople against a common enemy. Seventy years\\nlater the arms of Robert Wiscard added the capital of Byzantine Italy\\nto his Norman dominion, and before the century was out, Pope Urban, the\\ngreat stirrer of the West against the Mussulman East, chose Bari as the\\nscene of the Council called to denounce at once the practical abuses of\\nthe Christian West and the dogmatic errors of the Christian East. Once\\nmore, in the next age, we find Bari looking across the sea to its old\\nlord, and chastised by the Sicilian king for its disloyalty. Add that\\nBari, before all saints, still honours St. Nicolas of the Lykian Myra,\\nand keeps his relics sacred, we are told, from Turkish desecration\\nby the craft of merchants of her own city. Altogether Bari seems, at\\nleast in its history, as much Greek as Italian or Norman. It would seem\\nneither unnatural nor unpleasant if Greek were still the tongue of the\\nseafaring folk of Bari, much as a Norman in his own land often carries\\nan air about him which would make Danish seem a much more natural\\nspeech for him than French.\\n\\nBut the great buildings of Bari belong to that mixed Norman and\\nItalian style of which we have already seen something at Bitonto. The\\narchitectural attractions of the city are chiefly to be found in two\\ngreat churches and one smaller one. The castle, standing by the sea,\\nshould have its landward side walked round, and the walk will reveal\\nmuch of picturesque outline and a little of good detail. But it is\\nthe churches, above all the great abbey of St. Nicolas, which are the\\nglory of Bari. They all lie in the old town by the sea, the old town\\nof narrow and crooked streets, in which it does not much matter which\\nway you go; you are sure to come either to the castle or to one of the\\nchurches before very long. Very different are things in the new town,\\nwhich we may rejoice in as we look at it as a sign of Bari's abiding\\nor renewed prosperity, but which can raise no feelings of pleasure on\\nany other ground. Its streets, crossing each other at right angles, are\\nindeed carefully dedicated to the worthies of Bari; but, unless we can\\nalways remember which of several perhaps not very familiar worthies\\nwatches over each of several angles which are exactly alike, it is\\neasy to take a wrong turn and to put oneself under the care of Andrew\\nof Bari when we ought rather to be commending ourselves to Robert.\\nAnd under either protection we yearn in the wide straight streets\\nfor some physical shelter from the Apulian sun, and wonder why modern\\nRome, modern Athens, and modern Bari should have so much less common\\nsense than Bologna, Padua, and Corfu had in days long past. Still,\\namid this rectangular labyrinth the sea is a help on one side, while\\non another the tall tower of the metropolitan church of St. Sabinus\\nbeckons us into the older streets, whose narrowness and crookedness\\nat least supply shade. That tower, one of the tallest and stateliest\\nof Italy, we naturally assume to be a detached campanile, without a\\nfellow and standing apart from its confederate buildings, church and\\nbaptistery. So it doubtless would be in a purely Italian city; but\\nhere we are in the city where the Norman displaced the Greek. The\\ntwo great churches of Bari, like that of Bitonto, have their towers\\nwrought into the building in Norman fashion, and at the duomo the\\ngreat round baptistery is also merged in the same mass with the church\\nand its towers. Both of the great churches of Bari have east ends\\nof the same kind as that at Bitonto; the apses are swallowed up; the\\nplace where the great apse should be is marked by a single splendid\\nRomanesque window. The eastern towers of St. Nicolas have never been\\ncarried up; at St. Sabinus the southern one has perished, but the\\nnorthern one still soars in all its majesty, thoroughly Italian in its\\nconception, but rather to be called Norman in its detail. St. Nicolas\\nhas also another pair of unfinished towers at its west end, standing\\nat once beyond the aisles as at Wells and Rouen, and in front of them\\nas at Holyrood. They flank a grand Italian front which one would think\\nwould be finer without them. These western towers are absent in the\\nmetropolitan church; but that has a most perfect octagonal cupola\\nover the crossing, the grouping of which with the two lofty eastern\\ntowers, if there was any point from which it could really be seen,\\nmust have been wonderful. Thus, in both churches, something of a German\\noutline has either been consciously brought in or has been incidentally\\nstumbled on. The four towers of St. Nicolas, the octagon and eastern\\ntower of St. Sabinus, will easily find Rhenish fellows, though we\\nshould perhaps have to go as far as Angoul\\u00eame for a single tower of\\nequal majesty mourning over a vanished brother. In other points the\\nexternal arrangements of the two great churches of Bari have much\\nin common. The rose windows, the coupled windows, the blank arcades,\\nare much the same in both. So is the choice of animal forms for the\\nfanciful supports of columns. In most places the lion discharges that\\nfunction -- in a building designed by lions we should doubtless see\\nsomething different. So we do here at Bari, where the solid forms of\\nthe pachydermata are, perhaps discreetly, preferred to the lighter\\n carnivora . The elephant, we think, is to be found in both churches,\\nand the huge earth-shaking beast is represented so as to remind us both\\nof Pyrrhos and of Hannibal; some have the smaller ear of India, some\\nthe larger of Africa. The hippopotamus appears only in the west front\\nof St. Nicolas. Had the daring shipfolk who bore away the saint's bones\\nfrom Lykia made their way to the Nile also?\\n\\nWhen we pass the threshold of the two buildings we see that their fate\\nin modern times has been very different. St. Sabinus has suffered much\\nas Bitonto has suffered. The upper part of the building is hidden\\nin just the same fashion, and ugly tricks have been played with the\\ncolumns and their capitals. St. Nicolas, on the other hand, has been\\nleft comparatively alone. The chief changes which it has undergone\\nmust have taken place not very long after the original building. The\\noriginal plan was much the same as that of Bitonto -- three arches from\\ncolumns, a massive pier, then three more arches from columns. But this\\narrangement was disturbed at an early time by throwing three spanning\\narches across the nave. The effect is so striking that we can hardly\\nregret their presence; but it is perfectly easy to see that they are\\ninsertions, and, though they are essentially of the same style, yet\\nthey differ in their details from the original columns. These last all\\napproach more or less to the Corinthian type; in the under-church the\\npatterns are more varied. Here are still the wonder-working relics of\\nSt. Nicolas, and the balsam or \\\"manna\\\" which flows from them may still\\nbe drunk. In the duomo the under-church has been restored out of all\\nancient character, but it still keeps an ancient Byzantine picture.\\n\\nAs so often happens, the secondary church of Bari altogether surpassed\\nthe mother church in historic fame and local honour. To ourselves the\\nfact in its history which comes home most nearly is that it was here\\nthat Urban held his Council, here that Anselm, to the satisfaction\\nof all Western minds, refuted the creed of the East, here that he\\ninterceded with the Pontiff and the assembled fathers on behalf of the\\nking who had wronged him. Here too it was that the keen eye of English\\nEadmer spied out on the shoulders of the Archbishop of Beneventum the\\nsplendid cope which is no longer to be seen at Beneventum. Such little\\ntouches in those days often brought the ends of the world together\\nin a way to which, in our days of more general intercourse, nothing\\nanswers. When French was the polite language alike at Dunfermline and\\nat Jerusalem, when the Latin-speaking clerk was at home in any corner\\nof the West, when the few men of the West who had learned Greek spoke\\nit so that a Greek could understand them, when men passed to and fro\\nbetween the civil services of England and Sicily, communication between\\ndistant parts of Europe was in some ways easier than it is now. Bari,\\none of the chief places for setting out on crusades, must for a long\\ntime have been a thoroughly cosmopolitan city. We do feel that the ends\\nof the earth have combined to meet at Bari, when we find the place\\nof honour in the church of St. Nicolas at Bari held by a princess of\\nBari, who became Queen of the greatest Slavonic kingdom. Emblematic\\nfigures of Bari and Poland support the tomb of Queen Bona, and her\\nepitaph describes her husband Sigismund, the first of that name, as not\\nonly the mighty King of Poland, but Grand-Duke of Lithuania, Russia,\\nPrussia, Mazovia, and Samogitia. Yet we might have lighted on Slavonic\\nassociations earlier on the road. There is a strange record of a\\nBulgarian settlement in the parts of Beneventum; but that would take us\\nyet further afield: it was before Bulgarians became Slavonic. But what\\nare we to say to the Samnite Schiavia which sheltered Anselm?\\n\\nThe journey is done -- \\n\\n\\\"Brundisium long\\u00e6 finis cart\\u00e6que vi\\u00e6que.\\\"\\n\\nOtranto lies yet further; but Otranto, yet more notably than Bari,\\ncomes within the Venetian Notitia . So does Brundisium, city of the\\nstag's horn, of the haven so aptly called, if we only knew in what\\ntongue it is that Brentesium has that meaning. But we are tempted\\nto regret that Brindisi and not Otranto is the point for which Hadria\\nhas to be crossed. Brindisi has no moral claim. We cannot look thence,\\nas we can from Otranto, upon the mountains of still enslaved Epeiros;\\nno one is tempted even to dream that he looks on free Corfu or on the\\nlesser satellite that stands in front as its outpost.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"But if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place\\nwhere they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they\\nspeak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in\\nthe state in which the first artist set them!

The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is\\nwell to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a\\nroundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and\\never-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns\\nof Assisi, Spello, and a third further on -- can it be distant Trevi?\\nFoligno lies down in the plain -- each seated on its hill. The tomb is\\nreached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each\\nside of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of\\nputting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places\\nin the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined\\nto find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so\\nhappily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed\\nif a few things are put inside which had better have been left\\noutside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance -- moved doubtless\\nonly when another member of the house was literally gathered to his\\nfathers -- stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old\\nplace now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes\\nlead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres\\nat Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished\\nin their own way at Myk\\u00ean\\u00ea. But those were built, piled up of stones;\\nhere the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.\\nThe top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the\\nforms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface\\nare carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.\\nNor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of\\nthe dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the\\nopen door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and\\nlights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light\\nup the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,\\nfronting us as we enter, lies on his kistwaen -- may we transfer\\nthe barbarian name to so delicate a work of art? -- the father of the\\nhousehold gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the\\nfirst Felimna , but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name\\nof the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting\\nany special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from\\nright to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the\\npatriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the\\nmost speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be\\neasily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite\\nto it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is\\nno figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of\\nthose sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.\\nThe legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it\\nare those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was\\nthe father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century\\nbefore our \\u00e6ra, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,\\nand when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and\\nVolumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special\\nforce. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land\\nunder Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son\\nof Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and\\na crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NER_results\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Perhaps, on the\\nwhole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the\\npublic palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy\\nsatellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of\\nsculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty\\nbut shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.\\nAnd at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;\\nthe remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must\\nseek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and\\nstand on the bridge which spans the Via Appia of Perugia, a strange\\nnamesake for the Via Appia of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan\\ncity, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one\\nof the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect\\nfrom the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a\\nkind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.\\nFrom this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the\\nwalls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something\\nthat Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the\\nolder and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly\\nknown as Via Vecchia . At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the\\nthought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the manes of\\nhis uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes\\nno answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations\\nof the Etruscan, save that the legend of \\\"Augusta Perusia\\\" is itself a\\nrecord of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,\\nthe Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast\\nindeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of\\nAutun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the\\nolder work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in\\ncommon with the endless medi\\u00e6val gateways and arches which span the\\nstreets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a\\nless favourable position, is the other gateway, the Porta Martis ,\\nwhich now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once\\ndid of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find\\nout, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at\\nleast two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.\\n\\nThe walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,\\nbut they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within\\nthe shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,\\nchurch, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,\\nwould have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like\\nBologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,\\nPerugia once had streets after streets -- the small and narrow streets\\nnot the least conspicuously -- of a thoroughly good and simple style of\\nstreet architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they\\nare quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,\\nsome of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly\\nthe best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the\\nPerugian houses. As in England medi\\u00e6val houses are spoiled to make\\nbigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.\\nMost of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an\\nugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which\\nis destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of\\nbeauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats\\nall other nations in carrying out his object.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Roman colony\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"location\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch\\'s \"Life of Timole√¥n,\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost pr√¶historic day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmedi√¶val times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.>>>\\n\\nAnswer: {{{{\\'person\\': [\\'Plutarch\\', \\'Victor Emmanuel\\', \\'Pope Paul\\', \\'Augustus\\'],\\n     \\'location\\': [\\'Perugia\\', \\'Cortona\\', \\'Venice\\', \\'Genoa\\', \\'Florence\\', \\'Naples\\', \\'Milan\\', \\'Pisa\\', \\'Rome\\', \\'Italy\\', \\'Etruscan Perusia\\', \\'Roman Augusta Perusia\\'],}}}} '"
