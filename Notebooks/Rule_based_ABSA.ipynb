        "# Rule-based aspect-based sentiment analysis for English 😥😀\n",
        "\n",
        "This Notebook shows you how to perform ABSA on an English corpus through a rule- and lexicon-based approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "We do this through the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Extract nouns as aspects using [spaCy's POS-tagger](https://spacy.io/) after cleaning steps such as lemmatizing and removing stopwords.\n",
        "2.   Extract adjectives, coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions as opinion words using spaCy's POS-tagger.\n",
        "3.   Apply [SenticNet](https://sentic.net/) on the opinion words to find a sentiment score for the opinion words, and [NLTK's SynSet](https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html) to transform negated opinion words into their antonym, and calculate the opninion score based on this antonym. We know the texts we are working with include both Italian words and English words, so we first search for the opinion word in the English SenticNet, and if it is not found we look for it in [BabelSenticNet](https://sentic.net/babelsenticnet.pdf) (multilingual version which includes Italian).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Notebook also shows you how to create IOB-labels for the results, and evaluate the extracted spans quantitatively using [Nervaluate](https://pypi.org/project/nervaluate/).\n",
        "\n",
        "❗🧠 This notebook does **not** show you how to add categories to the aspects. It simply defines aspects through their syntactical function.\n",

UP AND DOWN MADEIRA.\\n\\nNo drop-curtain, at any theatre I have seen, was ever so richly imagined, with misty tops and shadowy clefts and frowning cliffs and gloomy valleys and long, plunging cataracts, as the actual landscape of Madeira, when we drew nearer and nearer to it, at the close of a tearful afternoon of mid-January. The scenery of drop-curtains is often very boldly beautiful, but here Nature, if she had taken a hint from art, had certainly bettered her instruction. During the waits between acts at the theatre, while studying the magnificent painting beyond the trouble of the orchestra, I have been most impressed by the splendid variety which the artist had got into his picture, where the spacious frame lent itself to his passion for saying everything; but I remembered his thronging fancies as meagre and scanty in the presence of the stupendous reality before me. I have, for instance, not even mentioned the sea, which swept smoother and smoother in toward the feet of those precipices and grew more and more trans-lucently purple and yellow and green, while half a score of cascades shot straight down their fronts in shafts of snowy foam, and over their pachydermatous shoulders streamed and hung long reaches of gray vines or mosses. To the view from the sea the island is all, with its changing capes and promontories and bays and inlets, one immeasurable mountain; and on the afternoon of our approach it was bestridden by a steadfast rainbow, of which we could only see one leg indeed, but that very stout and athletic.\\nThere were breadths of dark woodland aloft on this mountain, and terraced vineyards lower down; and on the shelving plateaus yet farther from the heights that lost themselves in the clouds there were scattered white cottages; on little levels close to the sea there were set white villas. These, as the ship coquetted with the vagaries of the shore, thickened more and more, until after rounding a prodigious headland we found ourselves in face of the charming little city of Funchal: long horizontal lines of red roofs, ivory and pink and salmon walls, evenly fenestrated, with an ancient fortress giving the modern look of things a proper mediaeval touch. Large hotels, with the air of palaces, crowned the upland vantages; there were bell-towers of churches, and in one place there was a wide splotch of vivid color from the red of the densely flowering creeper on the side of some favored house. There was an acceptable expanse of warm brown near the quay from the withered but unfailing leaves of a sycamore-shaded promenade, and in the fine roadstead where we anchored there lay other steamers and a lead-colored Portuguese war-ship. I am not a painter, but I think that here are the materials of a water-color which almost any one else could paint. In the hands of a scene-painter they would yield a really unrivalled drop-curtain. I stick to the notion of this because when the beautiful goes too far, as it certainly does at Madeira, it leaves you not only sated but vindictive; you wish to mock it.\\nThe afternoon saddened more and more, and one could not take an interest in the islanders who came out in little cockles and proposed to dive for shillings and sixpences, though quarters and dimes would do. The company\\u2019s tender also came out, and numbers of passengers went ashore in the mere wantonness of paying for their dinner and a night\\u2019s lodging in the annexes of the hotels, which they were told beforehand were full. The lights began to twinkle from the windows of the town, and the dark fell upon the insupportable picturesqueness of the prospect, leaving one to a gayety of trooping and climbing lamps which defined the course of the streets.\\nThe morning broke in sunshine, and after early breakfast the launches began to ply again between the ship and the shore and continued till nearly all the first and second cabin people had been carried off. The people of the steerage satisfied what longing they had for strange sights and scenes by thronging to the sides of the steamer until they gave her a strong list landward, as they easily might, for there were twenty-five hundred of them. At Madeira there is a local Thomas Cook & Son of quite another name, but we were not finally sure that the alert youth on the pier who sold us transportation and provision was really their agent. However, his tickets served perfectly well at all points, and he was of such an engaging civility and personal comeliness that I should not have much minded their failing us here and there. He gave the first charming-touch of the Latin south whose renewed contact is such a pleasure to any one knowing it from the past. All Portuguese as Funchal was, it looked so like a hundred little Italian towns that it seemed to me as if I must always have driven about them in calico-tented bullock-carts set on runners, as later I drove about Eunchal.\\nIt was warm enough on the ship, but here in the town we found ourselves in weather that one could easily have taken for summer, if the inhabitants had not repeatedly assured us that it was the season of winter, and that there were no flowers and no fruits. They could not, if they had wished, have denied the flies; these, in a hotel interior to which we penetrated, simply swarmed. If it was winter in Funchal it was no wintrier than early autumn would have been in one of those Italian towns of other days; it had the same temperament, the same little tree-planted spaces, the same devious, cobble-paved streets, the same pleasant stucco houses; the churches had bells of like tone, and if their facades confessed a Spanish touch they were not more Spanish than half the churches in Naples. The public ways were of a scrupulous cleanliness, as if, with so many English signs glaring down at them, they durst not untidy out-of-doors, though in-doors it was said to be different with them. There are three thousand English living at Funchal and everybody speaks English, however slightly. The fresh faces of English girls met us in the streets and no doubt English invalids abound.\\nWe shipmates were all going to the station of the funicular railway, but our tickets did not call for bullock-sleds and so we took a clattering little horse-car, which climbed with us through up-hill streets and got us to the station too soon. Within the closed grille there the handsomest of swarthy, black-eyed, black-mustached station-masters (if such was his quality) told us that we could not have a train at once, though we had been advised that any ten of us could any time have a train, because the cars had all gone up the mountain and none would be down for twenty minutes. He spoke English and he mitigated by a most amiable personality sufferings which were perhaps not so great as we would have liked to think. Some of us wandered off down a pink-and-cream colored avenue near by and admired so much the curtains of red-and-yellow flowers\\u2014a cross between honeysuckles and trumpet blossoms\\u2014overhanging a garden-wall that two friendly boys began to share our interest in them. One of them mounted the other and tore down handfuls of the flowers, which they bestowed upon us with so little apparent expectation of reward that we promptly gave them of the international copper coinage current in Madeira, and went back to the station doubtless feeling guiltier than they. Had we not been accessory after the fact to something like theft and, as it was Sunday, to Sabbath-breaking besides? Afterward flowers proved so abundant in Madeira in spite of its being winter, that we could not feel the larceny a serious one, and the Sunday was a Latin Sabbath well used to being broken. The pony engine which was to push our slanting car over the cogged track up the mountain arrived with due ceremony of bell and whistle, and we were let through the grille by the station-master as politely as if we had been each his considered guest. Then the climb began through the fields of sugar-cane, terraced vineyards, orchards of fruit trees, and gardens of vegetables planted under the arbors over which the grapes were trained. One of us told the others that the vegetables were sheltered to save them from being scorched by the summer sun, and that much of the work among them was done by moonlight to save the laborers from the same fate. I do not know how he had amassed this knowledge, and I am not sure that I have the right to impart it without his leave. I myself saw some melons lolling on one of the tiled roofs of the cottages where they had perhaps been pushed by the energetic forces of the earth and sky. The grape-vines were quiescent, partly because it was winter, as everybody said, and partly because the wine culture is no longer so profitable in the island. It has been found for the moment that Madeira is bad for the gout, and this discovery of the doctors is bad for the peasants (already cruelly overtaxed by Portugal), who are leaving their homes in great numbers and seeking their fortunes in both of the Americas, as well as the islands of all the seas. It must be a heartbreak for them to forsake such homes as we saw in the clean white cottages, with the balconies and terraces.\\nBut there were no signs of depopulation either of old or young. Smiling mothers and fathers of all ages, in their Sunday leisure and their Sunday best, watched our ascent as if they had never seen the like before, and our course was never so swift but we could be easily overtaken by the children; they embarrassed us with the riches of the camellias which they flung in upon us, and they were accompanied by small dogs which barked excitedly. Our train almost grazed the walls of the door-yards as we passed through the succession of the one- and two-story cottages, which dotted the mountain-side in every direction. When the eye could leave them it was lured from height to height, and at each rise of the track to some wider and lovelier expanse of the sea. We could see merely our own steamer in the roadstead, with the Portuguese war-ship, and the few other vessels at anchor, but we could never exhaust the variety of those varied mountain slopes and tops. Their picturesqueness of form and their delight of color would beggar any thesaurus of its descriptive reserves, and yet leave their beauty almost unhinted. A drop-curtain were here a vain simile; the chromatic glories of colored postal-cards might suggest the scene, but then again they might overdo it. Nature is modest in her most magnificent moods, and I do not see how she could have a more magnificent mood than Madeira. It can never be represented by my art, but it may be measurably stated: low lying sea; the town scattering and fraying everywhere into outlying hamlets, villas and cottages; steep rising upon steep, till they reach uninhabitable climaxes where the woods darken upward into the everlasting snows, in one whole of grandeur resuming in its unity every varying detail.\\nI dwell rather helplessly upon the scenery, because it was what we professedly went up or half up, or one-tenth or-hundredth up, the mountain for. Un-professedly we went up in order to come down by the toboggan of the country, though we vowed one another not to attempt anything so mad. In the meanwhile, before it should be time for lunch, we could walk up to a small church near the station and see the people at prayer in an interior which did not differ in bareness and tawdriness from most other country churches of the Latin south, though it had a facade so satisfyingly Spanish, because I suppose it was so perfectly Portuguese, that heart could ask no more. Not all the people were at prayer within; irregular files of them attended our progress to give us the opportunity of doing charity. The beggars were of every sort, sex, and age, and some, from the hands they held out, with fingers reduced to their last joints, looked as if they might be lepers, but I do not say they were. What I am sure of is that the faces of the worshippers\\u2014men, women, and children\\u2014when they came out of the church were of a gentleness which, if it was not innocence and goodness, might well have passed for those virtues. They had kind eyes, which seemed as often blue as black, and if they had no great beauty they were seldom quite ugly. I wish I could think we strangers, as they gazed curiously, timorously at us, struck them as favorably.\\nAn involuntary ferocity from the famine which we began to feel may have glared from our visages, for we had eaten nothing for three hours, which was long for saloon passengers. At the first restaurant which we found, and in which we all but sat down at table, our coupons were not good, but this was not wholly loss, for we recouped ourselves in the beauties of the walk on which we wandered along the mountain-side to the right of the restaurant. At the point where we were no longer confident of our way an opportune native appeared and Jed us over paths paved with fine pebbles, sometimes wrought into geometric patterns, and always through pleasing sun and shade, till we reached a pretty hotel set, with its gardens before it, on a shelf of level land and commanding a view of our steamer and the surrounding sea. Tropic growths, which I will venture to call myrtle, oleander, laurel, and eucalyptus, environed the hotel, not too closely nor densely, and our increasing party was presently discovered from the head of its steps by a hospitable matron, who with a cry of comprehensive welcome ran within and was replaced by a head-waiter of as friendly aspect and much more English. He said our coupons were good there and that our luncheon would be ready in two minutes; for proof of the despatch with which we should be served he held up the first and second fingers of his right hand. Restored by his assurance, we did not really mind waiting twice the tale of all his ten fingers, and we spent our time variously in wandering about the plateau, among the wonted iron tables and chairs in front of the hotel, in being photographed in a fairy grotto behind it, and in examining the visitors\\u2019 book in the parlor. The names of visitors from South Africa largely prevailed, for the Cape Town steamers, oftener than any others, touch at Madeira, but there was one traveller of Portuguese race who had written his name in bold characters above the cry, \\u201cLong live the Portuguese Republic.\\u201d Soon after the Portuguese monarchy ceased to live for a time in the person of the murdered king and his heir, but it is doubtful if the health of the potential republic was as great as before.\\nThat bright Sunday morning no shadow of the black event was forecast, and we gave our unstinted sympathy to our unknown co-republican. The luncheon, when we were called to it, had merits of novelty and quality which I will celebrate only as regards the delicate fish fresh from the sea, and the pease fresh from the garden, with poached eggs fresh from the coop dropped upon them. The conception of chops which followed was not so faultless, though the fruit with which we ended did much to repair any error of kid which may have mistaken itself for lamb. Perhaps our enthusiasm was heightened by the fine air which had sharpened our appetites. At any rate, it all ended in an habitual transaction in real estate by which I became the owner of the place, without expropriating the actual possessor, and established there those castles in Spain belonging to me in so many parts of the world.\\nThere remained now nothing for us to do but to toboggan down the mountain, and we overcame our resolution not to do so far enough to go and look at the toboggans under the guidance of our head-waiter. When once we had looked we were lost. The toboggans were flat baskets set on iron-shod runners, and well cushioned and padded; they held one, two, or three passengers; the track on which they descended was paved, in gentle undulations, with thin pebbles set on edge and greased wherever the descent found a level. A smiling native, with a strong rope attached to the toboggan, stood on each side of it, and held it back or pulled it forward, according to the exigencies of the case. It is long since I slid down hill on a sled of my own, and I do not pretend to recall the sensation; but I can remember nothing so luxurious in transportation as the swift flight of the Madeira toboggan, which you temper at will through its guides and guards, but do not wish to temper at all when your first alarm, mainly theoretical, passes into the gayety ending in exultant rejoicing at the bottom of the course.\\nOur two toboggan men were possibly vigilant and reassuring beyond the common, but one was quite silently so; the other, who spoke a little English, encouraged us from time to time to believe that they were \\u201cstrong mans,\\u201d afterward correcting himself in conformity to the rules of Portuguese grammar, which make the adjective agree in number with the noun, and declaring that they were \\u201cstrongs mans.\\u201d We met many toboggan men who needed to be \\u201cstrongs mans\\u201d in their ascent of our track, with their heavy toboggans on their heads; but some of them did not look strong, and our own arrived spent and panting at the bottom. Something like that is what always spoils pleasure in this world. Even when you have paid for it with your money, some one else has paid with his person twice as much, and you have not equalled his outlay when you have tipped him your handsomest.\\nA shilling apiece seemed handsome for those \\u201cstrongs mans,\\u201d but afterward there were watches of the nights when the spirit grieved that the shilling had not been made two apiece or even half a crown, and I wish now that the first reader of mine who toboggans down Madeira would make up the difference for me in his tip to those poor fellows. I do not mind if he adds a few pennies for the children who ran before our toboggan and tossed camellias into it, and then followed in the hopes of a reward, which we tried not to disappoint.\\nThe future traveller need not add to the fee of the authorized and numbered guide who took possession of us as soon as we got out of our basket and led us unresisting to a waiting bullock sled. He invited himself into it, and gave himself the best of characters in the autobiography into which he wove his scanty instruction concerning the objects we passed. A bullock sled is not of such blithe progress as a toboggan, but it is very comfortable, and it is of an Oriental and litter-like dignity, with its calico cushions and curtains. One could not well use it in New York, but it serves every purpose of a cab in Funchal, where we noted a peculiar feature of local commerce which I hesitate to specify, since it cast apparent discredit upon woman. It was, as I have noted, Sunday; but every shop where things pleasing or even useful to women were sold was wide open, and somewhat flaringly invited the custom of our fellow-passengers of that sex; but there was not a shop where such things as men\\u2019s collars were for sale, or anything pleasing or useful to man, but was closed and locked fast. I must except from this sweeping statement the cafes, but these should not count, for women as well as men frequented them, as we ascertained by going to a very bowery one on the quay and ordering a bottle of the best and dryest Madeira. We wished perhaps to prove that it was really not bad for gout, or perhaps that it was no better than the Madeira you get in New York for the same price. Even with the help of friends, of the sex which could have been freely buying native laces, hats, fans, photographs, parasols, and tailor-made dresses, we could not finish that bottle. Glass after glass we bestowed on our smiling guide, with no final effect upon the bottle and none upon him, except to make him follow us to the tender and take an after-fee for showing us a way which we could not have missed blindfold. It was rather strange, but not stranger than the behavior of the captain of the tender, who, when he had collected our tickets, invited a free-will offering for collecting them, and mostly got it.\\nWhen we were safely and gladly on board our steamer again, we had nothing to do, until the deck-steward came round with tea, but watch the islanders swarming around us in their cockles and diving for sixpences and shillings, which they caught impartially with their fingers and toes. With so many all shouting and gesticulating, one could not venture one\\u2019s silver indiscriminately; one must employ some particular diver, and I selected for my investments a poor young fellow who had lost an arm. With his one hand and his two feet he never failed of the coin I risked, and I wish they had been many enough to enable him to retire from the trade, which even in that mild air kept him visibly shivering when out of the water. I do not know his name, but I commend him to future travellers by the token of his pathetic mutilation.\\nBy-and-by we felt the gentle stir of the steamer under us; the last tender went ashore, and the divers retired in their cockles from our side. Funchal began to rearrange the lines of her streets, while keeping those of her roofs and house-walls and terraced gardens. We passed out of the roadstead, we rounded the mighty headland by which we had entered, and were once more in face of that magnificent drop-curtain, which had now fallen upon one of the most vivid and novel passages of our lives.\\n\\n\\nII. TWO UP-TOWN BLOCKS INTO SPAIN\\nThere is nothing strikes the traveller in his approach to the rock of Gibraltar so much as its resemblance to the trade-mark of the Prudential Insurance Company. He cannot help feeling that the famous stronghold is pictorially a plagiarism from the advertisements of that institution. As the lines change with the ship\\u2019s course, the resemblance is less remarkable; but it is always remarkable, and I suppose it detracts somewhat from the majesty of the fortress, which we could wish to be more entirely original. This was my feeling when I first saw Gibraltar four years ago, and it remains my feeling after having last seen it four weeks ago. The eye seeks the bold, familiar legend, and one suffers a certain disappointment in its absence. Otherwise Gibraltar does not and cannot disappoint the most exacting tourist.\\nThe morning which found us in face of it was in brisk contrast to the bland afternoon on which we had parted from Madeira. No flocking coracles surrounded our steamer, with crews eager to plunge into the hissing brine for shillings or equivalent quarters. The whitecaps looked snow cold as they tossed under the sharp north wind, and the tender which put us ashore had all it could do to embark and disembark us upright, or even aslant. But, once in the lee of the rocky Africa breathed a genial warmth across the strait beyond which its summits faintly shimmered; or was it the welcome of Cook\\u2019s carriages which warmed us so? We were promised separate vehicles for parties of three or four, with English-speaking drivers, and the promise was fairly well kept. The carriages bore a strong family likeness to the pictures of Spanish state coaches of the seventeenth century, and were curtained and cushioned in reddish calico. Rubber tires are yet unknown in southern Europe, and these mediaeval arks bounded over the stones with a violence which must once have been characteristic of those in the illustrations. But the English of our English-speaking driver was all that we could have asked for the shillings we paid Cook for him, or, if it was not, it was all we got. He was an energetic young fellow and satisfyingly Spanish in coloring, but in his eagerness to please he was less grave than I could now wish; I now wish everything in Spain to have been in keeping.\\nWhat was most perfectly, most fittingly in keeping was the sight of the Moors whom we began at once to see on the wharves and in the streets. They probably looked very much like the Moors who followed their caliph, if he was a caliph, into Spain when he drove Don Roderick out of his kingdom and established his own race and religion in the Peninsula. Moslem costumes can have changed very little in the last eleven or twelve hundred years, and these handsome fellows, who had come over with fresh eggs and vegetables and chickens and turkeys from Tangier, could not have been handsomer when they bore scimitars and javelins instead of coops and baskets. They had baggy drawers on, and brown cloaks, with bare, red legs and yellow slippers; one, when he took his fez off, had a head shaved perfectly bald, like the one-eyed Calender or the Barber\\u2019s brother out of the Arabian Nights; the sparse mustache and short-forked beard heightened the verisimilitude. Whether they squatted on the wharf, or passed gravely through the street, or waited for custom in their little market among the hen-coops and the herds of rather lean, dispirited turkeys (which had not the satisfaction of their American kindred in being fattened for the sacrifice, for in Europe all turkeys are served lean), these Moors had an allure impossible to any Occidental race. It was greater even than that of their Semitic brethren, who had a market farther up in the town, and showed that a Jewish market could be much filthier than a\\u2019 Moorish market without being more picturesque. Into the web of Oriental life were wrought the dapper figures of the red-coated, red-cheeked English soldiers, with blue, blue eyes and incredible red and yellow hair, lounging or hurrying orderlies with swagger-sticks, and apparently aimless privates no doubt bent \\u2018upon quite definite business or pleasure. Now and then an English groom led an English horse through the long street from which the other streets in Gibraltar branch up and down hill, for there is no other level; and now and then an English man or woman rode trimly by.\\nThe whole place is an incongruous mixture of Latin and Saxon. The strictly South-European effect of the houses and churches is a mute protest against the alien presence which keeps the streets so clean and maintains order by means of policemen showing under the helmets of the London bobby the faces of the native alguazil. In the shops the saleswomen speak English and look Spanish. Our driver, indeed, looked more Spanish than he spoke English.\\nHis knowledge of our rude tongue extended hardly beyond the mention of certain conventional objects of interest, and did not suffice to explain why we could not see the old disused galleries of the fortifications. I do not know why we wished to see these; I doubt if we really did so, but we embittered life for that well-meaning boy by our insistence upon them, and we brought him under unjust suspicion of deceit by forcing him to a sort of time-limit in respect to them. We appealed from him to the blandest of black-mus-tached, olive-skinned bobby-alguazils, who directed us to a certain government office for a permit. There our application caused something like dismay, and we were directed to another office, but were saved from the shame of failure by incidentally learning that the galleries could not be seen till after three o\\u2019clock. As our ship sailed at that hour, we were probably saved a life-long disappointment.\\nEverywhere the rock of the Prudential beetles and towers over the town; but the fortifications are so far up in the sky that you can really distinguish nothing but the Marconi telegraphic apparatus at the top. Along the sea-level, which the town mostly keeps, the war-like harness of the stronghold shows through the civil dress of the town in barracks and specific forts and gray battle-ships lying at anchor in the docks. But all is simple and reserved, in the right English fashion. The strength of the place is not to be put forth till it is needed, which will be never, since it is hard to imagine how it can ever be even attempted by a hostile force. This is not saying, I hope, that an American fleet could not batter it down, nor leave one letter of the insurance advertisement after another on the face of the precipice.\\nThere is a pretty public garden at Gibraltar in that part of the town which is farthest from the steamer\\u2019s landing, and this proved the end of our excursion in our state coach. We found other state coaches there, and joined their passengers in strolling over the pleasant paths and trying to make out what bird it was singing somewhere in the trees. We made out an almond-tree in bloom, after some dispute; and, in fact, the climate there was much softer than at the landing, so insidiously soft that it required great force of character to keep from buying the flowers which some tasteful boys gathered from the public beds. There is a mild monument or two in this garden, to what memories I promptly failed to remember afterward; but as there are more military memories in the world than is good for it, and as these were undoubtedly military memories, I cannot much blame myself in the matter. After viewing them, there was nothing left to do but to get lunch, which we got extremely good at the hotel where a friend led us. There was at this hotel a head-waiter, in a silver-braided silk dress-coat of a mauve color, who imagined our wants so perfectly that I shall always regret not taking more of the omelette; the table-waiter urged it upon us twice with true friendliness. The eggs must have been laid for it in Africa that morning at daybreak, and brought over by a Moorish marketman, but we turned from the poetic experience of this omelette in the greedy hope of better things. Better things there could not be, but the fish was as good as the fish at Madeira, and the belief of the chops that they were lamb and not kid seemed better founded.\\nThere had been an excellent bottle of Rioja Blanca, such as you may have as good at some Spanish restaurant in New York for as little money; and the lunch, when reckoned up in English shillings and Spanish undertones, was not cheap. Yet it was not dear, either, and there was no specific charge for that silver-braided dress-coat of a mauve color. An English dean in full clericals, and some English ladies talking in the waiting-room, added an agreeable confusion to our doubt of where and what we were, and we came away from the hotel as well content as if we had lunched in Plymouth or Bath. The table-waiter took an extra fee for confiding that he was a Milanese, and was almost the only Italian in Gibraltar; whether he was right or not I do not know, but it was certainly not his fault that we did not take twice of the omelette.\\nIt is said that living is dear in Gibraltar, especially in the matter of house rent. The houses in the town are like all the houses of Latin Europe in their gray or yellowish walls of stone or stucco and their dark-green shutters. There is an English residential quarter at the east end of the town, where the houses may be different, for all I know; the English of our driver or the hire of our state coach did not enable us to visit that suburb, where the reader may imagine villas standing in grounds with lawns and gardens about them. The English have prevailed nothing against the local civilization in most things, while they have infected it with the costliness of the whole Anglo-Saxon life. We should not think seven hundred dollars in New York dear for even a quite small house, but it has come to that in Gibraltar, and there they think it dear, with other things proportionately so. Of course, it is an artificial place; the fortress makes the town, and the town in turn lives upon the fortress.\\nThe English plant themselves nowhere without gathering English conveniences or conventions about them; Americans would not always think them comforts. There is at Gibraltar a club or clubs; there is a hunt, there is a lending library, there is tennis, there is golf, there is bridge, there is a cathedral, and I dare say there is gossip, but I do not know it. It was difficult to get land for the golf links, we heard, because of the Spanish jealousy of the English occupation, which they will not have extended any farther over Spanish soil, even in golf links. Gibraltar is fondly or whimsically known to the invaders as Gib, and I believe it is rather a favorite sojourn, though in summer it is frightfully hot, held out on the knees and insteps of the rock to the burning African sun, which comes up every morning over the sea after setting Sahara on fire.\\n 05 Gibraltar from the Neutral Ground \\nAll this foreign life must be exterior to the aboriginal Spanish life which has so long outlasted the Moorish, and is not without hope of outlasting the English. I do not know what the occupations and amusements of that life are, but I will suppose them unworthy enough. There must be a certain space of neutral life uniting or dividing the two, which would form a curious inquiry, but would probably not lend itself to literary study. Besides this middle ground there is another neutral territory at Gibraltar which we traversed after luncheon, in order to say that we had been in Spain. That was the country of many more youthful dreamers in my time than, I fancy, it is in this. We used then, much more than now, to read Washington Irving, his Tales of the Alhambra, and his history of The Conquest of Granada, and we read Prescott\\u2019s histories of Spanish kings and adventures in the old world and the new. We read Don Quixote, which very few read now, and we read Gil Blas, which fewer still now read; and all these constituted Spain a realm of faery, where every sort of delightful things did or could happen. I for my part had always expected to go to Spain and live among the people I had known in those charming books, yet I had been often in Europe, and had spent whole years there without ever going near Spain. But now, I saw, was my chance, and when the friend who had been lunching with us asked if we would not like to drive across that neutral territory and go into Spain a bit, it seemed as if the dream of my youth had suddenly renewed itself with the purpose of coming immediately true. It was a charmingly characteristic foretaste of Spanish travel that the driver of the state coach which we first engaged should, when we presently came back, have replaced himself by another for no other reason than, perhaps, that he could so provide us with a worse horse. I am not sure of this theory, and I do not insist upon it, but it seems plausible.\\nAs soon as we rounded the rock of Gibraltar and struck across a flatter country than I supposed could be found within fifty miles of Gibraltar, we were swept by a blast which must have come from the Pyrenees, it was so savagely rough and cold. It may be always blowing there as a Spanish protest against the English treatment of the neutral territory; in fact, it does not seem quite the thing to build over that space as the English have done, though the structures are entirely peaceable, and it is not strange that the Spaniards have refused to meet them half-way with a good road over it, or to let them make one the whole way. They stand gravely opposed to any further incursion. Officially in all the Spanish documents the place is styled \\u201cGibraltar, temporarily occupied by Great Britain,\\u201d and there is a little town which you see sparkling in the sun no great way off in Spain called San Roque, of which the mayor is also mayor of Gibraltar; he visits his province once a year, and many people living for generations over the Spanish line keep the keys of the houses that they personally or ancestrally own in Gibraltar. The case has its pathos, but as a selfish witness I wish they had let the English make that road through the neutral territory. The present road is so bad that our state coach, in bounding over its inequalities, sometimes almost flung us into the arms of the Spanish beggars always extended toward us. They were probably most of them serious, but some of the younger ones recognized the bouffe quality of their calling. One pleasant starveling of ten or twelve entreated us for bread with a cigarette in his mouth, and, being rewarded for his impudence, entered into the spirit of the affair and asked for more, just as if we had given nothing.\\nA squalid little town grew up out of the flying gravel as we approached, and we left our state coach at the custom-house, which seemed the chief public edifice. There the inspectors did not go through the form of examining our hand-bags, as they would have done at an American frontier; and they did not pierce our carriage cushions with the long javelins with which they are armed for the detection of smuggling among the natives who have been shopping in Gibraltar. As the gates of that town are closed every day at nightfall by a patrol with drum and fife, and everybody is shut either in or out, it may easily happen with shoppers in haste to get through that they bring dutiable goods into Spain; but the official javelins rectify the error.\\nWe left our belongings in our state coach and started for that stroll in Spain which I have measured as two up-town blocks, by what I think a pretty accurate guess; two cross-town blocks I am sure it was not. It was a mean-looking street, unswept and otherwise unkempt, with the usual yellowish or grayish buildings, rather low and rather new, as if prompted by a mistaken modern enterprise. They were both shops and dwellings; I am sure of a neat pharmacy and a fresh-looking cafe restaurant, and one dwelling all faced with bright-green tiles. An alguazil\\u2014I am certain he was an alguazil, though he looked like an Italian carabiniere and wore a cocked hat\\u2014loitered into a police station; but I remember no one else during our brief stay in that street except those bouffe boy beggars. Of course, they wished to sell us postal-cards, but they were willing to accept charity on any terms. Otherwise our Spanish tour was, so far as we then knew, absolutely without incident; but when we got too far away to return we found that we had been among brigands as well as beggars, and all the Spanish picaresque fiction seemed to come true in the theft of a black chudda shawl, which had indeed been so often lost in duplicate that it was time it was entirely lost. Whether it was secretly confiscated by the customs, or was accepted as a just tribute by the populace from a poetic admirer, I do not know, but I hope it is now in the keeping of some dark-eyed Spanish girl, who will wear it while murmuring through her lattice to her novio on the pavement outside. It was rather heavy to be worn as a veil, but I am sure she could manage it after dark, and could hold it under her chin, as she leaned forward to the grille, with one little olive hand, so that the novio would think it was a black silk mantilla. Or if it was a gift from him, it would be all right, anyway.\\nOur visit to Spain did not wholly realize my early dreams of that romantic land, and yet it had not been finally destitute of incident. Besides, we had not gone very far into the country; a third block might have teemed with adventure, but we had to be back on the steamer before three o\\u2019clock, and we dared not go beyond the second. Even within this limit a love of reality underlying all my love of romance was satisfied in the impression left by that dusty, empty, silent street. It seemed somehow like the street of a new, dreary, Western American town, so that I afterward could hardly believe that the shops and restaurants had not eked out their height with dashboard fronts. It was not a place that I would have chosen for a summer sojourn; the sense of a fly-blown past must have become a vivid part of future experience, and yet I could imagine that if one were born to it, and were young and hopeful, and had some one to share one\\u2019s youth and hope, that Spanish street, which was all there was of that Spanish town, might have had its charm. I do not say that even for age there was not a railway station by which one might have got away, though there was no sign of any trains arriving or departing\\u2014perhaps because it was not one o\\u2019clock in the morning, which is the favorite hour of departure for Spanish trains.\\nWhen we turned to drive back over the neutral territory the rock of Gibraltar suddenly bulked up before us, in a sheer ascent that left the familiar Prudential view in utterly inconspicuous unimpressive-ness. Till one has seen it from this point one has not truly seen it. The vast stone shows like a half from which the other half has been sharply cleft and removed, that the sense of its precipitous magnitude may unrelievedly strike the eye; and it seems to have in that moment the whole world to tower up in from the level at its feet. No dictionary, however unabridged, has language adequate to convey the notion of it.\\n\\nIII. ASHORE AT GENOA \\nThe pride of Americans in their native scenery is brought down almost to the level of the South Shore of Long Island in arriving home from the Mediterranean voyage to Europe. The last thing one sees in Europe is the rock of Gibraltar, but before that there have been the snow-topped Maritime Alps of Italy and the gray-brown, softly rounded, velvety heights of Spain; and one has to think very hard of the Palisades above the point where they have been blasted away for road-making material if one wishes to keep up one's spirits. The last time I came home the Mediterranean way I had a struggle with myself against excusing our sandy landscape, when we came in sight of it, with its summer cottages for the sole altitudes, to some Italian fellow-passengers who were not spellbound by its grandeur. I had to remember the Rocky Mountains, which I had never seen, and all the moral magnificence of our life before I could withhold the words of apology pressing to my lips. I was glad that I succeeded; but now, going back by the same route, I abandoned myself to transports in the beauty of the Mediterranean coast which I hope were not untrue to my country. Perhaps there is no country which can show anything like that beauty, and America is no worse off than the rest of the world; but I am not sure that I have a right to this consolation. Again there were those \\\"Silent pinnacles of aged snow,\\\" flushed with the Southern sun; in those sombre slopes of pine; again the olives climbing to their gloom; again the terraced vineyards and the white farmsteads, with villages nestling in the vast clefts of the hills, and all along the sea-level the blond towns and cities which broidei the hem of the land from Marseilles to Genoa. One is willing to brag; one must be a good American; but, honestly, have we anything like that to show the arriving foreigner? For some reason our ship was abating the speed with which she had crossed the Atlantic, and now she was swimming along the Mediterranean coasts so slowly and so closely that it seemed as if we could almost have cast an apple ashore, though probably we could not. We were at least far enough off to mistake Nice for Monte Carlo and then for San Remo, but that was partly because our course was so leisurely, and we thought we must have passed Nice long before we did. It did not matter; all those places were alike beautiful under the palms of their promenades, with their scattered villas and hotels stretching along their upper levels, and the ranks of shops and dwellings solidly forming the streets which left the shipping of their ports to climb to the gardens and farms beyond the villas. Cannes, Mentone, Ventimiglia, Ospedeletti, Bordighera, Taggia, Alassio: was that their fair succession, or did they follow in another order? Once more it did not matter; what is certain is that the golden sun of the soft January afternoon turned to crimson and left the last of them suffused in dim rose before we drifted into Genoa and came to anchor at dusk beside a steamer which had left New York on the same day as ours. By her vast size we could measure our own and have an objective perception of our grandeur. We had crossed in one of the largest ships afloat, but you cannot be both spectacle and spectator; and you must match your magnificence with some rival magnificence before you can have a due sense of it. That was what we now got at Genoa, and we could not help pitying the people on that other ship, who must have suffered shame from our overwhelming magnitude; the fact that she was of nearly the same tonnage as our own ship had nothing to do with the case. \\nAfter the creamy and rosy tints of those daughters of climate along the Riviera, it was pleasant to find a many-centuried mother of commerce like Genoa of the dignified gray which she wears to the eye, whether it looks down on her from the heights above her port or up at her from the thickly masted and thickly funnelled waters of the harbor. Most European towns have red tiled roofs, which one gets rather tired of putting into one's word paintings, but the roofs of Genoa are gray tiled, and gray are her serried house walls, and gray her many churches and bell-towers. The sober tone gratifies your eye immensely, and the fact that your eye has noted it and not attributed the conventional coloring of southern Europe to the city is a flattery to your pride which you will not refuse. It is not a setting for opera like Naples; there is something businesslike in it which agrees with your American mood if you are true to America, and recalls you to duty if you are not. I had not been in Genoa since 1864 except for a few days in 1905, and I saw changes which I will mostly not specify. Already at the earlier date the railway had cut through the beautiful and reverend Doria garden and left the old palace some scanty grounds on the sea-level, where commerce noisily encompassed it with trains and tracks and lines of freight-cars. But there had remained up to my last visit that grot on the gardened hill-slope whence a colossal marble Hercules helplessly overlooked the offence offered by the railroad; and now suddenly here was the lofty wall of some new edifice stretching across in front of the Hercules and wholly shutting him from view; for all I know it may have made him part of its structure. Let this stand for a type of the change which had passed upon Genoa and has passed or is passing upon all Italy. The trouble is that Italy is full of very living Italians, the quickest-witted people in the world, who are alert to seize every chance for bettering themselves financially as they have bettered themselves politically. For my part, I always wonder they do not still rule the world when I see how intellectually fit they are to do it, how beyond any other race they seem still equipped for their ancient primacy. Possibly it is their ancient primacy which hangs about their necks and loads them down. It is better to have too little past, as we have, than too much, as they have. But if antiquity hampers them, they are tenderer of its vast mass than we are of our little fragments of it; tenderer than any other people, except perhaps the English, have shown themselves; but when the time comes that the past stands distinctly in the way of the future, down goes the past, even in Italy. I am not saying that I do not see why that railroad could not have tunnelled under the Doria garden rather than cut through it; and I am waiting for that new building to justify its behavior toward that poor old Hercules; but in the mean time I hold that Italy is for the Italians who now live in it, and have to get that better living out of it which we others all want our countries to yield us; and that it is not merely a playground for tourists who wish to sentimentalize it, or study it, or sketch it, or make copy of it, as I am doing now. All the same I will not deny that I enjoyed more than any of the improvements which I noted in Genoa that bit of the old Doria palace-grounds which progress has left it. The gray edifice looks out on the neighboring traffic across the leanness of a lovely old garden, with statues and stone seats, and in the midst a softly soliloquizing fountain, painted green with moss and mould. When you enter the palace, as you do in response to a custodian who soon comes with a key and asks if you would like to see it, you find yourself, one flight up, in a long glazed gallery, fronting on the garden, which is so warm with the sun that you wish to spend the rest of your stay in Genoa there. It is frescoed round with classically imagined portraits of the different Dorias, and above all the portrait of that great hero of the republic. I do not know that this portrait particularly impresses you; if you have been here before you will be reserving yourself for the portrait which the custodian will lead you to see in the ultimate chamber of the rather rude old palace, where it is like a living presence. It is the picture of a very old man in a flat cap, sitting sunken forward in his deep chair, with his thin, long hands folded one on the other, and looking wearily at you out of his faded eyes, in which dwell the memories of action in every sort and counsel in every kind. Victor in battles by land and sea, statesman and leader and sage, he looks it all in that wonderful effigy, which shuns no effect of his more than ninety years, but confesses his great age as a part of his greatness with a pathetic reality. The white beard, with \\\"each particular hair\\\" defined, falling almost to the pale, lean hands, is an essential part of the presentment, which is full of such scrupulous detail as the eye would unconsciously take note of in confronting the man himself and afterward supply in the remembrance of the whole. As if it were a part of his personality, on a table facing him, covered with maps and papers, sits the mighty admiral's cat, which, with true feline im-passiveness, ignores the spectator and gives its sole regard to the admiral. There are possibly better portraits in the world than this, which was once by Sebastiano del Piombo and is now by Titian; but I remember none which has moved me more. We tried in vain for a photograph of it, and then after a brief glance at the riches of the Church of the Annunziata, where we were followed around the interior by a sacristan who desired us to note that the pillars were \\\"All inlady, all inlady\\\" with different marbles, and, after a chilly moment in San Lorenzo, which the worshippers and the masons were sharing between them in the prayers and repairs always going on in cathedrals, we drove for luncheon to the hotel where we had sojourned in great comfort three years before. Genoa has rather a bad name for its hotels, but we had found this one charming, perhaps because when we had objected to going five flights up the landlord had led us yet a floor higher, that we might walk into the garden. It is so in much of Genoa, where the precipitous nature of the site makes this vivid contrast between the levels of the front door and the back gate. Many of the streets have been widened since Heine saw the gossiping neighbors touching knees across them, but nothing less than an earthquake could change the temperamental topography of the place. It has its advantages; when there is a ring at the door the housemaid, instead of panting up from the kitchen to answer it, has merely to fall down five pairs of stairs. It cannot be denied, either, that the steep incline gives a charm to the streets which overcome it with sidewalks and driveways and trolley-tracks. Such a street as the Via Garibaldi (there is a Via Garibaldi in every Italian city, town, and village, and ought to be a dozen), compactly built, but giving here and there over the houses' shoulders glimpses of the gardens lurking behind them, is of a dignity full of the energy which a flat thoroughfare never displays or imparts. Without the inspiration lent us by the street, I am sure we should never have got to the top of it with our cab when we went to the Campo Santo; and, as it was, we had to help our horses upward by involuntarily straining forward from our places. But the Campo Santo was richly worth the effort, for to visit that famous cemetery is to enjoy an experience of which it is the unique opportunity. I wish to celebrate it because it seems to me one of the frankest expressions of national taste and nature, and I do like simplicity - in others. The modern Italians are the most literal of the realists in all the arts, and, as I had striven for reality in my own poor way, I was perhaps the more curious to see its effects in sculpture which I had heard of so much. I will own that they went far beyond my expectation and possibly my wishes; but it is not to be supposed that it is only inferior artists who have abandoned themselves to the excesses of fidelity so abundant in the Campo Santo. There are, of course, enough poor falterings of allegory and tradition in the marble walls and floors of this vast residence of the dead (as it gives you the cheerful impression of being), but the characteristic note of the place is a realism braving it out in every extreme of actuality. Possibly the fact is most striking in that death-bed scene where the family, life-size and unsparingly portraitured, and, as it were, photographed in marble, are gathered in the room of the dying mother. She lies on a bedstead which bears every mark of being one of a standard chamber-set in the early eighteen-seventies, and about her stand her husband and her sons and daughters and their wives and husbands, in the fashions of that day. I recall a brother, in a cutaway coat, and a daughter, in a tie-back, embraced in their grief and turning their faces away from their mother toward the spectator; and doubtless there were others whom to describe in their dress would render as grotesque. It is enough to say that the artist, of a name well known in Italy and of uncommon gift, has been as true to the moment in their costume as to the eternal humanity in their faces. He has done what the sculptor or painter of the great periods of art used to do with their historical and scriptural people - he has put them in the dress of his own time and place; and it is impossible to deny him a convincing logic. No sophistry or convention of drapery in the scene could have conveyed its pathos half so well, or indeed at all. It does make you shudder, I allow; it sets your teeth on edge; but then, if you are a real man or woman, it brings the lump into your throat; the smile fails from your lip; you pay the tribute of genuine pity and awe. I will not pretend that I was so much moved by the meeting in heaven of a son and father: the spirit of the son in a cutaway, with a derby hat in his hand, gazing with rapture into the face of the father's spirit in a long sack-coat holding his marble bowler elegantly away from his side, if I remember rightly. But here the fact wanted the basis of simplicity so strong in the other scene; in the mixture of the real and the ideal the group was romanticistic. There are innumerable other portrait figures and busts in which the civic and social hour is expressed. The women's hair is dressed in this fashionable way or that; the men's beards are cut in conformity to the fashion or the personal preference in side whiskers or mustache or imperial or goatee; and their bronze or marble faces convey the contemporary character of aristocrat or bourgeois or politician or professional. I do not know just what the reader would expect me to say in defence of the full-length figure of a lady in decollete and trained evening dress, who enters from the tomb toward the spectator as if she were coming into a drawing-room after dinner. She is very beautiful, but she is no longer very young, and the bare arms, which hang gracefully at her side, respond to an intimation of embonpoint in the figure, with a slightly flabby over-largeness where they lose themselves in the ample shoulders. Whether this figure is the fancy of the sorrowing husband or the caprice of the defunct herself, who wished to be shown to after-time as she hoped she looked in the past, I do not know; but I had the same difficulty with it as I had with that father and son; it was romanticistic. Wholly realistic and rightly actual was that figure of an old woman who is said to have put by all her savings from the grocery business that she might appear properly in the Campo Santo, and who is shown there short and stout and common, in her ill-fitting best dress, but motherly and kind and of an undeniable and touching dignity. If I am giving the reader the impression that I went to the Campo Santo in my last stop at Genoa, I am deceiving him; I record here the memories of four years ago. I did not revisit the place, but I should like to see it again, if only to revive my recollections of its unique interest. I did really revisit the Pal-lavicini-Durazzo palace, and there revived the pleasure I had known before in its wonderful Van Dycks. Most wonderful was and will always be the \\\"Boy in White,\\\" the little serene princeling, whoever he was, in whom the painter has fixed forever a bewitching mood and moment of childhood. \\\"The Mother with two Children\\\" is very well and self-evidently true to personality and period and position; but, after all, she is nothing beside that \\\"Boy in White,\\\" though she and her children are otherwise so wonderful. Now that I speak of her, however, she rather grows upon my recollection as a woman greater than her great world and proudly weary of it. \\nShe was a lady of that very patrician house whose palace, in its cold grandeur and splendor, renews at once all one's faded or fading sense of the commercial past of Italy, when her greatest merchants were her greatest nobles and dwelt in magnificence unparalleled yet since Rome began to be old. Genoa, Venice, Pisa, Florence, what state their business men housed themselves in and environed themselves with! Their palaces by the hundreds were such as only the public edifices of our less simple State capitols could equal in size and not surpass in cost. Their folie des grandeurs realized illusions in architecture, in sculpture, and in painting which the assembled and concentrated feats of those arts all the way up and down Fifth Avenue, and in the millionaire blocks eastward could not produce the likeness of. We have the same madness in our brains; we have even a Roman megalomania, but the effect of it in Chicago or Pittsburg or Philadelphia or New York has not yet got beyond a ducal or a princely son-in-law. The splendors of such alliances have still to take substantial form in a single instance worthy to compare with a thousand instances in the commercial republics of Italy. This does not mean that our rich people have not so much money as the Italians of the Renaissance, but that perhaps in their folie des grandeurs they are a different kind of madmen; it means also that land and labor are dearer positively and comparatively with us, and that our pork-packing or stock-broking princes prefer to spend on comfort rather than size in their houses, and do not like the cold feet which the merchant princes of Italy must have had from generation to generation. I shall always be sorry I did not wear arctics when I went to the Pallavicini-Durazzo palace, and I strongly urge the reader to do so when he goes. He will not so much need them out-of-doors in a Genoese January, unless a tramontana is blowing, and there was none on our half-day. But in any case we did not walk. We selected the best-looking cab-horse we could find, and he turned out better than his driver, who asked a fabulous price by the hour. We obliged him to show his tariff, when his wickedness was apparent from the printed rates. He explained that the part we were looking at was obsolete, and he showed us another part, which was really for drives outside the city; but we agreed to pay it, and set out hoping for good behavior from him that would make up the difference. Again we were deceived; at the end he demanded a franc beyond even his unnatural fare. I urged that one should be reasonable; but he seemed to think not, and to avoid controversy I paid the extortionate franc. I remembered that just a month before, in New York, I had paid an extortionate dollar in like circumstances. Nevertheless, that franc above and beyond the stipulated extortion impoverished me, and when we came to take a rowboat back to our steamer I beat the boatman down cruelly, mercilessly. He was a poor, lean little man, with rather a superannuated boat, and he labored harder at the oar than I could bear to see without noting his exertion to him. This was fatal; instantly he owned that I was right, and he confessed, moreover, that he was the father of a family, and that some of his children were then suffering from sickness as well as want. What could one do but make the fare up to the first demand of three francs after having got the price down to one and a half? At the time it seemed to me that I was somehow by this means getting the better of the cabman who had obliged me to pay a franc more than his stipulated extortion, but I do not now hope to make it appear so to the reader. \\n\\nIV. NAPLES AND HER JOYFUL NOISE \\nWe heard the joyful noise of Naples as soon as our steamer came to anchor within the moles whose rigid lines perhaps disfigure her famous bay, while they render her harbor so secure. The noise first rose to us, hanging over the guard, and trying to get phrases for the glory of her sea and sky and mountains and monuments, from a boat which seemed to have been keeping abreast of us ever since we had slowed up. It was not a largo boat, but it managed to contain two men with mandolins, a mother of a family with a guitar, and a young girl with an alternate tambourine and umbrella. The last instrument was inverted to catch the coins, such as they were, which the passengers flung down to the minstrels for their repetitions of \\\"Santa Lucia,\\\" \\\"Funicoli-Funicola,\\\" \\\"II Cacciatore,\\\" and other popular Neapolitan airs, such as \\\"John Brown's Body\\\" and \\\"In the Bowery.\\\" To the songs that had a waltz movement the mother of a family performed a restricted dance, at some risk of falling overboard, while she smiled radiantly up at us, as, in fact, they all did, except the young girl, who had to play simultaneously on her tambourine and her inverted umbrella, and seemed careworn. Her anxiety visibly deepened to despair when she missed a shilling, which must have looked as large to her as a full moon as it sank slowly down into the sea. \\nBut her despair did not last long; nothing lasts long in Naples except the joyful noise, which is incessant and perpetual, and which seems the expression of the universal temperament in both man and beast. Our good-fortune placed us in a hotel fronting the famous Castel dell' Ovo, across a little space of land and water, and we could hear, late and early, the cackling and crowing of the chickens which have replaced the hapless prisoners of other days in that fortress. At times the voices of the hens were lifted in a choral of self-praise, as if they had among them just laid the mighty structure which takes its name from its resemblance to the egg they ordinarily produce. In other lands the peculiar note of the donkey is not thought very melodious, but in Naples before it can fade away it is caught up in the general orchestration and ceases in music. The cabmen at our corner, lying in wait by scores for the strangers whom it is their convention to suppose ignorant of their want of a carriage, quarrelled rhythmically with one another; the mendicants, lying everywhere in wait for charity, murmured a modulated appeal; if you heard shouts or yells afar off they died upon your ear in a strain of melody at the moment when they were lifted highest. I am aware of seeming to burlesque the operatic fact which every one must have noticed in Naples; and I will not say that the neglected or affronted babe, or the trodden dog, is as tuneful as the midnight cat there, but only that they approach it in the prevailing tendency of all the local discords to soften and lose themselves in the general unison. This embraces the clatter of the cabs, which are seldom less than fifty years old, and of a looseness in all their joints responsive to their effect of dusty decrepitude. Their clatter penetrates the volumed tread of the myriad feet in a city where, if you did not see all sorts of people driving, you would say the whole population walked. Above the manifold noises gayly springing to the sky spreads and swims the clangor of the church-bells and holds the terrestrial uproar in immeasurable solution. It would be rash to say that the whole population of Naples is always in the street, for if you look into the shops or cafes, or, I dare say, the houses, you will find them quite full; but the general statement verifies itself almost tiresomely in its agreement with what everybody has always said of Naples. It is so quite what you expect that if you could you would turn away in satiety, especially from the swarming life of the poor, which seems to have no concealments from the public, but frankly works at all the trades and arts that can be carried on out-of-doors; cooks, eats, laughs, cries, sleeps, wakes, makes love, quarrels, scolds, does everything but wash itself - clothes enough it washes for other people's life. There is a reason for this in the fact that in bad weather at Naples it is cold and dark and damp in-doors, and in fine so bright and warm and charming without that there is really no choice. Then there is the expansive temperament, which if it were shut up would probably be much more explosive than it is now. As it is, it vents itself in volleyed detonations and scattered shots which language can give no sense of. For the true sense of it you must go to Naples, and then you will never lose the sense of it. I had not been there since 1864, but when I woke up the morning after my arrival, and heard the chickens cackling in the Castel dell' Ovo, and the donkeys braying, and the cab-drivers quarrelling, and the cries of the street vendors, and the dogs barking, and the children wailing, and their mothers scolding, and the clatter of wheels and hoops and feet, and all that mighty harmony of the joyful Neapolitan noises, it seemed to me that it was the first morning after my first arrival, and I was still only twenty-seven years old. As soon as possible, when the short but sweet Vincenzo had brought up my breakfast of tea and bread-and-butter and honey (to which my appetite turned from the gross superabundance of the steamer's breakfasts with instant acquiescence), and announced with a smile as liberal as the sunshine that it was a fine day, I went out for those impressions which I had better make over to the reader in their original disorder. Vesuvius, which was silver veiled the day before, was now of a soft, smoky white, and the sea, of a milky blue, swam round the shore and out to every dim island and low cape and cliffy promontory. The street was full of people on foot and in trolleys and cabs and donkey pleasure-carts, and the familiar teasing of cabmen and peddlers and beggars began with my first steps toward what I remembered as the Toledo, but what now called itself, with the moderner Italian patriotism, the Via Roma. The sole poetic novelty of my experience was in my being offered loaves of bread which, when I bought them, would be given to the poor, in honor of what saint's day I did not learn. But it was all charming; even the inattention of the young woman over the book-counter was charming, since it was a condition of her flirtation with the far younger man beside me who wanted something far more interesting from her than any brief sketch of the history of Naples, in either English or Italian or French or, at the worst, German. She was very pretty, though rather powdered, and when the young man went away she was sympathetically regretful to me that there was no such sketch, in place of which she offered me several large histories in more or less volumes. But why should I have wanted a history of Naples when I had Naples itself? It was like wanting a photograph when you have the original. Had I not just come through the splendid Piazza San Ferdinando, with the nobly arcaded church on one hand and the many-statued royal palace on the other, and between them a lake of mellow sunshine, as warm as ours in June? What I found Naples and the Neapolitans in 1908 I had found them in 1864, and Mr. Gray (as he of the \\\"Elegy\\\" used to be called on his title-pages) found them in 1740. \\\"The streets,\\\" he wrote home to his mother, \\\"are one continued market, and thronged with populace so much that a coach can hardly pass. The common sort are a jolly, lively kind of animals, more industrious than Italians usually are; they work till evening; then they take their lute or guitar (for they all play) and walk about the city or upon the seashore with it, to enjoy the fresco.\\\" There was, in fact, a bold gayety in the aspect of the city, without the refinement which you do not begin to feel till you get into North Italy. When I came upon church after church, with its facade of Spanish baroque, I lamented the want of Gothic delicacy and beauty, but I was consoled abundantly later in the churches antedating the Spanish domination. I had no reason, such as travellers give for hating places, to be dissatisfied with Naples in any way. I had been warned that the customs officers were terrible there, and that I might be kept hours with my baggage. But the inspector, after the politest demand for a declaration of tobacco, ordered only a small valise, the Benjamin of its tribe, opened and then closed untouched; and his courteous forbearance, acknowledged later through the hotel porter, cost me but a dollar. The hotel itself was inexpressibly better in lighting, heating, service, and table than any New York hotel at twice the money - in fact, no money could buy the like with us at any hotel I know of; but this is a theme which I hope to treat more fully hereafter. It is true that the streets of Naples are very long and rather narrow and pretty crooked, and full of a damp cold that no sunlight seems ever to hunt out of them; but then they are seldom ironed down with trolley-tracks; the cabs feel their way among the swarming crowds with warning voices and smacking whips; even the prepotent automobile shows some tenderness for human life and limb, and proceeds still more cautiously than the cabs and carts - in fact, I thought I saw recurrent proofs of that respect for the average man which seems the characteristic note of Italian liberty; and this belief of mine, bred of my first observations in Naples, did not, after twelve weeks in Italy, prove an illusion. If it is not the equality we fancy ourselves having, it is rather more fraternity in effect. \\nThe failure of other researches for that sketch of Neapolitan history left me in the final ignorance which I must share with the reader; but my inquiries brought me prompt knowledge of one of those charming features in which the Italian cities excel, if they are not unique. I remember too vaguely the Galleria, as they call the beautiful glazed arcade of Milan, to be sure that it is finer than the Galleria at Naples, but I am sure this is finer than that at Genoa, with which, however, I know nothing in other cities to compare. The Neapolitan gallery, wider than any avenue of the place, branching in the form of a Greek cross to four principal streets, is lighted by its roof of glass, and a hundred brilliant shops and cafes spread their business and leisure over its marble floor. Nothing could be architecturally more cheerful, and, if it were not too hot in summer, there could be no doubt of its adaptation to our year, for it could be easily closed against the winter by great portals, and at other seasons would give that out-door expansion which in Latin countries hospitably offers the spectacle of pleasant eating and drinking to people who have nothing to eat and drink. These spectators could be kept at a distance with us by porters at the entrances, while they would not be altogether deprived of the gratifying glimpses. I do not know whether poverty avails itself of its privileges by visiting the Neapolitan gallery; but probably, like poverty elsewhere, it is too much interested by the drama of life in its own quarter ever willingly to leave it. Poverty is very conservative, for reasons more than one; its quarter in Naples is the oldest, and was the most responsive to our recollections of the Naples of 1864. Overhead the houses tower and beetle with their balconies and bulging casements, shutting the sun, except at noon, from the squalor below, where the varied dwellers bargain and battle and ply their different trades, bringing their work from the dusk of cavernous shops to their doorways for the advantage of the prevailing twilight. Carpentry and tailoring and painting and plumbing, locksmithing and copper-smithing go on there, touching elbows with frying and feeding, and the vending of all the strange and hideous forms of flesh, fish, and fowl. If you wish to know how much the tentacle of a small polyp is worth you may chance to see a cent pass for it from the crone who buys to the boy who sells it smoking from the kettle; but the price of cooked cabbage or pumpkin must remain a mystery, along with that of many raw vegetables and the more revolting viscera of the less-recognizable animals. The poor people worming in and out around your cab are very patient of your progress over the terrible floor of their crooked thoroughfare, perhaps because they reciprocate your curiosity, and perhaps because they are very amiable and not very sensitive. They are not always crowded into these dismal chasms; their quarter expands here and there into market-plates, like the fish-market where the uprising of the fisherman Masaniello against the Spaniards fitly took place; and the Jewish market-place, where the poor young Corra-dino, last of the imperial Hohenstaufen line, was less appropriately beheaded by the Angevines. The open spaces are not less loathsome than the reeking alleys, but if you have the intelligent guide we had you approach them through the triumphal arch by which Charles V. entered Naples, and that is something. Yet we will now talk less of the emperor than of the guide, who appealed more to my sympathy. He had been six years in America, which he adored, because, he said, he had got work and earned his living there the very day he landed. That was in Boston, where he turned his hand first to one thing and then another, and came away at last through some call home, honoring and loving the Americans as the kindest, the noblest, the friendliest people in the world. I tried, politely, to persuade him that we were not all of us all he thought us, but he would not yield, and at one place he generously claimed a pre-eminence in wickedness for his fellow-Neapolitans. That was when we came to a vast, sorrowful prison, from which an iron cage projected into the street. Around this cage wretched women and children and old men clustered till the prisoners dear to them were let into it from the jail and allowed to speak with them. The scene was as public as all of life and death is in Naples, and the publicity seemed to give it peculiar sadness, which I noted to our guide. He owned its pathos; \\\"but,\\\" he said, \\\"you know we have a terrible class of people here in Naples.\\\" I protested that there were terrible classes of people everywhere, even in America. He would not consent entirely, but in partly convincing each other we became better friends. He had a large black mustache and gentle black eyes, and he spoke very fair English, which, when he wished to be most impressive, he dropped and used a very literary Italian instead. He showed us where he lived, on a hill-top back of our gardened quay, and said that he paid twelve dollars a month for a tenement of five rooms there. Schooling is compulsory in Naples, but he sends his boy willingly, and has him especially study English as the best provision he can make for him - as heir of his own calling of cicerone, perhaps. He has a little farm at Bavello, which he tills when it is past the season for cultivating foreigners in Naples; he expects to spend his old age there; and I thought it not a bad lookout. He was perfectly well-mannered, and at a hotel where we stopped for tea he took his coffee at our table unbidden, like any American fellow-man. He and the landlord had their joke together, the landlord warning me against him in English as \\\"very bad man,\\\" and clapping him affectionately on the shoulder to emphasize the irony. We did not demand too much social information of him; all the more we valued the gratuitous fact that the Neapolitan nobles were now rather poor, because they preferred a life of pleasure to a life of business. I could have told him that the American nobles were increasingly like them in their love of pleasure, but I would not have known how to explain that they were not poor also. He was himself a moderate in politics, but he told us, what seems to be the fact everywhere in Italy, that singly the largest party in Naples is the Socialist party. He went with me first one day to the beautiful old Church of Santa Chiara, to show me the Angevine tombs there, in which I satisfied a secret, lingering love for the Gothic; and then to the cathedral, where the sacristan showed us everything but the blood of St. Jannarius, perhaps because it was not then in the act of liquefying; but I am thankful to say I saw one of his finger-bones. My guide had made me observe how several of the churches on the way to this were built on the sites and of the remnants of pagan temples, and he summoned the world-old sacristan of St. Januarius to show us evidences of a rival antiquity in the crypt; for it had begun as a temple of Neptune. The sacristan practically lived in those depths and the chill sanctuary above them, and-he was so full of rheumatism that you could almost hear it creak as he walked; yet he was a cheerful sage, and satisfied with the fee which my guide gave him and which he made small, as he explained, that the sacristan might not be discontented with future largesse. I need not say that each church we visited had its tutelary beggar, and that my happy youth came back to me in the blindness of one, or the mutilation of another, or the haggish wrinkles of a third. At Santa Chiara I could not at first make out what it was which caused my heart to rejoice so; but then I found that it was because the church was closed, and we had to go and dig a torpid monk out of his crevice in a cold, many-storied cliff near by, and get him to come and open it, just as I used, with the help of neighbors, to do in the past. Our day ended at sunset - a sunset of watermelon red - with a visit to the Castel Nuovo, where my guide found himself at home with the garrison, because, as he explained, he had served his term as a soldier. He was the born friend of the custodian of the castle church, which was the most comfortable church for warmth we had visited, and to which we entered by the bronze gates of the triumphal arch raised in honor of the Aragonese victory over the Angevines in 1442, when this New Castle was newer than it is now. The bronze gates record in bas-relief the battles between the French and Spanish powers in their quarrel over the people one or other must make its prey; but whether it was to the greater advantage of the Neapolitans to be battened on by the house of Aragon and then that of Bourbon for the next six hundred years after the Angevines had retired from the banquet is problematical. History is a very baffling study, and one may be well content to know little or nothing about it. I knew so little or had forgotten so much that I scarcely deserved to be taken down into the crypt of this church and shown the skeletons of four conspirators for Anjou whom Aragon had put to death - two laymen and an archbishop by beheading, and a woman by dividing crosswise into thirds. The skeletons lay in their tattered and dusty shrouds, and I suppose were authentic enough; but I had met them, poor things, too late in my life to wish for their further acquaintance. Once I could have exulted to search out their story and make much of it; but now I must leave it to the reader's imagination, along with most other facts of my observation in Naples. I was at some pains to look up the traces of my lost youth there, and if I could have found more of them no doubt I should have been more interested in these skeletons. For forty-odd years I had remembered the prodigious picturesqueness of certain streets branching from a busy avenue and ascending to uplands above by stately successions of steps. When I demanded these of my guide, he promptly satisfied me, and in a few moments, there in the Chiaja, we stood at the foot of such a public staircase. I had no wish to climb it, but I found it more charming even than I remembered. All the way to the top it was banked on either side with glowing masses of flowers and fruits and the spectacular vegetables of the South, and between these there were series of people, whom I tacitly delegated to make the ascent for me, passing the groups bargaining at the stalls. Nothing could have been better; nothing that I think of is half so well in New York, where the markets are on that dead level which in the social structure those above it abhor; though there are places on the East River where we might easily have inclined markets. \\nOther associations of that far past awoke with my identification of the hotel where we had stayed at the end of the Villa Nazionale. In those days the hotel was called, in appeal to our patriotism, more flattered then than now in Europe, Hotel Washington; but it is to-day a mere pension, though it looks over the same length of palm-shaded, statue-peopled garden. The palms were larger than I remembered them, and the statues had grown up and seemed to have had large families since my day; but the lovely sea was the same, with all the mural decorations of the skyey horizons beyond, dim precipices and dreamy island tops, and the dozing Vesuvius mistakable for any of them. At one place there was a file of fishermen, including a fisherwoman, drawing their net by means of a rope carried across the carriage-way from the seawall, with a splendid show of their black eyes and white teeth and swarthy, bare legs, and always there were beggars, both of those who frankly begged and those who importuned with postal-cards. This terrible traffic pervades all southern Europe, and everywhere pesters the meeting traveller with undesired bargains. In its presence it is almost impossible to fit a scene with the apposite phrase; and yet one must own that it has its rights. What would those boys do if they did not sell, or fail to sell, postal-cards. It is another aspect of the labor problem, so many-faced in our time. Would it be better that they should take to open mendicancy, or try to win the soft American heart with such acquired slang as \\\"Skiddoo to twenty-three\\\"? One who had no postal-cards had English enough to say he would go away for a penny; it was his price, and I did not see how he could take less; when he was reproached by a citizen of uncommon austerity for his shameless annoyance of strangers, I could not see that he looked abashed - in fact, he went away singing. He did not take with him the divine beauty of the afternoon light on the sea and mountains; and, if he was satisfied, we were content with our bargain. In fact, it would be impossible to exaggerate in the praise of that incomparable environment. At every hour of the day, and, for all I know, the night, it had a varying beauty and a constant loveliness. Six days out of the week of our stay the sunshine was glorious, and five days of at least a May or September warmth; and though one day was shrill and stiff with the tramontana, it was of as glorious sunshine as the rest. The gale had blown my window open and chilled my room, but with that sun blazing outside I could not believe in the hurricane which seemed to blow our car up the funicular railway when we mounted to the height where the famous old Convent of San Martino stands, and then blew us all about the dust-clouded streets of that upland in our search for the right way to the monastery. It was worth more than we suffered in finding it; for the museum is a record of the most significant events of Neapolitan history from the time of the Spanish domination down to that of the Garibaldian invasion; and the church and corridors through which the wind hustled us abound in paintings and frescos such as one would be willing to give a whole week of quiet weather to. I do not know but I should like to walk always in the convent garden, or merely look into it from my window in the cloister wall, and gossip with my fellow-friars at their windows. We should all be ghosts, of course, but the more easily could the sun warm us through in spite of the tramontana. \\nI do not know that Naples is very beautiful in certain phases in which Venice and Genoa are excellent. Those cities were adorned by their sons with palaces of an outlook worthy of their splendor. But in the other Italian cities the homes of her patricians were crowded into the narrow streets where their architecture fails of its due effect. It is so with them in Naples, and even along the Villa Nazionale, where many palatial villas are set, they seclude themselves in gardens where one fancies rather than sees them. These are, in fact, sometimes the houses of the richest bourgeoisie - bankers and financiers - and the houses which have names conspicuous in the mainly inglorious turmoil of Neapolitan history help unnoted to darken the narrow and winding ways of the old city. A glimpse of a deep court or of a towering facade is what you get in passing, but it is to be said of the sunless streets over which they gloom that they are kept in a modern neatness beside which the dirt of New York is mediaeval. It is so with most other streets in Naples, except those poorest ones where the out-door life insists upon the most intimate domestic expression. Even such streets are no worse than our worst streets, and the good streets are all better kept than our best. I am not sure that there are even more beggars in Naples than in New York, though I will own that I kept no count. In both cities beggary is common enough, and I am not noting it with disfavor in either, for it is one of my heresies that comfort should be constantly reminded of misery by the sight of it - comfort is so forgetful. Besides, in Italy charity costs so little; a cent of our money pays a man for the loss of a leg or an arm; two cents is the compensation for total blindness; a sick mother with a brood of starving children is richly rewarded for her pains with a nickel worth four cents. Organized charity is not absent in the midst of such volunteers of poverty; one day, when we thought we had passed the last outpost of want in our drive, two Sisters of Charity suddenly appeared with out-stretched tin cups. Our driver did not imagine our inexhaustible benovelence; he drove on, and before we could bring him to a halt the Sisters of Charity ran us down, their black robes flying abroad and their sweet faces flushed with the pursuit. Upon the whole it was very humiliating; we could have wished to offer our excuses and regrets; but our silver seemed enough, and the gentle sisters fell back when we had given it. That was while we were driving toward Posilipo for the beauty of the prospect along the sea and shore, and for a sense of which any colored postal-card will suffice better than the most hectic word-painting. The worst of Italy is the superabundance of the riches it offers ear and eye and nose - offers every sense - ending in a glut of pleasure. At the point where we descended from our carriage to look from the upland out over the vast hollow of land and sea toward Pozzuoli, which is so interesting as the scene of Jove's memorable struggle with the Titans, and just when we were really beginning to feel equal to it, a company of minstrels suddenly burst upon us with guitars and mandolins and comic songs much dramatized, while the immediate natives offered us violets and other distracting flowers. In the effect, art and nature combined to neutralize each other, as they do with us, for instance, in those restaurants where they have music during dinner, and where you do not know whether you are eating the chef-d'oeuvre of a cook or a composer. It was at the new hotel which is evolving itself through the repair of the never-finished and long-ruined Palace of Donn' Anna, wife of a Spanish viceroy in the seventeenth century, that our guide stopped with us for that cup of tea already mentioned. We had to climb four nights of stairs for it to the magnificent salon overlooking the finest postal-card prospect in all Naples. We lingered long upon it, in the balcony from which we could have dropped into the sunset sea any coin which we could have brought ourselves to part with; but we had none of the bad money which had been so easily passed off upon us. This sort rather abounds in Naples, and the traveller should watch not only for false francs, but for francs of an obsolete coinage which you can know by the king's head having a longer neck than in the current pieces. At the bookseller's they would not take a perfectly good five-franc piece because it was so old as 1815; and what becomes of all the bad money one innocently takes for good? One fraudulent franc I made a virtue of throwing away; but I do not know what I did with a copper refused by a trolley conductor as counterfeit. I could not take the affair seriously, and perhaps I gave that copper in charity. As we drove hotelward through the pink twilight we met many carriages of people who looked rich and noble, but whether they were so I do not know. I only know that old ladies who regard the world severely from their coaches behind the backs of their perfectly appointed coachmen and footmen ought to be both, and that old gentlemen who frown over their white mustaches have no right to their looks if they are neither. It was, at any rate, the hour of the fashionable drive, which included a pause midway of the Villa Nazionale for the music of the military band. The band plays near the Aquarium, which I hope the reader will visit at the earlier hours of the day. Then, if he has a passion for polyps, and wishes to imagine how they could ingulf good-sized ships in the ages of fable, he can see one of the hideous things float from its torpor in the bottom of its tank, and seize Avith its hungry tentacles the food lowered to it by a string. Still awfuller is it to see it rise and reach with those prehensile members, as with the tails of a multi-caudate ape, some rocky projection of its walls and lurk fearsomely into the hollow, and vanish there in a loathly quiescence. The carnivorous spray and bloom of the deep-sea flowers amid which drowned men's \\\"bones are coral made\\\" seem of one temperament with the polyps as they slowly, slowly wave their tendrils and petals; but there is amusement if not pleasure in store for the traveller who turns from them to the company of shad softly and continuously circling in their tank, and regarding the spectators with a surly dignity becoming to people in better society than others. One large shad, imaginably of very old family and independent property, sails at the head of several smaller shad, his flatterers and toadies, who try to look like him. Mostly his expression is very severe; but in milder moments he offers a perverse resemblance to some portraits of Washington. All our days in Naples died like dolphins to the music which I have tried to impart the sense of. The joyful noises which it was made up of culminated for us on that evening when a company of the street and boat musicians came into the hotel and danced and sang and played the tarantella. They were of all ages, sexes, and bulks, and of divers operatic costumes, but they were of one temperament only, which was glad and childlike. They went through their repertory, which included a great deal more than the tarantella, and which we applauded with an enthusiasm attested by our contributions when the tambourine went round. Then they repeated their selections, and at the second collection we guests of the hotel repeated our contributions, but in a more guarded spirit. After the second repetition the prettiest girl came round with her photographs and sold them at prices out of all reason. Then we became very melancholy, and began to steal out one by one. I myself did not stay for the fourth collection, and I cannot report how the different points of view, the Southern and the Northern, were reconciled in the event which I am not sure was final. But I am sure that unless you can make allowance for a world-wide difference in the Neapolitans from yourself you can never understand them. Perhaps you cannot, even then. \\n\\nV. POMPEII REVISITED \\nBecause I felt very happy in going back to Pompeii after a generation, and being alive to do so in the body, I resolved to behave handsomely by the cabman who drove me from my hotel to the station. I said to myself that I would do something that would surprise him, and I gave him his fee and nearly a franc over; but it was I who was surprised, for he ran after me into the station, as I supposed, to extort more. He was holding out a franc toward me, and I asked the guide who was bothering me to take him to Pompeii (where there are swarms of guides always on the grounds) what the matter was. \\\"It is false,\\\" he explained, and this proved true, though whether the franc was the one I had given the driver or whether it was one which he had thoughtfully substituted for it to make good an earlier loss I shall now never know. I put it into my pocket, wondering what I should do with it; the question what you shall do with counterfeit money in Italy is one which is apt to recur as I have hinted, and in despair of solving it at the moment I threw the false franc out of the car-window; it was the false franc I have already boasted of throwing away. This was, of course, after I got into the car, and after I had suffered another wrong, and was resolved at least to be good myself. I had taken first-class tickets, but, when we had followed several conductors up and down the train, the last of them said there were no first-class places left, though I shall always doubt this. I asked what we should do, and he shrugged. I had heard that if you will stand upon your rights in such a matter the company will have to put on another car for you. But I was now dealing with the Italian government, which has nationalized the railroads, but has apparently not yet repleted the rolling stock; and when the conductor found us places in a second-class carriage, rather than quarrel with a government which had troubles enough already I got aboard. I suppose really that I have not much public spirit, and that the little I have I commonly leave at home; in travelling it is burdensome. Besides, the second-class carriage would have been comfortable enough if it had not been so dirty; it looked as if it had not been washed since it was flooded with liquid ashes at the destruction of Pompeii, though they seemed to be cigar ashes. The country through which we made the hour's run was sympathetically squalid. We had, to be sure, the sea on one side, and that was clean enough; but the day was gray, and the sea was responsively gray; while the earth on the other side was torn and ragged, with people digging manure into the patches of broccoli, and gardening away as if it had been April instead of January. There were shabby villas, with stone-pines and cypresses herding about the houses, and tatters of life-plant overhanging their shabby walls; there were stucco shanties which the men and women working in the fields would lurk in at nightfall. At places there was some cheerful boat building, and at one place there was a large macaroni manufactory, with far stretches of the product dangling in hanks and skeins from rows of trellises. We passed through towns where women and children swarmed, working at doorways and playing in the dim, cold streets; from the balconies everywhere winter melons hung in nets, dozens and scores of them, such as you can buy at the Italian fruiterers' in New York, and will keep buying when once you know how good they are. In Naples they sell them by the slice in the street, the fruiterer carrying a board on his head with the slices arranged in an upright coronal like the rich, barbaric head-dress of some savage prince. Our train was slow and our car was foul, but nothing could keep us from arriving at Pompeii in very good spirits. The entrance to the dead city is gardened about with a cemeterial prettiness of evergreens; but, after you have bought your ticket and been assigned your guide, you pass through this decorative zone and find yourself in the first of streets where the past makes no such terms with the present. If some of the houses of an ampler plan had little spaces beyond the atrium planted with such flowers as probably grew there two thousand years ago, and stuck round with tiny figurines, it was to the advantage of the people's fancy; but it did not appeal so much to the imagination as the mould and moss, and the small, weedy network that covered the ground in the roofless chambers and temples and basilicas, where the broken columns and walls started from the floors which this unmeditated verdure painted in the favorite hue of ruin. Most of the places I re-entered through my recollection of them, but to this subjective experience there was added that of seeing much newer and vaster things than I remembered. That sad population of the victims of the disaster, restored to the semhlance of life, or perhaps rather of death, in plaster casts taken from the moulds their decay had left in the hardening ashes, had much increased in the melancholy museum where one visits them the first thing within the city gates. But their effect was not cumulative; there were more writhing women and more contorted men; but they did not make their tragedy more evident than it had been when I saw them, fewer but not less affecting, all those years ago. It was the same with the city itself; Pompeii had grown, like the rest of the world in the interval, and, although it had been dug tip instead of built up, a good third had been added to the count of its streets and houses. There were not, so far as I could see, more ruts from chariot-wheels in the lava blocks of the thoroughfares, but some convincingly two-storied dwellings had been exhumed, and others with ceilings in better condition than those of the earlier excavations; there were more all-but-unbroken walls and columns; some mosaic floors were almost as perfect as when their dwellers fled over them out of the stifling city. But upon the whole the result was a greater monotony; the revelation of house after house, nearly the same in design, did not gain impressiveness from their repetition; just as the case would be if the dwellings of an old-fashioned cross-town street in New York were dug out two thousand years after their submergence by an eruption of Orange Mountain. The identity of each of the public edifices is easily attested to the archaeologist, but the generally intelligent, as the generally unintelligent, visitor must take the archaeologist's word for the fact. One temple is much like another in its stumps of columns and vague foundations and broken altars. Among the later discoveries certain of the public baths are in the best repair, both structurally and decoratively, and in these one could replace the antique life with the least wear and tear of the imagination. \\nI could not tell which the several private houses were; but the guide-books can, and there I leave the specific knowledge of them; their names would say nothing to the reader if they said nothing to me. In Pompeii, where all the houses were rather small, some of the new ones were rather large, though not larger than a few of the older ones. Not more recognizably than these, they had been devoted to the varied uses known to advanced civilization in all ages: there were dwellings, and taverns and drinking-houses and eating-houses, and there were those houses where the feet of them that abide therein and of those that frequent them alike take hold on hell. In these the guide stays the men of his party to prove the character of the places to them from the frescos and statues; but it may be questioned if the visitors so indulged had not better taken the guide's word for the fact. There can be no doubt that at the heart of paganism the same plague festered which poisons Christian life, and which, while the social conditions remain the same from age to age, will poison life forever. The pictures on the walls of the newly excavated houses are not strikingly better than those I had not forgotten; but of late it has been the purpose to leave as many of the ornaments and utensils in position as possible. The best are, as they ought to be, gathered into the National Museum at Naples, but those which remain impart a more living sense of the past than such wisely ordered accumulations; for it is the Pompeian paradox that in the image of death it can best recall life. It is a grave which has been laid bare, and it were best to leave its ghastly memories unhindered by other companionship. One feels that one ought to be there alone in order to see it aright. One should not perhaps \\\"Go visit it by the pale moonlight,\\\" but if one could have it all to one's self by day, such a gray day as we had for it, there is no telling what might happen. One thing only would certainly happen: one would get lost. It never was a town of large area; and, like all spaces that have been ruined over, it looked smaller than it would have looked if all its walls were standing with all their roofs upon them. Still, it was a mesh of streets, out of which you would in vain have sought your way if you had been caught in it alone; though it is mostly so level that if you had mounted a truncated column almost anywhere you could have looked over the labyrinth to its verge. It was not much crowded by visitors; though there were strings of them at the heels of the respective guides, with, I thought, a prevalence of the Germans, who are now overrunning Italy; I am sorry to say they are not able to keep it cheap, at least for other nationalities. Among these I noted two little smiling, shining, twinkling Japs, who carried kodaks for the capture of that classical antiquity which could never really belong to them. Their want of a pagan past in common with us may be what keeps us alien even more than the want of a common Christian tradition. \\\"The glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome\\\" could never mean to our brown companions what they meant to us; but they put on a polite air of being interested in the Graeco-Roman ruin, and were so gentle and friendly that one could almost feel they were fellow-men. Very likely they were; at any rate, until we are at war with them I shall believe so. \\nOur guide, whom we had really bought the whole use of at the gate, thriftily took on another party, with our leave, and it was pleasant to find that the American type from Utah was the same as from Ohio or Massachusetts; with all our differences we are the most homogeneous people under the sun, and likest a large family. We all frankly got tired at about the same time at the same place, and agreed that we had, without the amphitheatre, had enough when we ended at the Street of Tombs, where the tombs are in so much better repair than the houses. For myself, I remembered the amphitheatre so perfectly from 1864 that I did not see how I could add a single emotion there in 1908 to those I had already turned into literature; and though Pompeii is but small, the amphitheatre is practically as far from the Street of Tombs, after you have walked about the place for two hours, as the Battery is from High Bridge. There is no Elevated or Subway at Pompeii, and even the lines of public chariots, if such they were, which left those ruts in the lava pavements seem to have been permanently suspended after the final destruction in the year 79. We were not only very tired, but very hungry, and we asked our guide to take us back the shortest way. I suggested a cross-cut at one point, and he caught at the word eagerly, and wrote it in his note-book for future use. He also acted upon it instantly, and we cut across the back yards and over the kitchen areas of several absent citizens on our way back. Our guide was as good and true as it is in the nature of guides to be, but absolute goodness and truth are rather the attributes of American travellers; and you will not escape the small graft which the guides are so rigorously forbidden to practise. Pompeii is no longer in the keeping of the Italian army; with the Italian instinct of decentralization the place has claimed the right of self-government, and now the guides are civilians, and not soldiers, as they were in my far day. They do not accept fees, but still they take them; and our guide said that he had a brother-in-law who had the best restaurant outside the gate, where we could get luncheon for two francs. As soon as we were in the hands of the runner for that restaurant the price augmented itself to two francs and a half; when we mounted to the threshold, lured on by the fascinating mystery of this increase, it became three francs, without wine. But as the waiter justly noted, in hovering about us with the cutlery and napery while he laid the table, a two-fifty luncheon was unworthy such lords as we. When he began to bring on the delicious omelette, the admirable fish, the excellent cutlets, he made us observe that if we paid three francs we ought to eat a great deal; and there seemed reason in this; at any rate, we did so. The truth is, that luncheon was worth the money, and more; as for the Vesuvian wine, it had the rich red blood of the volcano in it, and it could not be bought in New York for half a franc the bottle, if at all; at thrice that sum in Naples it was not a third as good. If there had been anything to do after lunch except go to the train, we could not have done it, we were so spent with our two hours' walk through Pompeii, though the gray day had been rather invigorating. Certainly it was not so exhausting as that white-hot day forty-three years before when I had broiled over the same ground under the blazing sun of a Pompeian November. Yet the difference in the muscles and emotions of twenty-seven as against those of seventy told in favor of the white-hot day; and, besides that, in the time that had elapsed a much greater burden of antiquity had been added to the city than had accumulated in its history between the year 79 and the year 1864. During most of those centuries Pompeii had been dreamlessly sleeping under its ashes, but in the ensuing less than half a century it had wakefully, however unwillingly, witnessed such events as the failure of secession and the abolition of slavery, the unification of Italy and Germany, the fall of the Second Empire, the liberation of Cuba, and the acquisition of the Philippines, the exile of Richard Croker, the destruction of the Boer Republic, the rise and spread of the trusts, the purification of municipal politics, the invention of wireless telegraphy, and the general adoption of automobiling. These things, and others like them, had perhaps not aged Pompeii so much as they had aged me, but their subjective effect was the same, and upon the whole I was not altogether sorry to have added scarcely a new impression of the place to those I had been carrying for more than a generation. Quantitatively there were plenty of new impressions to be had; impressions of more roofs, gardens, columns, houses, temples, walls, frescos; but qualitatively the Greater Pompeii was now not different from the lesser which I remembered so well. This, at least, was what I said to myself on the ground and afterward in the National Museum at Naples, where most of the precious Pompeian things, new and old, are heaped up. They still make but a poor show there beside the treasures of Herculaneum, where the excavation of a few streets and houses has yielded costlier and lovelier things than all the lengths and breadths of Pompeii. But not for this would I turn against Pompeii at the last moment, as it were, though my second visit had not aesthetically enriched me beyond my first. I keep the vision of it under that gray January sky, with Vesuvius smokeless in the background, and the plan of the dead city, opener to the eye than ever it could have been in life, inscribed upon the broadly opened area of the gentle slopes within its gates. Whether one had not better known it dead than alive, one might not wish perhaps to say; but the place itself is curiously without pathos; Newport in ruins might not be touching; possibly all skeletons or even mummies are without pathos; and Pompeii is a skeleton, or at the most a mummy, of the past. Seeing what antiquity so largely was, however, one might be not only resigned but cheerful in the ef-facement of any particular piece of it; and for a help to this at Pompeii I may advise the reader to take with him a certain little guide-book, written in English by a very courageous Italian, which I chanced to find in Naples. Though it treats of the tragical facts with seriousness, it is not with equal gravity that one reads that sixteen years before the Vesuvian eruption \\\"the region had been shaken by strong sismic movements, which induced Pompei inhabitants to forsake precipitately their habitations. But being the amazement up, they got one's home again as soon as the earth was quiet and all fear and sadness went off by memory.\\\" Signs of the final disaster to follow were not wanting; the wells failed, the water-courses were crossed by currents of carbonic acid; \\\"the domestic animals were also very sensible of the approaching of the scourge; they lost the habitual vivacity, and having the food in disgust, had from time to time to complain with mournful wailings, without justified reasons.... The sky became of a thick darkness,... interrupted only by flashes of light which the lava reverberated, by the bloody gliding of the thunderbolts, by the incandescence of enormous projectiles, thrown to an incommensurable highness.... Death surprised the charming town; houses and streets became the tombs of the unhappies hit by an atrocious torture.\\\" The author's study of the life of Pompeii is notable for diction which, if there were logic in language, would be admirable English, for while yet in his mind it must have been \\\"very choice Italian.\\\" He tells us that \\\"Pompei's dwellings are surprising by their specific littleness,\\\" and explains that \\\"Pompei inhabitants, for the habitudes of the climate could allow, lived almost always to the open sky,\\\" just as the Naples inhabitants do now. \\\"They got home only to rest a little, to fulfill life wants, to be protected by bad weather. They spent much time during the day in forum, temples, thermes, tennis-court, or intervened to public sports, religious functions and meetings.... Few houses only had windows. The sunlight and ventilation to the ancients was given through empty spaces in the roofs.... Hoofs knocked under the weight of materials thrown out by Vesuvius; it is undoubted, however, that roofs were provided with covers or supported terraces. In the middle of the roofs was cut an overture through which air and light brought their benefits to the underlaid ambients.... Proprietor disposed the locals according to his own delight.... So that, there were bed, bath, dining, talking and game rooms.\\\" In the peristyle \\\"the ground was gardened, the area shared in flower beds, had narrow paths; herbs, flowers, shrubs were put with art well in order on flower beds, delighted from time to time by statues of various subjects,\\\" as may be noted in the actual restorations of some of the Pompeian houses. As for their spiritual life, \\\"Pompeian's religion, like by Roman people, was the Paganism. Deities were worshipped in the temples with prayers, sacrifices, vows, and festivities.... Banquets to the Deity were joined to prayers. In fact, dining tables were dressed near the altars, and all around them on dining beds, tricli-nari, placed Divinities statues as these were assembled to own account to the joyous banquet.\\\" Auspices or auguries \\\"gave interpretation to thunders, lightnings, winds, rain crashes, comets, or to bird songs and flights.... Horuspices inquired the divine will on the animal bowels, sacrificed to the altar; they took out further indications by fleshes and bowels flames when burnt on the altar.\\\" An important feature of Pompeian social life was the bath, which \\\"was one of the hospitality duty, and very often required in several religious functions.... Large and colossal edifices were quite furnished with all the necessary for care and sport. Besides localities for all kind of bath - cold, warm, steam bath - didn't want parks, alleys, and porticos in order to walk; lists rings for gymnastic exercises, conversation and reading rooms, localities for theatrical representations, swimming stations, localities for scientific disquisitions, moral and religious teachings. The most splendid art works adorned the ambient.\\\" When we pass to the popular amusements we are presented with the materials of pictures vividly realized in The Last Days of Pompeii, but somewhat faded since. \\\"In the beginning gladiators' rank was made by condemned to death slaves and war prisoners. Later also thoughtless young men, who had never learned an advantageous trade, became gladiators.\\\" In the arena they engaged in sham fights till the spectators demanded blood. Then, \\\"sometimes one provided one's self nets for wrapping up the adversary, who, hit by a trident much, frequently die. When the gladiator was deadly wounded, forsaking the arm, struck down and stretching the index, asked the people grace of life. The spectators decided up his destiny, turning the thumb to the breast, or toward the ground. The thumb turned toward the ground was the unlucky's death doom, and he had without fail the throat cut off.\\\" Such, dimly but unmistakably seen through our Italian author's well-reasoned English, were the ancient Pompeians; and, upon the whole, the visitor to their city could not wish them back in it. I preferred even those modern Pompeians who followed us so molestively to the train with bargains in postal-cards and coral. They are very alert, the modern Pompeians, to catch the note of national character, and I saw one of them pursuing an elderly American with a spread of hat-pins, primarily two francs each, and with the appeal, evidently studied from some fair American girl: \\\"Buy it, Poppa! Six for one franc. Oh, Poppa, buy it!\\\" I had again lavished my substance upon first-class tickets, and so had my Utah friend, who expounded his philosophy of travel as we managed to secure a first-class carriage. \\\"When I can't go first-class in Italy, I'll go home.\\\" I promptly and proudly agreed with him, but I concealed my morning's experience of the fact that in Italy you may sometimes go second class when you have paid first. I agreed with him, however, in not minding the plunder of Italian travel, since, with all the extortions, it would come to a third less than you expected to spend. His was the true American spirit. \\n\\nVI. ROMAN HOLIDAYS \\nI. HOTELS, PENSIONS, AND APARTMENTS \\n\\\"Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?\\\" the traveller asks rather anxiously than defiantly when he finds himself a stranger in a strange place, and he is apt to add, if he has not written or wired ahead to some specific hotel, \\\"Which of mine inns shall I take mine ease in?\\\" He is the more puzzled to choose the more inns there are to choose from, and his difficulty is enhanced if he has not considered that some of his inns may be full or may be too dear, and yet others undesirable. The run from Naples in four hours and a half had been so flattering fair an experience to people who had last made it in eight that they arrived in Rome on a sunny afternoon of January preoccupied with expectations of an instant ease in their inn which seemed the measure of their merit. They indeed found their inn, and it was with a painful surprise that they did not find the rooms in it which they wanted. There were neither rooms full south, nor over the garden, nor off the tram, and in these circumstances there was nothing for it but to drive to some one else's inn and try for better quarters there. They, in fact, drove to half a dozen such, their demands rising for more rooms and sunnier and quieter and cheaper, the fewer and darker and noisier and dearer were those they found. The trouble was that they found in the very first alien hotel where they applied an apartment so exactly what they wanted, with its four rooms and bath, all more or less full south, though mostly veering west and north, that they carried the fatal norm in their consciousness and tested all other apartments by it, the earlier notion of single rooms being promptly rejected after the sight of it. The reader will therefore not be so much, astonished as these travellers were to learn that there was nothing else in Rome (where there must be about five hundred hotels, hotels garnis, and pensions) that one could comparatively stay even overnight in, and that they settled in that alluring apartment provisionally, the next day being Sunday, and the crystalline Saturday of their arrival being well worn away toward its topaz and ruby sunset. Of course, they continued their search for several days afterward, zealously but hopelessly, yet not fruitlessly, for it resulted in an acquaintance with Roman hotels which they might otherwise never have made, and for one of them in literary material of interest to every one hoping to come to Rome or despairing of it. The psychology of the matter was very curious, and involved the sort of pleasing self-illusion by which people so often get themselves over questionable passes in life and come out with a good conscience, or a dead one, which is practically the same thing. These particular people had come to Rome with reminiscences of in-expensiveness and had intended to recoup themselves for the cost of several previous winters in New York hotels by the saving they would make in their Roman sojourn. When it appeared, after all the negotiation and consequent abatement, that their Roman hotel apartment would cost them hardly a fifth less than they had last paid in New York, they took a guilty refuge in the fact that they were getting for less money something which no money could buy in New York. Gradually all sense of guilt wore off, and they boldly, or even impudently, said to themselves that they ought to have what they could pay for, and that there were reasons, which they were not obliged to render in their frankest soliloquies, why they should do just what they chose in the matter. The truth is that the modern Roman hotel is far better in every way than the hotel of far higher class, or of the highest class, in New York. In the first place, the managers are in the precious secret, which our managers have lost, of making you believe that they want you; and, having you, they know how to look after your pleasure and welfare. The table is always of more real variety, though vastly less stupid profusion than ours. The materials are wholesomer and fresher and are without the proofs, always present in our hotel viands, of a probationary period in cold storage. As for the cooking, there is no comparison, whether the things are simply or complexly treated; and the service is of that neatness and promptness which ours is so ignorant of. Your agreement is usually for meals as well as rooms; the European plan is preferably ignored in Europe; and the table d'hote luncheon and dinner are served at small, separate tables; your breakfast is brought to your room. Being old-fashioned, myself, I am rather sorry for the small, separate tables. I liked the one large, long table, where you made talk with your neighbors; but it is gone, and much facile friendliness with it, on either hand and across the board. The rooms are tastefully furnished, and the beds are unquestionable; the carpets warmly cover the floor if stone, or amply rug it if of wood. The steam-heating is generous and performs its office of \\\"roasting you out of the house\\\" without the sizzling and crackling which accompany its efforts at home. The electricity really illuminates, and there is always an electric lamp at your bed-head for those long hours when your remorse or your digestion will not let you sleep, and you must substitute some other's waking dreams for those of your own slumbers. Above all, there is a lift, or elevator, not enthusiastically active or convulsively swift, but entirely practicable and efficient. It will hold from four to eight persons, and will take up at least six without reluctance. It must be clearly understood that the ideal of American comfort is fully and faithfully realized, and if the English have reformed the Italian hotels in respect of cleanliness, it is we who have brought them quite to our domestic level in regard to heat and light. But if we want these things in Rome, we must pay for them as we do at home, though still we do not pay so much as we pay at home. The tips are about half our average, but whether they are given currently or ultimately I do not know. Who, indeed, knows about others' tips anywhere in the world? I asked an experienced fellow-citizen what the custom was, and he said that he believed the English gave in going away, but he thought the spirits of the helpers drooped under the strain of hope deferred, and he preferred to give every week. The donations, I understood, were pooled by the dining-room waiters and then equally divided; but gifts bestowed above stairs were for the sole behoof of him or her who took them. Germans are said to give less than Anglo-Saxons, and it is said that Italians in some cases do not give at all. But, again, who knows? The Italians are said never to give drink money to the cabmen, but to pay only the letter of the tariff. If I had done that in driving about to look up worse hotels than the one I chose first and last, I should now be a richer man, but I doubt if a happier. Two cents seems to satisfy a Roman cabman; five cents has for him the witchery of money found in the road; but I must not leave the subject of hotels for that of cabs, however alluringly it beckons. The reader who knows Italy only from the past should clear his mind of his old impressions of the hotels. There is no longer that rivalry between the coming guest and the manager to see how few or many candles can be lighted in his room and charged in the bill; there are no longer candles, but only electricity. There is no longer an extortion for hearth-fires which send all the heat up the chimney; there are steam radiators in every room. There is no longer a tedious bargaining for rooms; the price is fixed and cannot be abated except for a sojourn of weeks or months. But the price is much greater than it used to be - twice as great almost; for the taxes are heavy and provisions are dear, and coal and electricity are costly, and you must share the expense with the landlord. He is not there for his health, and, if for your comfort, you are not his invited guest. As I have intimated, an apartment of four rooms with a bath will cost almost as much, with board, as the same quarters in New York, but you will get far more for your money in Rome. If you take a single room, even to the south, in many first-class Roman hotels it will cost you for room and board only two dollars or two and a half a day, which is what you pay for a far meaner and smaller room alone in New York; and the Roman board is such, as you can get at none but our most expensive houses for twice the money. Generally you cannot get a single room and bath, but at present a very exclusive hotel is going up in a good quarter which promises, with huge English signs, a bath with every room and every room full south. One does not see just how the universal sunny exposure is to be managed, but there can be no question of the baths; and, with the steam radiators everywhere, the northernmost room might well imagine itself full south. Nearly all the hotels have a pleasant tea-room, which is called a winter garden, because of a pair of palm-trees set under the centre of its glass roof and the painted bamboo chairs and tables set about. This sort of garden is found even in the hotels which are almost of the grade of pensions and of their prices; but generally the pensions proper are without it. Their rates are much lower, but quite as good people frequent them, and they are often found in good streets and sometimes open into or overlook charming gardens; the English especially seem to like the pensions, which are managed like hotels. They are commonly without steam-heat, which might account for their being less frequented by Americans. There are two supreme hotels in Rome - one in the Ludovisi quarter, as it is called, and the other near the Baths of Diocletian, which Americans frequent to their cost, for the rates approach a New York or London magnificence. The first is rather the more spectacular of the two and is the resort of all the finer sort of afternoon tea-drinkers, who find themselves the observed of observers of all nationalities; there is music and dress, and there are titles of every degree, with as much informality as people choose, if they go to look, or as much state if they go to be looked at; these things are much less cumbrously contrived than with us. The other hotel, I have the somewhat unauthorized fancy, is rather more addicted to very elect dinner-parties and suppers. Below these two are an endless variety of first-rate and second-rate houses, both in the newer quarter of the city, where the villa paths have been turned into streets, and in the old town on all the pleasant squares and avenues. There is a tradition of unhealth concerning the old town which the modern death-rate of Rome shows to be unjust; at the worst these places have more dark and damp, and the hotels are not steam-heated. It has seemed to me that there are not so many hotels garnis in Rome as there used to be in Italian cities, but they, too, abound in pleasant streets, and the stranger who has a fancy for lodgings with breakfast in his rooms, and likes to browse about for his luncheon and dinner, will easily suit himself. If it comes to taking a furnished apartment for the season, there is much range in price and much choice in place. The agents who have them to let will begin, rather dismayingly, \\\"Oh, apartments in Rome are very dear.\\\" But you learn on inquiry that a furnished flat in the Ludovisi region, in a house with a lift and full sun, may be had for two hundred dollars a month. From this height the rents of palatial apartments soar to such lonely peaks as eight hundred and sink to such levels as a hundred and twenty or a hundred; and for this you have linen and silver and all the movables and utensils you want, as well as several vast rooms opening wastefully from one to another till you reach the salon. The rents of the like flats, if vacant, would be a quarter or a third less, though again the agents begin by telling you that there is very little difference between the rents of furnished and unfurnished flats. The flats are in every part of the old town and the new; and some are in noble sixteenth and seventeenth century palaces, such as we are accustomed to at home only in the theatre. My own experience is that everybody, especially in houses where there are no lifts, lives on the top floor. You pass many other floors in going up, but you are left to believe that nobody lives on them. When you reach the inhabited levels, you find them charming inside for their state and beauty, and outside for their magnificent view, which may be pretty confidently relied upon to command the dome of St. Peter's. That magnificent stone bubble seems to blow all round the horizon. When you have taken your furnished flat, the same agency will provide you a cook at ten or twelve dollars a month, a maid at seven dollars, a lady's maid at eight or nine dollars, and so on; the cook will prefer to sleep out of the house. Then will come the question of provisions, and these seem really to be dear in Rome. Meats and vegetables both are dear, and game and poultry. Beef will be forty cents a pound, and veal and mutton in proportion; a chicken which has been banting for the table from its birth will be forty cents; eggs which have not yet taken active shape are twenty-five and thirty cents throughout winters so bland that a hen of any heart can hardly keep from laying every day. I am afraid I am no authority on butter and milk, and groceries I do not know the prices of; but coffee ought to be cheap, for nobody drinks anything but substitutes more or less unabashed. For the passing stranger, or even the protracted so-journer, whose time and money are not too much at odds, a hotel is best, and a hotel in the new quarter is pleasanter than one in the old quarters. Ours, at any rate, was in a wide, sunny, and (if I must own it) dusty street, laid out in a line of beauty on the borders of the former Villa Ludovisi, where the aging or middle-aging reader used to come to see Guercino's \\\"Aurora\\\" in the roof of the casino. Now all trace of the garden is hidden under vast and vaster hotels and great blond apartment-houses, and ironed down with trolley-rails; but the Guercino has been spared, though it is no longer so accessible to the public. Still, there is a garden left, and our hotel, with others, looks across the sun and dust of its street into the useful vegetation of the famous old Capuchin convent, with the church, to which I came so eagerly so long ago to revere Guido's \\\"St. Michael and the Dragon\\\" and the decorative bones of the good brothers braided on the walls and roofs of the crypt in the indissoluble community of floral and geometric designs. \\nAll through the months of February and March I woke to the bell that woke the brothers to their prayers before daybreak and burst the beauty-sleep of the hotel-dwellers, who have so far outnumbered the monks since the obliteration of the once neighboring villa. This was, of course, a hardship, and one thought things of that bell which the monks were too good to say; but being awake, and while one was reading one's self to sleep again, one could hear the beginning of the bird singing in the modern garden in the rear which followed upon the bell-ringing. I do not know what make or manner of bird it was that mostly sang among the palms and laurels and statues, but it had a note of liquid gold, which it poured till a certain flageo-lettist, whom I never saw, came to the corner under the villa wall and blew his soul into one end of his instrument and out of the other in the despondent breathings of most melancholy music. Then, having attuned the spirits of his involuntary listeners to a pensive sympathy, he closed with that international hymn which does not rightly know whether it is \\\"My Country, 'tis of Thee,\\\" or \\\"God Save the King,\\\" but serves equally for the patriotism of any English or Americans in hearing. I do not know why this harmless hymn, which the flageolettist gave extremely well, should always have seemed to provoke the derision of the donkey which apparently dwelt in harmony with the birds in that garden, but the flageolettist had no sooner ended than the donkey burst into a bray, loud, long, and full of mockery, with a close of ironical whistling and most insolent hissing; you would think that some arch-enemy of the Anglo-Saxon race was laughing the new-felt unity of the English and Americans to scorn. Later, but still before daylight, came the wild cry of a boy, somewhere out of perdition, following the deep bass invitation of his father's lost spirit to buy his wares, whatever they were. We never knew, but we liked that boy's despairing wail, and would not have missed it for ever so much extra slumber. When all hope of more sleep was past there was no question of the desirability of the boy who visibly arranged his store of oranges on the curbstone under the villa wall, and seemed to think that they had a peculiar attraction from being offered for sale in pairs. His cry filled the rest of the forenoon. The Italian spring comes on slowly everywhere, with successive snubs in its early ardor from the snows on the mountains, which regulate the climate from north to south. We could not see that it made more speed behind the sheltering walls of the Capuchin convent garden than in other places. The old gardener whom we saw pottering about in it seemed to potter no more actively at the end of March than at the beginning of February; on the first days of April a heap of old leaves and stalks was sending up the ruddy flame and pleasant smell that the like burning heaps do with us at the like hour of spring - in fact, vegetation had much more reason to be cheerful throughout February than at any time in March. Those February days were really incomparable. They had not the melting heat of the warm spells that sometimes come in our Februaries; but their suns were golden, and their skies unutterably blue, and their airs mild, yet fresh. You always wanted a heavy coat for driving or for the shade in walking; otherwise the temperature was that of a New England April which was resolved to begin as it could carry out. But March came with cold rains of whole days, and with suns that might overheat but could not be trusted to warm you. The last Sunday of January I found ice in the Colosseum; but that was the only time I saw ice anywhere in Rome. In March, however, in a moment of great exasperation from the mountains, it almost snowed. Yet that month would in our climate have been remembered for its beauty and for a prevailing kindness of temperature. The worst you could say of it was that it left the spring in the Capuchin garden where it found it. But possibly, since the temporal power was overthrown, the seasons are neglected and indifferent. Certainly man seems so in the case of the Capuchin convent. Great stretches of the poor old plain edifice look vacant, and the high wall which encloses it is plastered and painted with huge advertisements of clothiers and hotels and druggists, and announcements of races and other events out of keeping with its character and tradition. The sentimentalists who overrun Rome from all the Northern lands will tell you that this is of a piece with all the Newer Rome which has sprung into existence since the Italian occupation. Their griefs with the thing that is are loud and they are long; but I, who am a sentimentalist too, though of another make, do not share them. No doubt the Newer Rome has made mistakes, but, without defending her indiscriminately, I am a Newer-Roman to the core, perhaps because I knew the Older Rome and what it was like; and not all my brother and sister sentimentalists can say as much. \\n\\nII. A PRAISE OF NEW ROME \\nRome and I had both grown older since I had seen her last, but she seemed not to show so much as I the forty-three years that had passed. Naturally a city that was already twenty-seven centuries of age (and no one knows how much more) would not betray the lapse of time since 1864 as a man must who was then only twenty-seven years of age. In fact, I should say that Rome looked, if anything, younger at our second meeting, in 1908, or, at any rate, newer; and I am so warm a friend of youth (in others) that I was not sorry to find Rome young, or merely new, in so many good things. At the same time I must own that I heard no other foreigner praising her for her newness except a fellow-septuagenarian, who had seen Rome earlier even than I, and who thought it well that the Ghetto should have been cleared away, though some visitors, who had perhaps never lived in a Ghetto, thought it a pity if not a shame, and an incalculable loss to the picturesque. These also thought the Tiber Embankments a wicked sacrifice to the commonplace, though the mud-banks of other days invited the torrent to an easy overflow of whole quarters of the town, which were left reeking with the filth of the flood that overlay the filth of the streets, and combined with it to an effect of disease and of discomfort not always personally unknown to the lover of the picturesque. There used to be a particular type of typhoid known as Roman fever, but now quite unknown, thanks to the Tiber Embankments and to the light and air let into the purlieus of that mediaeval Rome for which the injudicious grieve so loudly. The perfect municipal housekeeping of our time leaves no darkest and narrowest lane or alley unswept; every morning the shovel and broom go over the surfaces formerly almost impassable to the foot and quite impossible to the nose. I am speaking literally as well as frankly, and though I can understand why some envious New-Yorker, remembering our blackguard streets and avenues, should look askance at the decency of the newer Rome and feign it an offence against beauty and poetry, I do not see why a Londoner, who himself lives in a well-kept town, should join with any of my fellow-barbarians in hypocritically deploring the modern spirit which has so happily invaded the Eternal City. The Londoner should rather entreat us not to be humbugs and should invite us to join him in rejoicing that the death-rate of Rome, once the highest in the civilized world, is now almost the lowest. But the language of Shakespeare and Milton is too often internationally employed in deploring the modernity which has housed us aliens there in such perfect comfort and safety. One must confine one's self to instances, and one may take that of the Ludovisi Quarter, as it is called, where I dwelt in so much peace and pleasure except when I was reminded that it was formed by plotting the lovely Villa Ludovisi in house lots and building it up in attractive hotels and apartment-houses. Even then I did not suffer so keenly as some younger people, who had never seen the villa, seemed to do, though there are still villas to burn in and about Rome, and they could not really miss the Ludovisi. It was a pretty place, but not beyond praise, and the quarter also is pretty, though also not beyond praise. The villa was for the pleasure and pride of one family, but it signified, even in its beauty, nothing but patrician splendor, which is a poor thing at best; and the quarter is now for the pleasure and pride of great numbers of tourists, mostly of that plutocracy from which a final democracy is inevitably to evolve itself. I could see no cause to beat the breast in this; and in humbler instances, even to very humble, I could not find that things were nearly as bad in Rome as they have been painted. There is no doubt but at one time, directly after the coming of the capital, Rome was badly overbuilt. There is no doubt, also, that Rome has grown up to these rash provisions for her growth, and that she now \\\"stuffs out her vacant garments with her form\\\" pretty fully. One must not say that all the flats in all the houses are occupied, but most of them are; and if now the property of the speculators is the property of the banks, the banks are no bad landlords, and the law does not spare them the least of their duties to their tenants; or so, at least, it is said. Another typical wrong to the old Rome, or rather to the not-yet Rome, was the building-up, beyond the Tiber, of the Quarter of the Fields, so called, where Zola in his novel of Rome has placed most of the squalor which he so lavishly employs in its contrasts. In these he shows himself the romanticist that he always frankly owned he was in spite of himself; but after I had read his book I made it my affair to visit the scenes of poverty and misery in the Quartiere dei Prati. When I did so I found that I had already passed through the quarter without noting anything especially poor or specifically miserable, and I went a third time to make sure that I had not overlooked something impressively lamentable. But I did not see above three tenement-houses with the wash hung from the windows, and with the broken shutters of poverty and misery, in a space where on the East Side or the North Side in New York I could have counted such houses by the score, almost the hundred. In this quarter the streets were swept every morning as they are everywhere in Rome, and though toward noon they were beginning to look as slovenly as our streets look when they have just been \\\"cleaned,\\\" I knew that the next morning these worst avenues of Rome would be swept as our best never have been since the days of Waring. Beyond the tenements the generous breadth of the new streets has been bordered by pleasant stucco houses of the pretty Italian type, fleetingly touched but not spoiled by the taste of the art nouveau, standing in their own grounds, and not so high-fenced but one could look over their garden-walls into the shrubs and flowers about them. Like suburban effects are characteristic of the new wide residential streets on the hither side of the Tiber, and on both shores the streets expand from time to time into squares, with more or less tolerable new monuments - say, of the Boston average - in them. The business streets where they bear the lines of the frequently recurrent trams are spacious and straight, and though they are not the Corso, the Corso itself, it must be remembered, is only a street of shops by no means impressive, and is mostly dim under the overtowering walls of palaces which have no space to be dignified in. Now and then their open portals betray a glimpse of a fountained or foliaged court, but whether these palaces are outwardly beautiful or not no one can tell from what sight one can get of them; no, not even the most besotted sentimentalist of those who bewail the loss of mediaeval Rome when they mean Rome of the Renaissance. How much of that Rome has been erased by modern Rome I do not know, but I think not so much as people pretend. Some of the ugly baroque churches have been pulled down to allow the excavation of imperial Rome, but there are plenty of ugly baroque churches left. It is said the princely proprietors of the old palaces which are let in apartments along the different Corsos (for the Corso is several) are going to pull them down and put up modern houses, with the hope of modern rents, but again I do not know. More than once the fortuities of hospitality found one the guest of dwellers in such stately domiciles, and I could honestly share the anxiety with which they spoke of these rumors; but there are a great many vast edifices of the sort, and I should not be surprised if I went back to Rome after another forty-three years to find most of them standing in 1951 where they now stand in 1908. Rome was not built in a day, and it will not be unbuilt or rebuilt within the brief period that will make me one hundred and fourteen years old. By that time I shall have outlived most of the medievalists, and I can say to the few survivors: \\\"There, you see that new Rome never went half so far as you expected.\\\" But no doubt it will go further than it has yet gone, in the way that is for the good and comfort of mankind. In one of the newer quarters, of which the Baths of Diocletian form the imperial centre, my just American pride was flattered by the sign on a handsome apartment-house going up in gardened grounds, which advertised that it was to be finished with a lift and steam-heating. Many of the newer houses are already supplied with lifts, but central heating is as yet only beginning to spread from the hotels, where steam has been installed in compliance with the impassioned American demand to be warm all round when one is in-doors. New Rome is not going so fast and so far but that it will keep, to whatever end it reaches, one of the characteristic charms of the old and older Rome. I shall expect to see when I come back in 1951 the same or the like corners of garden walls, with the tops of shining foliage peering over them, that now enchant the passer in the street; from the windows of my electric-elevatored, steam-heated apartment I shall look down into the seclusion of gardens, with the golden globes of orange espaliers mellowing against the walls, and the fountain in the midst of oleanders and of laurels \\\"Shaking its loosened silver in the sun.\\\" Slim cypresses will then as now blacken through the delicate air against the blue sky, and a stone-pine will spread its umbrella over some sequestered nook. By that time the craze for the eucalyptus which now possesses all Italy will be over, and every palm-tree will be cut down, while the ilex will darken in its place and help the eternal youth of the marbles to a greener old age of moss and mould in the gloom of its spreading shade. All these things beautifully abound in Rome now, as they always have abounded, and there is no reason to fear that they will cease to abound. Rome grows, and as Italy prospers it will grow more and more, for there must forever be a great and famous capital where there has always been one. The place is so perfectly the seat of an eternal city that it might well seem to have been divinely chosen because of the earth and heaven which are more in sympathy there than anywhere else in the world. The climate is beyond praise for a winter which is mild without being weak; there is a summer of tolerable noonday heat, and of nights deliciously cool; the spring is scarcely earlier than in our latitudes, but the fall is a long, slow decline from the temperature of October to the lowest level of January without the vicissitudes of other autumns. The embrowning or reddening or yellowing leaves turn sere, but drop or cling to their parent boughs as they choose, for there is seldom a frost to loosen their hold, and seldom a storm to tear them away. So it is said by those who profess a more intimate acquaintance with the Roman meteorology than I can boast, but from the little I know I can believe anything of it that is of good report. Everywhere the prevalence of the ilex, the orange, the laurel, the pine, flatters January with an illusion of June, and under our hotel windows I was witness of the success of the sycamore leaves in keeping a grip of their native twigs even after the new buds came to push them away. In the last days of March a plum-tree hung its robe of white blossoms over the wall of the Capuchin convent from the garden within; but the almond-trees had been in bloom for six weeks before, and the deeper pink of the peach had more warmly flushed the suburbs for fully a fortnight. Still, a mild winter and an endurable summer will not of themselves make a great capital, and it was probably the Romans themselves who in the past made Rome the capital of the world, first politically and then religiously. Whether they will make it so hereafter remains to be seen. In the sense of all the Italians being Romans, I believe, with my profound faith in the race, that they are very capable of doing it; and they will have the help of the whole world in the work, or what is most liberal and enlightened in the whole world. As it is, Rome has a pull with Occidental civilization which forever constitutes her its head city. The only European capitals comparable with her are London, Paris, and Berlin; one cannot take account of New York, which is merely the commercial metropolis of America, with a possibility of becoming the business centre of both hemispheres. Washington is still in its nonage and of a numerical unimportance in which it must long remain almost ludicrously inferior to other capitals, not to dwell upon its want of anything like artistic, literary, scientific, and historical primacy. It is the voluntary political centre of the greatest republic of any time and of a nation which is already unrivalled in its claim upon the future. But it is not of the involuntary and unconscious growth of a capital like London, which is the centre of a mighty state, deep-rooted in the past, and the capital of that Anglo-Saxon race of which we are ourselves a condition, and of a colonial empire without a present equal. Paris is France in the sense of representing the intense life of a nation unsurpassed in the things which enlighten and ennoble the human intellect and advance mankind. Berlin is the concentration of the strong will of a state which has made itself great out of the weak will of sundry inferior states, homogeneous in their disunity more than in any positive quality, and which stands for a political ideal more nearly reactionary, more nearly mediaeval, than any other modern state. Berlin is not German as Paris is French, and Rome is not so exclusively Italian. In fact, her greatness, accomplished and destined, lies in just the fact that she is not and never can be exclusively Italian. Human interests too universal and imperative for the control of a single race, even so brilliant and so gifted as the Italian race, which is naturally and necessarily in possession, centre about her through history, religion, art, and make every one at home in the city which is the capital of Christendom. Now and then I saw some shining and twinkling Japs going about with Baedekers, and I imagined them giving a modest and unprejudiced mind to Rome without claiming, tacitly or explicitly, the right to dispute the Italian theory and practice in its control. But every Occidental stranger (if any one of European blood is a stranger in the home of Christianity) I knew to be there in a mood more or less critical, and in a disposition to find fault with the Rome which is now making, or making over. \\nWe journeyers or sojourners can do this without expense or inconvenience to ourselves, and we can easily blame the Italian conception of the future city which, to name but one fact, has made it possible for us to visit her in comfort at every season and to come away without having come down with the Roman fever. In spite of the sort of motherly, or at the worst step-motherly, welcome which she gives to all us closely or distantly related children of hers; in spite of her immemorial fame and her immortal beauty; in spite of her admirable housekeeping, in which she rises every morning at daybreak and sweeps clean every hole and corner of her dwelling; in spite of her wonderful sky, her life-giving air; in spite of the level head she keeps in her political affairs, and the miraculous poise she maintains between the antagonism of State and Church; in spite of her wise eclecticism in modern improvements; in spite of her admirable hygiene, which has constituted her one of the healthiest, if not the healthiest city in Europe; in spite of the solvency which she preserves amid expenses to which the vast scale of antiquity obliges her in all her public enterprises (a thing to be hereafter studied), we, the ungracious offspring of her youth, come from our North and West and censure and criticise and carp. I have seldom conversed with any fellow-visitor in Rome who could not improve her in some phase or other, who could not usefully advise her, who, at the best, did not patronize her. I offer myself as almost the sole example of a stranger who was contented with her as she is, or as she is going to be without his help; and I am the more confident, therefore, in suggesting to Rome an expedient by which she can repair the finances which her visitors say are so foolishly and wastefully mismanaged in her civic schemes. A good round tax, such as Carlsbad levies upon all sojourners, if laid upon the multitudinous tourists joining in such a chorus of criticism of Rome would give them the indefeasible right to their opinions and would help to replete a treasury which they believe is always in danger of being exhausted. \\n\\nIII. THE COLOSSEUM AND THE FORUM \\nAs I have told, the first visit I paid to the antique world in Rome was at the Colosseum the day after our arrival. For some unknown reason I was going to begin with the Baths of Caracalla, but, as it happened, these were the very last ruins we visited in Rome; and I do not know just what accident diverted us to the Colosseum; perhaps we stopped because it was on the way to the Baths and looked an easier conquest. At any rate, I shall never regret that we began with it. After twoscore years and three it was all strangely familiar. I do not say that in 1864 there was a horde of boys at the entrance wishing to sell me postcards - these are a much later invention of the Enemy - but I am sure of the men with trays full of mosaic pins and brooches, and looking, they and their wares, just as they used to look. The Colosseum itself looked unchanged, though I had read that a minion of the wicked Italian government had once scraped its flowers and weeds away and cleaned it up so that it was perfectly spoiled. But it would take a good deal more than that to spoil the Colosseum, for neither the rapine of the mediaeval nobles, who quarried their palaces from it, nor the industrial enterprise of some of the popes, who wished to turn it into workshops, nor the archeology of United Italy had sufficed to weaken in it that hold upon the interest proper to the scene of the most stupendous variety shows that the world has yet witnessed. The terrible stunts in which men fought one another for the delight of other men in every manner of murder, and wild beasts tore the limbs of those glad to perish for their faith, can be as easily imagined there as ever, and the traveller who visits the place has the assistance of increasing hordes of other tourists in imagining them. I will not be the one to speak slight of that enterprise which marshals troops of the personally conducted through the place and instructs them in divers languages concerning it. Save your time and money so, if you have not too much of either, and be one of an English, French, or German party, rather than try to puzzle the facts out for yourself, with one contorted eye on your Baedeker and the other on the object in question. In such parties a sort of domestic relation seems to grow up through their associated pleasures in sight-seeing, and they are like family parties, though politer and patienter among themselves than real family parties. They are commonly very serious, though they doubtless all have their moments of gayety; and in the Colosseum I saw a French party grouped for photography by a young woman of their number, who ran up and down before them with a kodak and coquettishly hustled them into position with pretty, bird-like chirpings of appeal and reproach, and much graceful self-evidencing. I do not censure her behavior, though doubtless there were ladies among the photographed who thought it overbold; if the reader had been young and blond and svelte, in a Parisian gown and hat, with narrow russet shoes, not too high-heeled for good taste, I do not believe he would have been any better; or, if he would, I should not have liked him so well. On the earlier day which I began speaking of I found that I was insensibly attaching myself to an English-hearing party of the personally conducted, in the dearth of my own recollections of the local history, but I quickly detached myself for shame and went back and meekly hired the help of a guide who had already offered his services in English, and whom I had haughtily spurned in his own tongue. His English, though queer, was voluminous; but I am not going to drag the reader at our heels laden with lore which can be applied only on the spot or in the presence of postal-card views of the Colosseum. It is enough that before my guide released us we knew where was the box of Caesar, whom those about to die saluted, and where the box of the Vestals whose fatal thumbs gave the signal of life or death for the unsuccessful performer; where the wild beasts were kept, and where the Christians; where were the green-rooms of the gladiators, who waited chatting for their turn to go on and kill one another. One must make light of such things or sink under them; and if I am trying to be a little gay, it is for the readers' sake, whom I would not have perish of their realization. Our guide spared us nothing, such was his conscience or his science, and I wish I could remember his name, for I could commend him as most intelligent, even, when least intelligible. However, the traveller will know him by the winning smile of his rosy-faced little son, who follows him round and is doubtless bringing himself up as the guide of coming generations of tourists. There had been a full pour of forenoon sunshine on the white dust of the street before our hotel, but the cold of the early morning, though it had not been too much for the birds that sang in the garden back of us, had left a skim of ice in damp spots, and now, in the late gray of the afternoon, the ice was visible and palpable underfoot in the Colosseum, where crowds of people wandered severally or collectively about in the half-frozen mud. They were, indeed, all over the place, up and down, in every variety of costume and aspect, but none were so picturesque as a little group of monks who had climbed to a higher tier of the arches and stood looking down into the depths where we looked up at them, denned against the sky in their black robes, which opened to show their under robes of white. They were picturesque, but they were not so monumental as an old, unmistakable American in high-hat, with long, drooping side-whiskers, not above a purple suspicion of dye, who sat on a broken column and vainly endeavored to collect his family for departure. Whenever he had gathered two or three about him they strayed off as the others came up, and we left him sardonically patient of their adhesions and defections, which seemed destined to continue indefinitely, while we struggled out through the postal-card boys and mosaic-pin men to our carriage. Then we drove away through the quarter of somewhat jerry-built apartment-houses which neighbor the Colosseum, and on into the salmon sunset which, after the gray of the afternoon, we found waiting us at our hotel, with the statues on the balustrated wall of the villa garden behind it effectively posed in the tender light, together with the eidolons of those picturesque monks and that monumental American. \\nWe could safely have stayed longer, for the evening damp no longer brings danger of Roman fever, which people used to take in the Colosseum, unless I am thinking of the signal case of Daisy Miller. She, indeed, I believe, got it there by moonlight; but now people visit the place by moonlight in safety; and there are even certain nights of the season advertised when you may see it by the varicolored lights of the fireworks set off in it. My impression of it was quite vivid enough without that, and the vision of the Colosseum remained, and still remains, the immense skeleton of the stupendous form stripped of all integumental charm and broken down half one side of its vast oval, so that wellnigh a quarter of the structural bones are gone. \\nWith its image there persisted and persists the question constantly recurrent in the presence of all the imperial ruins, whether imperial Rome was not rather ugly than otherwise. The idea of those world-conquerors was first immensity and then beauty, as much as could survive consistently with getting immensity into a given space. The question is most of all poignant in the Forum, which I let wait a full fortnight before moving against it in the warm sun of an amiable February morning. On my first visit to Rome I could hardly wait for day to dawn after my arrival before rushing to the Cow Field, as it was then called, and seeing the wide-horned cattle chewing the cud among the broken monuments now so carefully cherished and, as it were, sedulously cultivated. It is doubtful whether all that has since been done, and which could not but have been done, by the eager science as much involuntarily as voluntarily applied to the task, has resulted in a more potent suggestion of what the Forum was in the republican or imperial day than what that simple, old, unassuming Cow Field afforded. There were then as now the beautiful arches; there were the fragments of the temple porches, with their pillars; there was the \\\"unknown column with the buried base\\\"; there were all the elements of emotion and meditation; and it is possible that sentiment has only been cumbered Avith the riches which archaeology has dug up for it by lowering the surface of the Cow Field fifteen or twenty feet; by scraping clean the buried pavements; by identifying the storied points; by multiplying the fragments of basal or columnar marbles and revealing the plans of temples and palaces and courts and tracing the Sacred Way on which the magnificence of the past went to dusty death. After all, the imagination is very childlike, and it prefers the elements of its pleas-ures simple and few; if the materials are very abundant or complex, it can make little out of them; they embarrass it, and it turns critical in self-defence. The grandeur that was Rome as visioned from the Cow Field becomes in the mind's eye the kaleidoscopic clutter which the resurrection of the Forum Romanum must more and more realize. If the visitor would have some rash notion of what the ugliness of the place was like when it was in its glory, he may go look at the plastic reconstruction of it, indefinitely reduced, in the modest building across the way from the official entrance to the Forum. One cannot say but this is intensely interesting, and it affords the consolation which the humble (but not too humble) spirit may gather from witness of the past, that the fashion of this world and the pride of the eyes and all ruthless vainglory defeated themselves in ancient Rome, as they must everywhere when they can work their will. If one had thought that in magnitude and multitude some entire effect of beauty was latent, one had but to look at that huddle of warring forms, each with beauty in it, but beauty lost in the crazy agglomeration of temples and basilicas and columns and arches and statues and palaces, incredibly painted and gilded, and huddled into spaces too little for the least, and crowding severally upon one another, without relation or proportion. Their mass is supremely tasteless, almost senseless; that mob of architectural incongruities was not only without collective beauty, but it was without that far commoner and cheaper thing which we call picturesqueness. This has come to it through ruin, and we must give a new meaning to the word vandalism if we would appreciate what the barbarians did for Rome in tumbling her tawdry splendor into the heaps which are now at least paint-able. Imperial Rome as it stood was not paintable; I doubt if it would have been even photographable to anything but a picture post-card effect. But as yet I wandered in the Forum safe from the realization of its ugliness when it was in its glory. I cannot say that even now it is picturesque, but it is paintable, and certainly it is pathetic. Stumps of columns, high and low, stand about in the places where they stood in their unbroken pride, and though it seems a hardship that they should not have been left lying in the kindly earth or on it instead of being pulled up and set on end, it must be owned that they are scarcely overworked in their present postures. More touching are those inarticulate heaps, cairns of sculptured fragments, piled here and there together and waiting the knowledge which is some time to assort them and translate them into some measure of coherent meaning. But it must always be remembered that when they were coherent they were only beautiful parts of a whole that was brutally unbeautiful. We have but to use the little common-sense which Heaven has vouchsafed some of us in order to realize that Rome, either republican or imperial, was a state for which we can have no genuine reverence, and that mostly the ruins of her past can stir in us no finer emotion than wonder. But necessarily, for the sake of knowledge, and of ascertaining just what quantity and quality of human interest the material records of Roman antiquity embody, archaeology must devote itself with all possible piety to their recovery. The removal, handful by handful, of the earth from the grave of the past which the whole Forum is, tomb upon tomb, is as dramatic a spectacle as anything one can well witness; for that soil is richer than any gold-mine in its potentiality of treasure, and it must be strictly scrutinized, almost by particles, lest some gem of art should be cast aside with the accumulated rubbish of centuries. Yet this drama, poignantly suggestive as it always must be, was the least incident of that morning in the Forum which it was my fortune to pass there with other better if not older tourists as guest of the Genius Loci. It was not quite a public event, though the Commendatore Boni is so well known to the higher journalism, and even to fiction (as the reader of Anatole France's La Pierre Blanche will not have forgotten), that nothing which he archaeologically does is without public interest, and this excursion in the domain of antiquity was expected to result in identifying the site of the Temple of Jupiter Stator. It was conjectured that the temple vowed to this specific Jupiter for his public spirit in stopping the flight of a highly demoralized Roman army would be found where we actually found it. Archaeology seems to proceed by hypothesis, like other sciences, and to enjoy a forecast of events before they are actually accomplished. I do not say that I was very vividly aware of the event in question; I could not go now and show where the temple stood, but when I read of it in a cablegram to the American newspapers I almost felt that I had dug it up with my own hands. \\nOf many other facts I was at the time vividly aware: of the charm of finding the archaeologist in an upper room of the mediaeval church which is turning itself into his study, of listening to his prefatory talk, so informal and so easy that one did not realize how learned it was, and then of following him down to the scene of his researches and hearing him speak wisely, poetically, humorously, even, of what he believed he had reason to expect to find. We stood with him by the Arch of Titus and saw how the sculptures had been broken from it in the fragments found at its base, and how the carved marbles had been burned for lime in the kiln built a few feet off, so that those who wanted the lime need not have the trouble of carrying the sculptures away before burning them. A handful of iridescent glass from a house-drain near by, where it had been thrown by the servants after breaking it, testified of the continuity of human nature in the domestics of all ages. A somewhat bewildering suggestion of the depth at which the different periods of Rome underlie one another spoke from the mouth of the imperial well or cistern which had been sunk on the top of a republican well or cistern at another corner of the arch. In a place not far off, looking like a potter's clay pit, were graves so old that they seem to have antedated the skill of man to spell any record of himself; and in the small building which seems the provisional repository of the archaeologist's finds we saw skeletons of the immemorial dead in the coffins of split trees still shutting them imperfectly in. Mostly the bones and bark were of the same indifferent interest, but the eternal pathos of human grief appealed from what mortal part remained of a little child, with beads on her tattered tunic and an ivory bracelet on her withered arm. History in the presence of such world-old atomies seemed an infant babbling of yesterday, in what it could say of the Rome of the Popes, the Rome of the Emperors, the Rome of the Republicans, the Rome of the Kings, the Rome of the Shepherds and Cowherds, through which a shaft sunk in the Forum would successively pierce in reaching those aboriginals whose sepulchres alone witnessed that they had ever lived. It is the voluble sorrow common to all the emotional visitors in Rome that the past of the different generations has not been treated by the present with due tenderness, and the Colosseum is a case notoriously in point. But, if it was an Italian archaeologist who destroyed the wilding growths in the Colosseum and scraped it to a bareness which nature is again trying to clothe with grass and weeds, it ought to be remembered that it is another Italian archaeologist who has set laurels all up and down the slopes of the Forum, and has invited roses and honeysuckles to bloom wherever they shall not interfere with science, but may best help repair the wounds he must needs deal the soil in researches which seem no mere dissections, but feats of a conservative, almost a constructive surgery. It is said that the German archaeologists objected to those laurels where the birds sing so sweetly; perhaps they thought them not strictly scientific; but when the German Kaiser, who always knows so much better than all the other Germans put together, visited the Forum, he liked them, and he parted from the Genius Loci with the imperial charge, \\\"Laurels, laurels, evermore laurels.\\\" After that the emotional tourist must be hard indeed to please who would begrudge his laurels to Commendatore Boni, or would not wish him a perpetual crown of them. \\n\\nIV. THE ANGLO-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SPANISH STEPS \\nIt is not every undeserving American who can have the erudition and divination of the Genius Loci in answer to his unuttered prayer during a visit to even a small part of the Roman Forum. But failing the company of the Commendatore Boni, which is without price, there are to be had for a very little money the guidance and philosophy, and, for all I know, the friendship of several peripatetic historians who lead people about the ruins in Rome, and instruct them in the fable, and doubtless in the moral, of the things they see. If I had profited by their learning, so much greater, or at least securer, than any the average American has about him, I should now be tiring the reader with knowledge which I am so willingly leaving him to imagine in me. If he is like the average American, he has really once had some nodding acquaintance with the facts, but history is apt to forsake you on the scene of it, and to come lagging back when it is too late. In this psychological experience you feel the need of help which the peripatetic historian supplies to the groups of perhaps rather oblivious than ignorant tourists of all nations in all languages, but preferably English. We Anglo-Saxons seem to be the most oblivious or most ignorant; but I would not slight our occasionally available culture any more than I would imply that those peripatetic historians are at all like the cicerones whom they have so largely replaced. I believe they are instructed and scholarly men; I offer them my respect; and I wish now that I had been one of their daily disciples, for it is full sixty years since I read Goldsmith's History of Rome. As I saw them, somewhat beyond earshot, they and their disciples formed a spectacle which was always interesting, and, so far as the human desire for information is affecting, was also affecting. The listeners to the lecturers would carry back to their respective villages and towns, or the yet simpler circles of our ordinary city lift, vastly more association with the storied scene than I had brought to it or should bring away. In fact, there is nothing more impressive in the floating foreign society of Rome than its zeal for self-improvement. No one classes himself with his fellow-tourists, though if he happens to be a traveller he is really one of them; and it is with difficulty I keep myself from the appearance of patronizing them in these praises, which are for the most part reverently meant. Their zeal never seemed to be without knowledge, whatever their age or sex; the intensity of their application reached to all the historical and actual interests, to the religious as well as the social, the political as well as the financial; but, fitly in Rome, it seemed specially turned to the study of antiquity, in the remoter or the nearer past. There was given last winter a series of lectures at the American School of Archaeology by the head of it, which were followed with eager attention by hearers who packed the room. But these lectures, which were so admirably first in. the means of intelligent study, seemed only one of the means by which my fellow-tourists were climbing the different branches of knowledge. All round my apathy I felt, where I did not see, the energy of the others; with my mind's ear I heard a rustle as of the turning leaves of Baedekers, of Murrays, of Hares, and of the many general histories and monographs of which these intelligent authorities advised the supplementary reading. If I am not so mistaken as I might very well be, however, the local language is less studied than it was in former times, when far fewer Italians spoke English. My own Italian was of that date; but, though I began by using it, I found myself so often helped for a forgotten meaning that I became subtly demoralized and fell luxuriously into the habit of speaking English like a native of Rome. Yet tacitly, secretly perhaps, there may have been many people who were taking up Italian as zealously as many more were taking up antiquity. One day in the Piazza di Spagna, in a modest little violet of a tea-room, which was venturing to open in the face of the old-established and densely thronged parterre opposite, I noted from my Roman version of a buttered muffin a tall, young Scandinavian girl, clad in complete corduroy, gray in color to the very cap surmounting her bandeaux of dark-red hair. She looked like some of those athletic-minded young women of Ibsen's plays, and the pile of books on the table beside her tea suggested a student character. When she had finished her tea she put these books back into a leather bag, which they filled to a rigid repletion, and, after a few laconic phrases with the tea-girl, she went out like going off the stage. Her powerful demeanor somehow implied severe studies; but the tea-girl - a massive, confident, confiding Roman - said, No, she was studying Italian, and all those books related to the language, for which she had a passion. She was a Swede; and here the student being exhausted as a topic, and my own nationality being ascertained, What steps, the tea-girl asked, should one take if one wished to go to New York in order to secure a place as cashier in a restaurant? My facts were not equal to the demand upon them, nor are they equal to anything like exact knowledge of the intellectual pursuits of the many studious foreign youth of all ages and sexes whom one meets in Rome. As I say, our acquaintance with Italian is far less useful, however ornamental, than it used to be. The Romans are so quick that they understand you when they speak no English, and take your meaning before you can formulate it in their own tongue. A classically languaged friend of mine, who was hard bested in bargaining for rooms, tried his potential landlord in Latin, and was promptly answered in Latin. It was a charming proof that in the home of the Church her mother-speech had never ceased to be spoken by some of her children, but I never heard of any Americans, except my friend, recurring to their college courses in order to meet the modern Latins in their ancient parlance. In spite of this instance, and that of the Swedish votary of Italian, I decided that the studies of most strangers were archaeological rather than philological, historical rather than literary, topographical rather than critical. I do not say that I had due confirmation of my theory from the talk of the fellow-sojourners whom one is always meeting at teas and lunches and dinners in Rome. Generally the talk did not get beyond an exchange of enthusiasms for the place, and of experiences of the morning, in the respective researches of the talkers. Such of us as were staying the winter, of course held aloof from the hurried passers-through, or looked with kindly tolerance on their struggles to get more out of Rome in a given moment than she perhaps yielded with perfect acquiescence. We fancied that she kept something back; she is very subtle, and has her reserves even with people who pass a whole winter within her gates. The fact is, there are a great many of her, though we knew her afar as one mighty personality. There is the antique Rome, the mediaeval Rome, the modern Rome; but that is only the beginning. There is the Rome of the State and the Rome of the Church, which divide between them the Rome of politics and the Rome of fashion; but here is a field so vast that Ave may not enter it without danger of being promptly lost in it. There is the Rome of the visiting nationalities, severally and collectively; there is especially the Anglo-American Rome, which if not so populous as the German, for instance, is more important to the Anglo-Saxons. It sees a great deal of itself socially, but not to the exclusion of the sympathetic Southern temperaments which seem to have a strange but not unnatural affinity with it. So far as we might guess, it was a little more Clerical than Liberal in its local politics; if you were very Liberal, it was well to be careful, for Conversion lurked under many exteriors which gave no outward sign of it; if the White of the monarchy and the Black of the papacy divide the best Roman families, of course foreigners are more intensely one or the other than the natives. But Anglo-Saxon life was easy for one not self-obliged to be of either opinion or party; and it was pleasant in most of its conditions. In Rome our internationalities seemed to have certain quarters largely to themselves. In spite of our abhorrence of the destruction and construction which have made modern Rome so wholesome and delightful, most of us had our habitations in the new quarters; but certain pleasanter of the older streets, like the Via Sistina, Via del Babuino, Via Capo le Case, Via Gregoriana, were our sojourn or our resort. Especially in the two first our language filled the outer air to the exclusion of other conversation, and within doors the shopmen spoke it at least as well as the English think the Americans speak it. It was pleasant to meet the honest English faces, to recognize the English fashions, to note the English walk; and if these were oftener present than their American counterparts, it was not from our habitual minority, but from our occasional sparsity through the panic that had frightened us into a homekeeping foreign to our natures. In like manner our hyphenated nationalities have the Piazza di Spagna for their own. There are the two English book-stores and the circulating libraries, in each of which the books are so torn and dirty that you think they cannot be quite so bad in the other till you try it; there seems nothing for it, then, but to wash and iron the different Tauchnitz authors, and afterward darn and mend them. The books on sale are, of course, not so bad; they are even quite clean; and except for giving out on the points of interest where you could most wish them to abound, there is nothing in them to complain of. There is less than nothing to complain of in the tea-room which enjoys our international favor except that at the most psychological moment of the afternoon you cannot get a table, in spite of the teas going on in the fashionable hotels and the friendly houses everywhere. The toast is exceptional; the muffins so far from home are at least reminiscent of their native island; the tea and butter are alike blameless. The company, to the eye of the friend of man, is still more acceptable, for, if the Americans have dwindled, the English have increased; and there is nothing more endearing than the sight of a roomful of English people at their afternoon tea in a strange land. No type seems to predominate; there are bohemians as obvious as clerics; there are old ladies and young, alike freshly fair; there are the white beards of age and the clean-shaven cheeks of youth among the men; some are fashionable and some outrageously not; peculiarities of all kinds abound without conflicting. Some talk, frankly audible, and others are frankly silent, but a deep, wide purr, tacit or explicit, close upon a muted hymn of thanksgiving, in that assemblage of mutually repellent personalities, for the nonce united, would best denote the universal content. Hard by this tea-room there is a public elevator by which the reader will no doubt rather ascend with me than, climb the Spanish Steps without me; after the first time, I never climbed them. The elevator costs but ten centimes, and I will pay for both; there is sometimes drama thrown in that is worth twice the money; for there is war, more or less roaring, set between the old man who works the elevator and the young man who sells the tickets to it. The law is that the elevator will hold only eight persons, but one memorable afternoon the ticket-seller insisted upon giving a ticket to a tall, young English girl who formed an unlawful ninth. The elevator-man, a precisian of the old school, expelled her; the ticket-seller came forward and reinstated her; again the elder stood upon the letter of the law; again the younger demanded its violation. The Tuscan tongue in their Roman mouths flew into unintelligibility, while the poor girl was put into the elevator and out of it; and the respective parties to the quarrel were enjoying it so much that it might never have ended if she had not taken the affair into her own hands. She finally followed the ticket-seller back to his desk, to which he retired after each act of the melodrama, and threw her ticket violently down. \\\"Here is your ticket!\\\" she said in English so severe that he could not help understanding and cowering before it. \\\"Give me back my money!\\\" He was too much stupefied by her decision of character to speak; and he returned her centimes in silence while we got into our cage and mounted to the top, and the elevator-man furiously repeated to himself his side of the recent argument all the way up. This did not prevent his touching his hat to each of us in parting, and assuring us that he revered us; a thing that only old-fashioned Romans seem to do nowadays, in the supposed decay of manners which the comfortable classes everywhere like to note in the uncomfortable. Then some ladies of our number went off on a platform across the house-tops to which the elevator had brought us, as if they expected to go down the chimneys to their apartments; and the rest of us expanded into the Piazza Trinita de' Monti; and I stopped to lounge against the uppermost balustrade of the Spanish Steps. It is notable, but not surprising, how soon one forms the habit of this, for, seen from above, the Spanish Steps are only less enchanting than the Spanish Steps seen from below, whence they are absolutely the most charming sight in the world. The reader, if he has nothing better than a post-card (which I could have bought him on the spot for fifty a franc), knows how the successive stairways part and flow downward to right and left, like the parted waters of a cascade, and lose themselves at the bottom in banks of flowers. No lovelier architectural effect was ever realized from a happy fancy; but, of course, the pictorial effect is richer from below, especially from the Via dei Condotti, where it opens into the Piazza di Spagna. I suppose there must be hours of the day, and certainly there are hours of the night, when in this prospect the Steps have not the sunset on them. But most of the time they have the sunset on them, warm, tender; a sunset that begins with the banks of daffodils and lilies and anemones and carnations and roses and almond blossoms, keeping the downpour of the marble cascades from flooding the piazza, and mounts, mellowing and yellowing, up their gray stone, until it reaches the Church of Trinita de' Monti at the top. \\nThere it lingers, I should say, till dawn, bathing the golden-brown facade in an effulgence that lifelong absence cannot eclipse when once it has blessed your sight. It is beauty that rather makes the heart ache, and the charm of the Steps from above is something that you can bear better if you are very, very worthy, or have the conceit of feeling yourself so. It is a charm that imparts itself more in detail and is less exclusively the effect of perpetual sunset. From the parapet against which you lean you have a perfecter conception of the architectural form than you get from below, and you are never tired of seeing the successive falls of the Steps dividing themselves and then coming together on the broad landings and again parting and coming together. If there were once many models, male, female, and infant, brigands, peasants, sages, and martyrs, lounging on the Spanish Steps, as it seems to me there used to be, and as every one has heard say, waiting there for the artists to come and carry them off to their studios and transfer them to their canvases, they are now no longer there in noticeable number. I saw some small boys in steeple-crowned soft hats and short jackets, with their little legs wound round with the favorite bandaging of brigands; and some mothers suitable for Madonnas, perhaps, with babes at the breast; there was a patriarchal old man or two, ready no doubt to pose for the prophets, or, at a pinch, for yet more celestial persons; but for the rest the Steps were rather given up to flower-girls, fruit-peddlers, and beggars pure and simple, on levels distinctly below those infested by the post-card peddlers. The whole neighborhood abounds in opportunities for charity, and at the corner of the Via Sistina there is a one-legged beggar who professes to black shoes in the intervals of alms-taking, and who early made me his prey. If sometimes I fancied escaping by him to my lounge against the parapet of the steps, he joyously overtook me with a swiftness of which few two-legged men are capable; he wore a soldier's cap, and I hoped, for the credit of our species, that he had lost his leg in battle, but I do not know. On a Sunday evening I once hung there a long time, watching with one eye the people who were coming back from their promenade on the Pincian Hill, and with the other the groups descending and ascending the Steps. On the first landing below me there was a boy who gratified me, I dare say unconsciously, by trying to stand on his hands; and a little dramatic spectacle added itself to this feat of the circus. Two pretty girls, smartly dressed in hats and gowns exactly alike, and doubtless sisters, if not twins, passed down to the same level. One was with a handsome young officer, and walked staidly beside him, as if content with her quality of captive or captor. The other was with a civilian, of whom she was apparently not sure. Suddenly she ran away from him to the verge of the next fall of steps, possibly to show him how charmingly she was dressed, possibly to tempt him by her grace in flight to follow her madly. But he followed sanely and slowly, and she waited for him to come up, in a capricious quiet, as if she had not done anything or meant anything. That was all; but I am not hard to suit; and it was richly enough for me. \\nHer little comedy came to its denouement just under the shoulder of the rose-roofed terrace jutting from a lowish, plainish house on the left, beyond certain palms and eucalyptus-trees. It is one of the most sacred shrines in Rome, for it was in this house that the \\\"young English poet whose name was writ in water\\\" died to deathless fame three or fourscore years ago. It is the Keats house, which when he lived in it was the house of Severn the painter, his host and friend. I had visited it for the kind sake of the one and the dear sake of the others when I first visited Rome in 1864; and it was one of the earliest stations of my second pilgrimage. It is now in form for any and all visitors, but the day I went it had not yet been put in its present simple and tasteful keeping. A somewhat shrill and scraping-voiced matron inquired my pleasure when she followed me into the ground-floor entrance from somewhere without, and then, understanding, called hor young daughter, who led me up to the room where Keats mused his last verse and breathed his last sigh. It is a very little room, looking down over the Spanish Steps, with their dike of bloom, across the piazza to the narrow stretch of the Via del Babuino. I must have stood in it with Severn and heard him talk of Keats and his ultimate days and hours; for I remember some such talk, but not the details of it. He was a very gentle old man and fondly proud of his goodness to the poor dying poet, as he well might be, and I was glad to be one of the many Americans who, he said, came to grieve with him for the dead poet. Now, on my later visit, it was a cold, rainy day, and it was chill within the house and without, and I imputed my weather to the time of Keats's sojourn, and thought of him sitting by his table there in that bare, narrow, stony room and coughing at the dismal outlook. Afterward I saw the whole place put in order and warmed by a generous stove, for people who came to see the Keats and Shelley collections of books and pictures; but still the sense of that day remains. The young girl sympathized with my sympathy, and wished to find a rose for me in the trellis through which the rain dripped. She could not, and I suggested that there would be roses in the spring. \\\"No,\\\" she persisted, \\\"sometimes it makes them in the winter,\\\" but I had to come away through the reeking streets without one. When it rains, it rains easily in Rome. But the weather was divine the evening I looked one of my latest looks down on the Spanish Steps. The sun had sunk rather wanly beyond the city, but a cheerful light of electrics shone up at me from the Via dei Condotti. I stood and thought of as much as I could summon from the past, and I was strongest, I do not know why, with the persecutions of the early Christians. Presently a smell of dinner came from the hotels around and the houses below, and I was reminded to go home to my own table d'hote. My one-legged beggar seemed to have gone to his, and I escaped him; but I was intercepted by the sight of an old woman asleep over her store of matches. She was not wakened by the fall of my ten-centime piece in her tray, but the boy drowsing beside her roused himself, and roused her to the dreamy expression of a gratitude quite out of scale with my alms. \\n\\nV. AN EFFORT TO BE HONEST WITH ANTIQUITY\\nMy visit to the Roman Forum when the Genius Loci verified to my ignorance and the intelligence of my companions the well-conjectured site of the Temple of Jupiter Stator was not the first nor yet the second visit I had paid the place. There had been intermediate mornings when I met two friends there, indefinitely more instructed, with whom I sauntered from point to point, preying upon their knowledge for my emotion concerning each. Information is an excellent thing - in others; and but for these friends I should not now be able to say that this mouldering heap of brickwork, rather than that, was Julius Caesar's house; or just where it was that Antony made his oration over the waxen effigy which served him for Caesar's body. They helped me realize how the business life and largely the social life of Rome centred in the Forum, but spared me so much detail that my fancy could play about among its vanished edifices without inconvenience from the clutter of shops and courts and monuments which were ultimately to hem it in and finally to stifle it. They knew their Forum so well that they could not only gratify any curiosity I had, but could supply me with curiosity when I had none. For the moment I was aware that this spot or that, though it looked so improbable, was the scene of deeds which will reverberate forever; they taught me to be tolerant of what I had too lightly supposed fables as serious traditions closely verging on facts. I learned to believe again that the wolf suckled Romulus and Remus, because she had her den no great way off on the Palatine, and that Romulus himself had really lived, since he had died and was buried in the Forum, where they showed me his tomb, or as much of it as I could imagine in the sullen little cellar so called. They also showed me the rostrum where the Roman orators addressed the mass-meetings of the republican times, and they showed me the lake, or the puddle left of it, into which Curtius (or one of three heroes of the name) leaped at an earlier day as a specific for the pestilence which the medical science of the period had failed to control. In our stroll about the place we were joined by one of the several cats living in the Forum, which offered us collectively its acquaintance, as if wishing to make us feel at home. It joined us and it quitted us from time to time, as the whim took it, but it did not abandon us wholly till we showed a disposition to believe in that lake of Curtius, so called after those three public-spirited heroes, the first being a foreigner. Then the cat, which had more than once stretched itself as if bored, turned from us in contempt and went and lay down in a sunny corner near the tomb of Romulus, and fell asleep. \\nIt is quite possible that my reader does not know, as lately I did not, that the Roman Forum is but one of several forums connected with it by ways long centuries since buried fathoms deep and built upon many stories high. But I am now able to assure him that in the whole region between the Roman Forum and the Forum of Trajan, which were formerly opened into each other by the removal of a hill as tall as the top of Trajan's Column, you pass over other forums hidden beneath your feet or wheels. You cannot be stayed there, however, by the wonders which archaeology will yet reveal in them (for archaeology has its relentless eye upon every inch of the ground above them), but you will certainly pause at the Forum of Trajan, where archaeology, as it is in Commendatore Boni, has had its way already. In fact, until his work in the Roman Forum is finished, the Forum of Trajan must remain his greatest achievement, and the sculptured column of the great emperor must serve equally as the archaeologist's monument. I do not remember why in the old time I should have kept coming to look at that column and study the sculptured history of Trajan's campaigns, toiling around it to its top. I think one could then get close to its base, as now one cannot, what with the deepening of the Forum to its antique level and the enclosure of the whole space with an iron rail. The area below is free only to a large company of those cats which seem to have their dwelling among all the ruins and restorations of ancient Rome. People come to feed the Trajan cats with the fish sold near by for the purpose, and one morning, in pausing to view his column from the respectful distance I had to keep, I counted no less than thirteen of his cats in his forum. They were of every age and color, but much more respectable in appearance than the cats of the Pantheon, which have no such sunny expanse as that forum for their quarters, but only a very damp corner beside the temple, and seem to have suffered in their looks and health from the situation. It was afterward with dismay that I realized the fatal number of the Trajan cats coming to their breakfast that morning so unconscious of evil omen in the figure; but as there are probably no statistics of mortality among the cats of Rome, I shall never know whether any of the thirteen has rendered up one of their hundred and seventeen lives. However, if I allowed myself to go on about the cats of Rome, either ancient or modern, there would be no end. For instance, in a statuary's shop in the Via Sistina there is a large yellow cat, which I one day saw dressing the hair of the statuary's boy. It performed this office with a very motherly anxiety, seated on the top of a high rotary table where ordinarily the statuary worked at his carving, and pausing from time to time, as it licked the boy's thick, black locks, to get the effect of its labors. On other days or at other hours it slept under the table-top, unvexed by the hammering that went on over its head. Even in Rome, where cats are so abundant, it was a notable cat. If you visit the Roman Forum in the morning you are only too apt to be hurried home by remembrance of the lunch-hour. That, at any rate, was my case, but I was not so hungry that I would not pause on my way hotelward at what used to be the Temple of Vesta in my earlier time, but which, is now superseded by the more authentic temple in the Forum. I had long revered the first in its former quality, and I now paid it the tribute of unwilling renunciation. It is so nearly a perfect relic of ancient Rome and so much more impressive, in its all but unbroken peristyle, than the later but recumbent claimant to its identity that I am sure the owners of the little bronze or alabaster copies of it scattered over the world must share my pious reluctance. The custodian is still very proud of it, and would have lectured me upon it much longer than I let him; as it was, he kept me while he could cast a blazing copy of the Popolo Romano into the cavernous crypt under it, apparently to show me how deep it was. He may have had other reasons; but in any case I urge the traveller to allow him to do it, for it costs no additional fee, and it seems to do him so much good. If it is not very near lunch-time, let the traveller look well about him in the dusty little piazza there, for the Temple of Fortune, with its bruised but beautiful facade, is hard by, as much in the form that Servius Tullius gave it as could well be expected after all this time. Perhaps the Circus of Marcellus is on the traveller's way home to lunch; but he will always be passing the segment of its arcaded wall, filled in with mediaeval masonry; and he need not stop, especially if he has his cab by the hour, for there is nothing more to be seen of the circus. A glimpse, through overhanging foliage, of the steps to the Campidoglio, with Castor and Pollux beside their horses at top, may be a fortunate accident of his course. If this happens it will help to rehabilitate for him the Rome of the paganism to which these divinities remained true through all temptations to Judaize during the unnumbered centuries of their sojourn, forgotten, in the Ghetto. It is hardly possible that his glimpse will include even the top of Marcus Aurelius's head where he sits his bronze charger - an extremely fat one - so majestically in the piazza beyond those brothers, as if conscious of being the most noble equestrian statue which has ridden down to us from antiquity. A more purposed sight of all this will, of course, supply any defects of chance, though I myself always liked chance encounters with the monuments of the past. I had constantly cherished a remembrance of the nobly beautiful facade which is all that is left of the Temple of Neptune, and I meant deliberately to revisit it if I could find out where it was. A kind fortuity befriended me when one day, driving through the little piazza where it lurks behind the Piazza Co-lonna, I looked up, and there, in awe-striking procession, stood the mighty antique columns sustaining the entablature of mediaeval stucco with their fluted marble. I could not say why their poor, defaced, immortal grandeur should have always so affected me, for I do not know that my veneration was due it more than many other fragments of the past; but no arch or pillar of them all seems so impressive, so pathetic. To make the reader the greatest possible confidence, I will own that I passed five times through the Piazza Colonna to my tailor's in the next piazza (at Rome your tailor wishes you to try on till you have almost worn your new clothes out in the ordeal) before I realized that the Column of Marcus Aurelius was not the more famous Column of Trajan. There is, in fact, a strong family likeness between these columns, both being bandaged round from bottom to top with the tale of the imperial achievements and having a general effect in common; but there is no brother or cousin to the dignity of that melancholy yet vigorous ruin of the Temple of Neptune, or anything that resembles it in the whole of ancient Rome. It survives having been a custom-house and being a stock-exchange without apparent ignominy, while one feels an incongruity, to say the least, in the Column of Marcus Aurelius looking down on the sign of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Whether this is worse than for the Palazzo di Venezia to confront the American Express Company where it is housed on the other side of the piazza I cannot say. What I can say is that I believe the Temple of Neptune would have been superior to either fate; though I may be mistaken. Ruin, nearly everywhere in Rome, has to be very patient of the environment; and even the monuments of the past which are in comparatively good repair have not always the keeping that the past would probably have chosen for them. One that suffers as little as any, if not the very least, is the Pantheon, on whose glorious porch you are apt to come suddenly, either from a narrow street beside it or across its piazza, beyond the fountain fringed with post-card boys and their bargains. In spite of them, the sight of the temple does mightily lift the heart; and though you may have had, as I had, forty-odd years to believe in it, you must waver in doubt of its reality whenever you see it. It seems too great to be true, standing there in its immortal sublimity, the temple of all the gods by pagan creation, and all the saints by Christian consecration, and challenging your veneration equally as classic or catholic. It is worthy the honor ascribed to it in the very latest edition of Murray's Handbook as \\\"the best-preserved monument of ancient Rome\\\"; worthy the praise of the fastidious and difficult Hare as \\\"the most perfect pagan building in the city\\\"; worthy whatever higher laud my unconsulted Baedeker bestows upon it. But I speak of the outside; and let not the traveller grieve if he comes upon it at the noon hour, as I did last, and finds its vast bronze doors closing against him until three o'clock; there are many sadder things in life than not seeing the interior of the Pantheon. The gods are all gone, and the saints are gone or going, for the State has taken the Pantheon from the Church and is making it a national mausoleum. Victor Emmanuel the Great and Umberto the Kind already lie there; but otherwise the wide Cyclopean eye of the opening in the roof of the rotunda looks down upon a vacancy which even your own name, as written in the visitors' book, in the keeping of a solemn beadle, does not suffice to fill, and which the lingering side altars scarcely relieve. I proved the fact by successive visits; but, after all my content with the outside of the Pantheon, I came to think that what you want in Rome is not the best-preserved monument, not the most perfect pagan building, but the most ruinous ruin you can get. I am not sure that you get this in the mouldering memorials of the past on the Palatine Hill, but you get something more nearly like it than anything I can think of at the moment. In that imperial and patrician and plutocratic residential quarter you see, if you are of the moderately moneyed middle class, what the pride of life must always come to when it has its way; and your consolation is full if you pause to reflect how some day Fifth Avenue and the two millionaire blocks eastward will be as the Palatine now is. Riches and power are of the same make in every time, though they may wear different faces from age to age; and it will be well for the very wealthy members of our smart set to keep this fact in mind when they visit that huge sepulchre of human vainglory. But I will not pretend that I did so myself that matchless April morning when I climbed over the ruins of the Palatine and found the sun rather sickeningly hot there. That is to say, it was so in the open spaces which were respectively called the house of this emperor and that, the temple of this deity or that, whose divine honors half the Caesars shared; in the Stadium, beside the Lupercal, and the like. The Lupercal was really imaginable as the home of the patroness wolf of Rome, being a wild knot of hill fitly overgrown with brambles and bushes, and looking very probably the spot where Caesar would thrice have refused the crown that Antony offered him. But for the rest, one ruin might very well pass for another; a temple with a broken statue and the stumps of a few columns could very easily deceive any one but an archaeologist. Fortunately we had the charming companionship of one of the most amiable of archaeologists, who was none the less learned for being a woman; and she made even me dimly aware of identities which would else have been lost upon me. To be sure, I think that without help I should have known the Stadium when I came to it, because it seemed studied from that in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and, though it was indefinitely more dilapidated, was so obviously meant for the same sorts of games and races. I do not know but it was larger than the Cambridge Stadium, though I will not speak so confidently of its size as of that deathly cold in the vaults and subterranean passages by which we found our way to the burning upper air out of the foundations and basements of palaces and temples and libraries and theatres that had ceased to be. \\nOne of the most comfortable of these galleries was that in which Caligula was justly done to death, or, if not Caligula, it was some other tyrant who deserved as little to live. But for our guide I should not have remembered his slaughter there, and how much satisfaction it had given me when I first read of it in Goldsmith's History of Rome; and really you must not acquaint yourself too early with such facts, for you forget them just when you could turn them to account. History is apt to forsake you in the scene of it and come lagging hack afterward; and you cannot hope always to have an archaeologist at your elbow to remind you of things you have forgotten or possibly have not known. Suetonius, Plutarch, De Quincey, Gibbon, these are no bad preparations for a visit to the Palatine, but it is better to have read them yesterday than the day before if you wish to draw suddenly upon them for associations with any specific spot. If I were to go again to the Palatine, I would take care to fortify myself with such structural facts from Hare's Walks in Rome, or from Murray, or even from Baedeker, as that it was the home of Augustus and Tiberius, Domitian and Nero and Caligula and Septimius Severus and Germanicus, and a very few of their next friends, and that it radically differed from the Forum in being exclusively private and personal to the residents, while that was inclusively public and common to the whole world. I strongly urge the reader to fortify himself on this point, for otherwise he will miss such significance as the place may possibly have for him. Let him not trust to his impressions from his general reading; there is nothing so treacherous; he may have general reading enough to sink a ship, but unless he has a cargo taken newly on board he will find himself tossing without ballast on those billowy slopes of the Palatine, where he will vainly try for definite anchorage. The billowy effect of the Palatine, inconvenient to the explorer, is its greatest charm from afar, in whatever morning or evening light, or sun or rain, you get its soft, brownish, greenish, velvety masses. Distance on it is best, and distance in time as well as space. If you can believe the stucco reconstruction opposite the Forum gate, ruin has been even kinder to the Palatine than to the Forum, with which it was equally ugly when in repair, if taken in the altogether, however beautiful in detail. As you see it in that reproduction, it is a horror, and a very vulgar horror, such a horror as only unlimited wealth and uncontrolled power can produce. If you will think of individualism gone mad, and each successive personality crushing out and oversloughing some other, without that regard for proportion and propriety which only the sense of a superior collective right can inspire, you will imagine the Palatine. Mount Morris, at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, if unscrupulously built upon by the multimillionaires thronging to New York and seeking to house themselves each more splendidly and spaciously than the other, would offer a suggestion in miniature of what the Palatine seems to have been like in its glory. But the ruined Mount Morris, even allowing for the natural growth of the landscape in two thousand years, could show no such prospect twenty centuries hence as we got that morning from a bit of wilding garden near the Convent of San Bonaventura, on the brow of the Palatine. Some snowy tops pillowed themselves on the utmost horizon, and across the Campagna the broken aqueducts stalked and fell down and stumbled to their legs again. The Baths of Caracalla bulked up in rugged, monstrous fragments, and then in the foreground, filling the whole eye, the Colosseum rose and stood, and all Rome sank round it. The Forum lay deep under us, vainly struggling with the broken syllables of its demolition to impart a sense of its past, and at our feet in that bit of garden where the roses were blooming and the plum-trees were blowing and the birds were singing, there stretched itself in the grass a fallen pillar wreathed with the folds of a marble serpent, the emblem of the oldest worship under the sun, as I was proud to remember without present help. It was the same immemorial, universal faith which the Mound Builders of our own West symbolized in the huge earthen serpents they shaped uncounted ages before the red savages came to wonder at them, and doubtless it had been welcomed by Rome in her large, loose, cynical toleration, together with cults which, like that of Isis and Osiris, were fads of yesterday beside it. Somehow it gave the humanest touch in the complex impression of the overhistoried scene. It made one feel very old, yet very young - old with the age and young with the youth of the world - and very much at home. \\n\\nVI. PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH THE PAST \\nI was myself part of the antiquity with which I have been trying to be honest; and, though my date was no earlier than the seventh decade of the nineteenth century, still so many and such cataclysmal changes had passed over Rome since my time that I was, as far as concerned my own consciousness, practically of the period of the Pantheon, say. The Pantheon, in fact, was among my first associations with Rome. I lodged very near it, in the next piazza, so that, if we were not contemporaries, we were companions, and I could not go out of my hotel to look up a more permanent sojourn without passing by it. Perhaps I wished to pass by it, and might really have found my way to the Corso without the Pantheon's help. I have no longer a definite idea why I should have made my sojourn in the very simple and modest little street called Via del Gambero, which runs along behind the Corso apparently till it gets tired and then stops. But very possibly it was because the Via del Gambero was so simple and modest that I chose it as the measure of my means; or possibly I may have heard of the apartment I took in it from wayfarers passing through Venice, where I then lived, and able to commend it from their own experience of it; people in that kind day used to do such things. However it was, I took the apartment, and found it, though small, apt for me, as Ariosto said of his house, and I dwelt in it with my family a month or more in great comfort and content. In fact, it seemed to us the pleasantest apartment in Rome, where the apartments of passing strangers were not so proud under Pius IX. as they are under Victor Emmanuel III. I do not know why it should have been called the Street of the Lobster, but it may have been in an obscure play of the fancy with the notion of a backward gait in it that I came to believe that, in the many improvements which had befallen Rome, Via del Gambero had disappeared. Destroyed, some traveller from antique lands had told me, I dare say; obliterated, wiped out by the march of municipal progress. At any rate, I had so long resigned the hope of revisiting the quiet scene that when I revisited Rome last winter, after the flight of ages, and one day found myself in a shop on the Corso, it was from something like a hardy irony that I asked the shopman if a street called Via del Gambero still existed in that neighborhood. I said that I had once lodged in it forty-odd years before; but I believed it had been demolished. Not at all, the shopman said; it was just behind his place; and what was the number of the house? I told him, and he laughed for joy in being able to do me a pleasure; me, a stranger from the strange land of sky-scratchers (grattacieli), as the Italians not inadequately translate sky-scrapers. If I would favor him through his back shop he would show me how close I was upon it; and from his threshold he pointed to the corner twenty yards off, which, when I had turned it, left me almost at my own door. In that transmuted Rome Via del Gambero, at least, was wholly unchanged, and there was not a wrinkle in the front of the house where we had sojourned so comfortably, so contentedly, in our incredible youth. I had not quite the courage to ring and ask if we were at home; but, standing across the way and looking up at the window, it seemed to me that I might have seen my own young face peering out in a somewhat suspicious question of the old eyes staring up so fixedly at it. Who was I, and what was I doing there? Was I waiting, hanging idly about, to see the Armenian archbishop coming to carry my other self in his red coach to the Sistine Chapel, where we were to hear Pius IX. say mass? There was no harm in my hanging about, but the street was narrow and there was a chance of my being ground up by some passing cart against the wall there behind me if I was not careful. I could not tell my proud young double that we were one, and that I was going in the archbishop's red coach as well; he would never have believed it of my gray hairs and sunken figure. I could not even ask him what had become of the grocer near by, whom I used to get some homely supplies of, perhaps eggs or oranges, or the like, when I came out in the December mornings, and who, when I said that it was very cold, would own that it was un poco rigidetto, or a little bit stiffish. The ice on the pavement, not clean-swept as now, but slopped and frozen, had been witness of that; the ice was gone and the grocer with it; and where really was I? At the window up there, or leaning against the apse of the church opposite? What church was it, anyway? I never knew; I never asked. Why should I insist upon a common identity with a man of twenty-seven to whom my threescore and ten could only bring perplexity, to say the least, and very likely vexation? I went away from Via del Gambero, where the piety of the reader will seek either of myselves in vain. In my earlier date one used to see the red legs of the French soldiers about the Roman streets, and the fierce faces of the French officers, fierce as if they felt themselves wrongfully there and were braving it out against their consciences. Very likely they had no conscience about it; they had come there over the dead body of the Roman Republic at the will of their rascal president, and they were staying there by the will of their rascal emperor, to keep on his throne the pope from whom the Italians had hoped for unity and liberty. No one is very much to blame for anything, I suppose, and very likely Pius IX. had not voluntarily disappointed his countrymen, who may have expected too much. But then the French had been there fifteen years, and were to be there another fifteen years yet. Now they are gone, with the archbishop's red coach, and the complaisant grocer, and the young man of twenty-seven in Via del Gambero, and the rest of the things that the sun looked on and will look on the like of again, no doubt, in our monotonous round of him. To-day, instead of the red legs of the French soldiers, you see the blue legs of the Italian soldiers, and instead of the fierce faces of their officers, the serious, intelligent, mostly spectacled faces of the Italian officers, in sweeping cloaks of tender blue verging on lavender. They are soldierly men none the less for their gentler aspect, and perhaps something the more; and a better thing yet is that there are comparatively few of them. There are few of the privates also, far fewer than the priests and the students of the ecclesiastical schools, who dress like priests and go dashing through the streets in files and troops. I have an impression that one sees about the proportion of Italian soldiers in Rome that one sees of American soldiers in Washington, or, at least, not many more. The barracks are apparently outside the walls; there you meet cavalry going and coming, and detachments of bersaglieri; or riflemen, pushing on at their quick trot, or plainer infantry trudging wearily. Certainly, in a capital where the Church holds itself prisoner, there is no show of force on the part of its captors; and this is pleasant to the friend of man and the lover of Italy for other reasons. In the absence of the military you can imagine that not only does the state not wish to boast its political supremacy in the ancient capital of the Church, but it does not desire to show the potentiality of holding its own against the republic which is instinct there. The monarchy is the consensus of all the differing wills in Italy, which naturally would not for the most part have chosen a monarchy. But never was a monarchy so mild-mannered or seated so firmly, for the present at least, in the affection and reason of its people. This is not the place (as writers say who have not prepared themselves with the requisite ideas at a given point) to speak of the situation in Rome; and I meant only to note that there are more ecclesiastics than conscripts to be seen there. Of all the varying costumes of the varying schools, none is so pleasing, so vivid, as that of the German students as they rush swiftly by in their flying robes of scarlet. The red matches the ruddy health in their cheeks, and there is a sort of gladness in their fling that wins the liking as well as the looking; so that almost one would not mind being a German student of theology one's self. There are other-costumes running in color from violet, and blue with orange sashes, to unrelieved black and black trimmed with red; but I cannot remember which nationality wears which. \\nI am not sure but one sees as many priests in Rome now as in the times when they ruled it; and I am no such Protestant that I will pretend I do not like a monsignore when I meet him, either in the street or at afternoon tea, as one sometimes may. I have no grudge against priests of any rank; but I did not seek to see them at the functions, as I used in the old days to do. Shall I say that I now rather tolerated than welcomed myself there through the hospitality which so freely opens the churches of the Church to all comers of whatever creed? What right had I, a heretic and recusant, to come staring and standing round where the faithful were kneeling and praying? If we could conceive of our fast-locked conventicles being thrown as freely open, could we conceive of Catholics wandering up and down their naves and aisles while the hymning or preaching went on? After being so high-minded in the matter, shall I confess that I was a good deal kept out of the churches by the cold in them? It was a sort of stored cold, much greater than that outside, though there was something warming to the fancy, at least, in the smoke and smell of the incense. Even with the Church of the Capuchins, which we lived opposite, I was dilatory, though in my mediaeval days it had been one of the first places to which I hurried. In those days everybody said you must be sure and go to the Capuchins', because Guide's \\\"St. Michael and the Enemy\\\" was there, and still more because the wonderful bone mosaics in the cemetery under the church were not on any account to be missed. I suspect that in both these matters I had then a very crude taste, but it was not from my greater refinement that I now let the Capuchin church go on long un-revisited. It was, for one thing, too instantly and constantly accessible across the street there; and it is well known human nature is such that it will not seek the line of the least resistance as long as it can help. Besides, I could hardly believe that it was really the Capuchin church which I had once so hastened to see, and I neglected it almost two months, contenting myself with the display of those hand-bills on the convent walls, spreading largely and glaringly incongruous over it. When I did go I found the Guido ridiculous, of course, in the painter's imagination of the archangel as a sort of dancing figure in a tableau vivant, and yet of a sublime authority in the execution. To be more honest, I had little feeling about it and less knowledge. It was not so cold in the church as I had expected; and in the succession of side chapels, beginning with the St. Michael's and opening into one another, we found a kind of domesticity close upon cosiness, which we were enjoying for its own sake, when we were aware of a pale, gentle young girl who seemed to be alone there. She asked, in our unmistakable native accents, if we were going to see the Capuchin mosaics in their place below; and one of us said, promptly, No, indeed; but relented at the shadow of disappointment that came over the girl's face, and asked, Was she going? The girl said, Oh, she guessed she could see them some other time; and then she who had spoken ordered him who had not spoken to go with her. I do not know what question of propriety engaged them with reference to her going alone with the handsome young monk waiting to accompany her; but he was certainly too handsome for a monk of any age. We followed him, however, and I had my usual nausea on viewing the decoration of the ceilings and walls of the place below; it always makes me sick to go into that place; between realizing that I am of the same make as the brothers composing those mosaics, and trying to imagine what the intricate patterns will do at the Resurrection Day, I cannot command myself. Neither am I supported by the sight of some skeletons, the raw material of that grewsome artistry, deposited whole in their coffins in the niches next the ground, though their skulls smile so reassuringly from their cowls; their cheeriness cannot make me like them. But my companion seemed to be merely interested; and I fancied her deciding that it all quite came up to her expectations, while I translated for her from the monk that the dead used to be left in the hallowed earth from Jerusalem covering the ground before they were taken up and decoratively employed, but that since the Italian occupation of Rome the art had fallen into abeyance. She said nothing, but when we came out she stood a moment on the pavement beside our cab and confessed herself a New England girl, from an inland town, who was travelling with relatives. She had been sick, and she had come alone, as soon as she could get out, to see the wonders of the Capuchin church, because she had heard so much of them. We said we hoped she had been pleased, and she said, \\\"Oh yes, indeed,\\\" and then she said, \\\"Well, good-bye,\\\" and gently tilted away, leaving us glad that there could still be in an old, spoiled world such sweetness and innocence and easily gratified love of the beautiful. Taking Rome so easily, so provisionally, while waiting the eventualities of the colds which mild climates are sure to give their frequenters from the winterlands, I became aware of a latent anxiety respecting St. Peter's. I did not feel that the church would really get away without our meeting, but I felt that it was somehow culpably hazardous in me to be taking chances with it. As a family, we might never collectively visit it, and, in fact, we never did; but one day I drove boldly (if secretly) off alone and renewed my acquaintance with this contemporary of mine; for, if you have been in Rome a generation and a half ago, you find that you are coeval not only with the regal, the republican, and the imperial Rome, but with each Rome of the successive popes, down, at least, to that of Pius IX. St. Peter's will not be, by any means, your oldest friend, but it will be an acquaintance of such long standing that you may not wish to use it with all the frankness which its faults invite. If you say, when you drive into its piazza between the sublime colonnades which stretch forth their mighty embrace as if to take the whole world to the church's heart, that here is the best of St. Peter's, you will not be wrong. If you say that here is grandeur, and that there where the temple fronts you grandiosity begins, you will be rhetorical, but, again, you will not be wrong. The day of my furtive visit was sober and already waning, with a breeze in which the fountains streamed flaglike, and with a gentle sky on which the population of statues above the colonnades defined themselves in leisure attitudes, so recognizable all that I am sure if they had come down and taken me by the hand we could have called one another by name without a moment's hesitation. Every detail of a prospect which is without its peer on earth, but may very possibly be matched in Paradise, had been so deeply stamped in my remembrance that I smiled for pleasure in finding myself in an environment far more familiar than any other I could think of at the time. It was measurably the same within the church, but it was not quite the same in the reserves I was obliged to make, the reefs I was obliged to take in my rapture. The fact is, that unless you delight in a hugeness whose bareness no ornamentation can, or does at least, conceal, you do not find the interior of St. Peter's adequate to the exterior. In the mere article of hugeness, even, it fails through the interposition of the baldachin midway of the vast nave, and each detail seems to fail of the office of beauty more lamentably than another. I had known, I had never forgotten, that St. Peter's was very, very baroque, but I had not known, I had not remembered how baroque it was. It is not so badly baroque as the Church of the Jesuits either in Rome or in Venice, or as the Cathedral at Wuerzburg; but still it is badly baroque, though, again, not so baroque in the architecture as in the sculpture. In the statues of most of the saints and popes it could not be more baroque; they swagger in their niches or over their tombs in an excess of decadent taste for which the most bigoted agnostic, however Protestant he may be, must generously grieve. It is not conceivably the taste of the church or the faith; it is the taste of the wicked world, now withered and wasted to powerlessness, which overruled both for evil in art from its evil life. The saints and the popes are, aesthetically, lamentable enough; but the allegories in bronze or marble, which are mostly the sixteenth-century notions of the Virtues, are inexpressible - some of these creatures ought really to be put out of the place; but I suppose their friends would say they ought to be left as typical of the period. In the case of that merciless miscreant, Queen Christina of Sweden, who has her monument in St. Peter's, there would be people to say she must have her monument in some place; but, all the same, remembering Monaldeschi - how he was stabbed to death by her command, the kinder assassins staying their hands from time to time, while his confessor went vainly to implore her pardon - it is shocking to find her tomb in the prime church in Christendom. At first it offends one to see certain pontiffs with mustaches and imperials and goatees; but, if one reflects that so they wore them in life, one perceives right in it; only when one comes to earlier or later popes, bearded in medieval majority or shaven in the decent modern fashion, one can endure those others only as part of the prevailing baroque of the church. Canova was not so Greek or even so classic as one used to think him, but one hardly has a moment of repose in St. Peter's till one comes to a monument by him and rests in its quiet. It is tame, it is even weak, if you like; but compared with the frantic agglomeration of gilt clouds and sunbursts, and marble and bronze figures in the high-altar, it is heavenly serene and lovely. There were not many people in St. Peter's that afternoon, so that I could give undisturbed attention to the workman repairing the pavement at one point and grinding the marble smooth with a slow, secular movement, as if he were part of its age-Ions: waste and repair. Another day, the last day I came, there were companies of the personally conducted, following their leaders about and listening to the lectures in several languages, which no more stirred the immense tranquillity than they themselves qualified the spacious vacancy of the temple: you were vaguely sensible of the one and of the other like things heard and seen in a drowse. It was a pleasant vagueness in which all angularities of feeling were lost, and you were disposed to a tolerance of the things that had hurt or offended you before. As a contemporary of the edifice, throughout its growth, you could account for them more and more as of their periods. Perhaps through your genial reconciliation there came, however dimly, a suggestion of something unnatural and alien in your presence there as a mere sightseer, or, at best, a connoisseur much or little instructed. If you had been there, say, as a worshipper, would you have been afflicted by the incongruities of the sculptures or by the whole baroque keeping? Possibly this consideration made you go away much modester than you came. \\\"After all,\\\" you may have said, \\\"it is not a gallery; it is not a museum. It is a house of prayer,\\\" and you emerged, let us hope, humbled, and in so far fitted for renewed joy in the beauty, the glory of the sublime colonnades. \\n\\nVII. CHANCES IN CHURCHES \\nIf any one were to ask me which was the most beautiful church in Rome I should temporize, and perhaps I should end by saying that there was none. Ecclesiastical Rome seems to have inherited the instinct of imperial Rome for ugliness; only, where imperial Rome used the instinct collectively, ecclesiastical Rome has used it distributively in the innumerable churches, each less lovely than the other. This position will do to hedge from; it is a bold outpost from which I may be driven in, especially by travellers who have seen the churches I did not see. I took my chances, they theirs; for nobody can singly see all the churches in Rome; that would need a syndicate. If imperial Rome was beautiful in detail because it had the Greeks to imagine the things it so hideously grouped, ecclesiastical Rome may be unbeautiful in detail because it had not the Goths to realize the beauty of its religious aspiration - that is, if it was the Goths who invented Gothic architecture; I do not suppose it was. Anyway, there is said to be but one Gothic church in Rome, and this I did not visit, perhaps because I felt that I must inure myself to the prevalent baroque, or perhaps from mere perversity. I can merely say in self-defence that, on the outside, Santa Maria sopra Minerva no more promised an inner beauty than Il Gesu, which is the most baroque church in Rome, without the power of coming together for a unity of effect which baroque churches sometimes have. It is a tumult of virtuosity in painting, in sculpture, in architecture. Statues sprawl into frescoed figures at points in the roof, and frescoed figures emerge in marble at others. Marvels of riches are lavished upon chapels and altars, which again are so burdened with bronze gilded or silver plated, and precious stones wrought and unwrought, that the soul, or if not the soul the taste, shrinks dismayed from them. Execution in default of inspiration has had its way to the last excess; there is nothing that it has not done to show what it can do; and all that it has done is a triumph of misguided skill and power. But it would be a mistake for the spectator to imagine that anything has been done from the spirit in which he receives it; everything is the expression of devoted faith in the forms that the art of the time offered. In the monstrous marble tableau, say, of \\\"Religion Triumphing Over Heresy,\\\" he may be very sure that the artist was not winking an ironical eye where he made Faith spurning Schism with her foot look very much like a lady of imperfect breeding who has lost her temper; he was most devoutly in earnest, or at least those were so, both cleric and laic, for whom he wrought his prodigy. We others, pagans or Protestants, had better understand that the children of the Church, and especially the poor children, were serious through all the shows that seem to us preposterous; they had not renounced something for nothing; if they bowed that very fallible thing, Reason, to Dogma, they got faith for their reward and could gladly accept whatever symbol of it was offered them. \\nNo matter how baroque any church was, it could express something of this sincerity, and in their way the worshippers seemed always simply at home in it. In San Lorenzo in Lucina, where I went to see the truly sublime \\\"Crucifixion\\\" by Guido (there is also a bar of St. Lawrence's gridiron to be seen, but I did not know it at the time) I liked the unconsciousness of the girl kneeling before the high altar and provisionally gossiping with the young sacristan before she began her devotions. She gave her mind to them when he asked me if I wished to see the Guido, for I could see her lips moving while she shared my veneration of that most affecting masterpiece; the more genuinely affecting because it expresses the rapture and not the anguish of the Passion. I have no doubt she was grateful when the sacristan proposed my having the electric light turned on it, and when, though that I knew it would cost me something more, I assented. They have the electric light now in all the holy places, and notably in the dungeon where St. Peter was imprisoned, and where the custodian was so proud of it, as the latest improvement, and as far more satisfactory than candles. The shrine of the miraculous Bambino in the Church of Ara Coeli is also lighted by electricity, which spares no detail of the child's apparel and appearance. To other eyes than those of faith it has the effect of a life-size but not life-like doll, piously bedizened and jewelled over, but rather ill-humored looking, or, if not that, proud looking or severe looking. To the eyes in which its sickbed visits have dried the tears it must wear an aspect of heavenly pity and beauty; and I am very willing to believe that these are the eyes which see it aright. As it was, and taking it literally, it seemed far less mechanical and unfeeling than the monk who pulled it out and pushed it back on its wheeled platform. But he must get tired of showing it to the unbelievers who come out of curiosity, and very likely I should, if I were in his place, as nonchalantly wipe across the glass front of the shrine the card with the Bambino's legend printed in various languages on it, which you may then buy with the blessing from the glass for whatever you choose to give. Where art and antiquity are so abundant as in Rome, the Bambino incident is probably what the reader, when he has visited the Church of Ara Coeli will chiefly remember, and I will not pretend to be any better than the reader, though I will say that I have a persistent sense of something important about the roof; and there are the Pinturrichio frescos, which an old Sienese like me must have the taste for. The not easily praiseful Hare says it is \\\"one of the most interesting of Christian churches,\\\" and without allowing that there are any other sorts of churches I may allow that this is one of the least unlovely in Rome. Trinita de' Monti seemed to be another, but only, I dare say, subjectively, because of the exquisite pleasure we had one afternoon in March when we went into it for the nuns' singing of the Benediction. That, we had been told, was something which no one coming to Rome should miss; and we were so anxious not to miss it that on our way to the Pincian Hill we stopped at the foot of the church-steps, and reassured ourselves of the hour through the kindness of an English-speaking nurse-maid at the bottom and of a gentle nun at the top, who both told us the hour would be exactly five. When we came back at that time and bought our way into the church by rightful payment to the two blind beggars who guarded its doors, we found it packed with people who bad been more literally punctual. They were of all nations, but a large part were Anglo-Americans, and a young girl of this race rose and gave her seat, with a sweet insistence that would not be denied, to that one of us who deserved it most. He who was left leaning against the soft side of a pillar hesitated whether to make some young priests spreading over undue space on one of the benches push up, and he enjoyed a rich moment of self-satisfaction in his forbearance. He was there, to be sure, an alien and a heretic, out of mere curiosity, and they were there probably so rapt in their devout attention that they did not notice their errant step-brother, and so did not think to offer him the hospitality of their mother church's house. But he would not make any such allowance; he condemned them with the unsparing severity of the strap-hanger in a trolley-car, who blushes with shame for the serried rows of men sitting behind their newspapers. When he was at his wit's end to find excuse for them a priest on another bench made room, and he sank down glad to forgive and forget; but now he would not have yielded his place to any other Protestant in Christendom. In the collective curiosity he lost the sense of self-reproach for his own, and eagerly bent his gaze on the group of officiating priests at the high altar beyond the grille of the choir. The altar was all a blaze of electric lights, and there was a novel effect in their composition in the crosses resting diagonally on either side of it. Next the grille showed the feathers and fashions of the mothers and sisters of the young girls from the school of the adjoining Convent of the Sacred Heart, and midway between these visitors, like a flock of white birds stooping on some heavenly plain, the white veils of the girls stretched in lovely levels to left and right. Nothing could have attuned the spirit for the surprise awaiting it like this angelic sight; and when the voices of the nuns fell suddenly from the organ gallery, behind all the people, like the singing of the morning stars molten in one adoring music and falling from the zenith down, whatever moments of innocent joy life might have had it could have had none surpassing that. But when we came out the self-mockery with which life is apt to recover itself from any exaltation began. In returning from the Pincio the only cab we had been able to get was the last left of the very worst cabs in Rome, and we had bidden the driver wait for us at the church-steps, not without some hope that he would play us false. But there he was, true to his word, with such disciplined fidelity as that of the Roman sentinels who used to die at their posts; and we mounted to ours with the muted prayer that we, at least, might reach home alive. This did not seem probable when the driver whipped up his horse. It appeared to have aged and sickened while we were in the church, though we had thought it looked as bad as could be before, and it lurched alarmingly from side to side, recovering itself with a plunge of its heavy head away from the side in which its body was sinking. The driver swayed on his box, having fallen equally decrepit in spite of the restoratives he seemed to have applied for his years and infirmities. His clothes had put on some such effect of extreme decay as those of Rip Van Winkle in the third act; there was danger that he would fall on top of his falling horse, and that their raiment would mingle in one scandalous ruin. Via Sistina had never been so full of people before; never before had it been so long to that point where we were to turn out of it into the friendly obscurity of the little cross street which would bring us to our hotel. We could not consent to arrive in that form; we made the driver stop, and we got out and began overpaying him to release us. But the more generously we overpaid him the more nobly he insisted upon serving us to our door. At last, by such a lavish expenditure as ought richly to provide for the few remaining years of himself and his horse, we prevailed with him to let us go, and reached our hotel glad, almost proud, to arrive on foot. \\nHare tells me, now it is too late, that I may reach the Church of Santa Maggiore by keeping straight on through the long, long straightness of the Via Sistina. I reached that church by quite another way after many postponements; for I thought I remembered all about it from my visit in 1864. But really nothing had remained to me save a sense of the exceptional dignity of the church, and the sole fact that the roof of its most noble nave is thickly plated with the first gold mined in South America, which Ferdinand and Isabella gave that least estimable of the popes, Alexander VI. Now I know that it is far richer than any gold could make it in the treasures of history and legend, which fairly encrust it in every part. Doubtless some portion of this wealth my fellow-sightseers were striving to store up out of the guide-books which they bore in their hands and from which they strained their eyes to the memorable points as they slowly paced through the temple. Some were reading one to another in bated voices, and I thought them ridiculous; but perhaps they were wise, and rather he was ridiculous who marched by them and contented himself with a general sense of the grandeur, the splendor. More than any other church except that of San Paolo fuori le Mura, Santa Maria Maggiore imparts this sense, for, as I have already pretended, St. Peter's fails of it. Without as well as within the church is spacious and impressive from its spaciousness; but it seems more densely fringed than most others with peddlers of post-cards and mosaic pins. On going in you can plunge through their ranks, but in coming out you do not so easily escape. One boy pursued me quite to my cab, in spite of my denials of hand and tongue. There he stayed the driver while he made a last, a humorous appeal. \\\"Skiddoo?\\\" he asked in my native speech. \\\"Yes,\\\" I sullenly replied, \\\"skiddoo!\\\" But it is now one of the regrets which I shall always feel for my wasted opportunities in Rome that I did not buy all his post-cards. Patient gayety like his merited as much. As it was, I drove callously away from Santa Maria Maggiore to San Pietro in Vincoli, where I expected to renew my veneration for Michelangelo's Moses. That famous figure is no longer so much in the minds of men as it used to be, I think; and, if one were to be quite honest with one's self as to the why and wherefore of one's earlier veneration, one might not get a very distinct or convincing reply. Do sculptors and painters suffer periods of slight as authors do? Are Raphael and Michelangelo only provisionally eclipsed by Botticelli and by Donatello and Mino da Fiesole, or are they remanded to a lasting limbo? I find I have said in my notes that the Moses is improbable and unimpressive, and I pretended a more genuine joy in the heads of the two Pollajuolo brothers which startle you from their tomb as you enter the church. Is the true, then, better than the ideal, or is it only my grovelling spirit which prefers it? What I scarcely venture to say is that those two men evidently lived and still live, and that Michelangelo's prophet never lived; I scarcely venture, because I remember with tenderness how certain clear and sweet spirits used to bow their reason before the Moses as before a dogma of art which must be implicitly accepted. Do they still do so, those clear and sweet spirits? \\nThe archaeologist who was driving my cab that morning had pointed out to me on the way to this church the tower on which Nero stood fiddling while Rome was burning. It is a strong, square, mediaeval structure which will serve the purpose of legend yet many centuries, if progress does not pull it down; but the fiddle no longer exists, apparently, and Nero himself is dead. When I came out and mounted into my cab, my driver showed me with his whip, beyond a garden wall, a second tower, very beautiful against the blue sky, above the slim cypresses, which he said was the scene of the wicked revels of Lucrezia Borgia. I do not know why it has been chosen for this distinction above other towers; but it was a great satisfaction to have it identified. Very possibly I had seen both of these memorable towers in my former Roman sojourn, but I did not remember them, whereas I renewed my old impressions of San Paolo fuori le Mura in almost every detail. That is the most majestic church in Rome, I think, and I suppose it is, for a cold splendor, unequalled anywhere. Somehow, from its form and from the great propriety of its decoration, it far surpasses St. Peter's. The antic touch of the baroque is scarcely present in it, for, being newly rebuilt after the fire which destroyed the fourth-century basilica in 1823, its faults are not those of sixteenth-century excess. It would be a very bold or a very young connoisseur who should venture to appraise its merits beyond this negative valuation; and timid age can affirm no more than that it came away with its sensibilities unwounded. Tradition and history combine with the stately architecture, which reverently includes every possible relic of the original fabric, to render the immense temple venerable; and as it is still in process of construction, with a colonnaded porch in scale and keeping with the body of the basilica, it offers to the eye of wonder the actual spectacle of that unstinted outlay of riches which has filled Rome with its multitudes of pious monuments - monuments mainly ugly, but potent with the imagination even in their ugliness through the piety of their origin. Where did all that riches come from? Out of what unfathomable opulence, out of what pitiable penury, out of what fear, out of what love? One fancies the dying hands of wealth that released their gift to the sacred use, the knotted hands of work that spared it from their need. The giving continues in this latest Christian age as in the earliest, and Rome is increasingly Rome in a world which its thinkers think no longer believes. From San Paolo we were going to another shrine, more hallowed to our literary sense, and we drove through the sweet morning sunshine and bird-singing, past pale-pink clouds of almond bloom on the garden slopes, with snowy heights far beyond, to the simple graveyard where Keats and Shelley lie. Our way to the Protestant cemetery held by some shabby apartment-houses of that very modern Rome which was largely so jerry-built, and which I would not leave out of the landscape if I could, for I think their shabbiness rather heightens your sense of the peaceful loveliness to which you come under the cypresses, among the damp aisles, so thickly studded with the stones recording the death in exile of the English strangers lying there far from home. In a faulty perspective of memory, I had always seen the graves of the two poets side by side; but the heart of Shelley rests in a prouder part of the cemetery, where the paths between the finer tombs are carefully kept; and the dust of Keats lies in an old, plain, almost neglected corner, well off beyond a dividing trench. It seems an ungracious chance which has so parted the two poets so inextricably united in their fame; it is as if here, too, the world would have its way; but, of course, it is only at the worst an ungracious chance. Keats, at least, has the companionship of the painter Severn, the friend on whose \\\"fond breast his parting soul relied,\\\" and who has here followed him into the dust. A few withered daisies had been scattered in the thin grass over the poet, and one hardly dared lift one's eyes from them to the heartbreaking epitaph which one could not spell for tears. \\n\\nVIII. A FEW VILLAS \\nIt was but a few minutes' walk from the hotel to the Porta Pinciana, and, if you took this short walk, you found yourself almost before you knew it in the Villa Borghese. You might then, on your first Sunday in Rome, have fancied yourself in Central Park, for all difference in the easily satisfied Sunday-afternoon crowd. But with me a difference began in the grove of stone-pines, and their desultory stretch toward the Casino, where in the simple young times which are now the old we had hurried, with our Kugler in our hands and other reading in our heads, to see Titian's Sacred and Profane Love (it has got another name now) and Canova's Pauline Bonaparte, who was also the Princess Borghese, and all the rest of the precious gallery. However, if I had any purpose of visiting the Casino now, I put it aside, and contented myself with the gentle sun, the gentle shade, and the sweet air, which might have had less dust in it, breathing over grass as green in late January as in early June. I did not care so much for a mounted corporal who was jumping his horse over a two-foot barrier in the circular path rounding between the Villa Borghese and the Pincian Hill, though his admirers hung in rows on the rail beside it so thickly that I could hardly have got a place to see him if I had tried. But there was room enough to the fathers and mothers who had brought their children, and young lovers who had brought each other for the afternoon's outing, just as the people in Central Park do, and, no doubt, just as any Sunday crowd must do in the planet Mars, if the inhabitants are human. There was a vacherie nearby where not many persons were drinking milk or even coffee; it is never the notion of the Italians that amusement can be had only through the purchase of refreshments. \\nI did not get as far as the Casino till the last Sunday of our Roman stay, though we came again and again to the park (as we should call it, rather than villa), sometimes to walk, sometimes to drive, and always to rejoice in its loveliness. It was not now a very guarded, if once a very studied, loveliness; not quite neglect, but a forgottenness to which it took kindly, had fallen upon it; the drives seemed largely left to take care of themselves, the walks were such as the frequenters chose to make over the grass or through the woods; the buildings - the aviary, the conservatory, the dairy, the stables - which formed part of the old pleasance, stood about, as if in an absent-minded indifference to their various roles. The weather had grown a little more wintry, or, at least, autumnal, as the season advanced toward spring, and one day at the end of February, when we were passing a woody hollow, the fallen leaves stirred crisply with a sound like that of late October at home. We had been at some pains and expense to put home four thousand miles away, but this sound was the sweetest and dearest we had heard in Rome, and it strangely attuned our spirits to the enjoyment of the fake antiquities, the broken arches, pediments, columns, statues, which, in a region glutted with ruin, the landscape architect of the Villa Borghese had fancied putting about in pleasing stages of artificial dilapidation. But there was nothing faked in the dishevelled grass of the little stadium, with its gradines around the sides, and the game of tennis which some young girls were playing in it. Neither was there anything ungenuine in the rapture of the boy whom we saw racing through the dead leaves of that woody hollow in chase of the wild fancies that fly before boyhood; and I hope that the charm of the plinths and statues in the careless grounds behind the soft, old, yellow Casino was a real charm. At any rate, these things all consoled, and the turf under the pines, now thickly starred with daisies, gave every assurance of being original. When we came last the daisies were mingled with clustering anemones, which seem a greatly overrated sort of flower, crude and harsh in color, like cheap calico. If it were not for their pretty name I do not see how people could like them; yet the children that day were pouncing upon them and pulling them by handfuls; for the Villa Borghese is now state property and is free to the children of the people in a measure quite beyond Central Park. They can apparently pull anything they want, except mushrooms; there are signs advising people that the state draws the line at mushrooms. It was once more a Sunday, and it was a free day in the Casino. The trodden earth sent up its homely, kindly smell from many feet on their way to the galleries, which we found full of people looking greater intelligence than the frequenters of such places commonly betray. They might have been such more cultivated sight-seers as could not afford to come on the paydays, and, if they had not crowded the room so, one might have been glad as well as proud to be of their number. They did not really keep one from older friends, from the statues and the pictures which were as familiarly there in 1908 as in 1864. In a world of vicissitudes such things do not change; the Sacred and Profane Love of Titian, though it had changed its name, had not changed its nature, and was as divinely serene, as richly beautiful as before. The Veroneses still glowed from the walls, dimming with their Venetian effulgence all the other pictures but the Botticellis and the Francias, and comforting one with the hope that, if one had always felt their beauty so much, one might, without suspecting it, have always had some little sense of art. But it was probably only a literary sense of art, such as moves the observer when he finds himself again in the presence of Canova's Pauline Borghese. That is there, on the terms which were those no less of her character than of her time, in the lasting enjoyment of a publicity which her husband denied it in his lifetime; but it had no more to say now than it had so many, many years ago. As, a piece of personal history it is amusing enough, and as a sermon in stone it preaches whatever moral you choose to read into it. But as the masterpiece of the sculptor it testifies to an ideal of his art for which the world has reason to be grateful. Criticism does not now put Canova on the height where we once looked up to him; but criticism is a fickle thing, especially in its final judgments; and one cannot remember the behavior of the Virtues in some of the baroque churches without paying homage to the portrait of a lady who, whatever she was, was not a Virtue, but who yet helped the sculptor to realize in her statue a Venus of exceptional propriety. Tame, yes, we may now safely declare Canova to have been, but sane we must allow; and we must never forget that he has been the inspiration in modern sculpture of the eternal Greek truth of repose from which the art had so wildly wandered, He, more than any other, stayed it in the mad career on which Michelangelo, however remotely, had started it; and we owe it to him that the best marbles now no longer strut or swagger or bully. It was by one of those accidents which are the best fortunes of travel that I visited the Villa Papa Giulio, when I thought I was merely going to the Piazza del Popolo, to which one cannot go too often. A chance look at my guide-book beguiled me with the notion that the villa was just outside the gate; but it was a deceit which I should be glad to have practised on me every February 17th of my life. If the villa was farther off than I thought, the way to it lay for a while through a tramwayed suburban street delightfully encumbered with wide-horned oxen drawing heavy wagon-loads of grain, donkeys pulling carts laden with vegetables, and children and hens and dogs playing their several parts in a perspective through which one would like to continue indefinitely. But after awhile a dim, cool, curving lane leaves this street and irresistibly invites your cab to follow it; and sooner than you could ask you get to the villa gate. There a gatekeeper tacitly wonders at your arriving before he is well awake, and will keep you a good five minutes while he parleys with another custodian before he can bring himself to sell you a ticket and let you into the beautiful, old, orange-gray cloistered court, where there is a young architect with the T-square of his calling sketching some point of it, and a gardener gently hacking off from the parent stems such palm-leaves as have survived their usefulness. Beyond is the famous fountained court, and a classic temple to the right, and other structures responsive to the impulses of the good Pope Julius III., who was never tired of adding to this pleasure palace of his. It was his favorite resort, with all his court, from the Vatican, and his favorite amusement in it was the somewhat academic diversion of proverbs, which Ranke says sometimes \\\"mingled blushes with the smiles of his guests.\\\" Lest the reader should think I have gone direct to Ranke for this knowledge, I will own that I got it at second-hand out of Hare's Walks in Rome, where he tells us also that the pope used to come to his villa every day by water, and that \\\"the richly decorated barge, filled with venerable ecclesiastics, gliding through the osier-fringed banks of the Tiber,... would make a fine subject for a picture.\\\" No doubt, and if I owned such a picture I would lose no time in public-spiritedly bestowing it on the first needy gallery. Our author is, as usual, terribly severe on the Italian government for some wrong done the villa, I could not well make out what. But it seems to involve the present disposition of the Etruscan antiquities in the upper rooms of the casino, where these, the most precious witnesses of that rather inarticulate civilization, must in any arrangement exhaust the most instructed interest. Just when the amateur archaeologist, however, is sinking under his learning, the custodian opens a window and lets him look out on a beautiful hill beyond certain gardens, where a bird is singing angelically. I suppose it is the same bird which sings all through these papers, and I am sorry I do not know its name. But we will call it a blackcap: blackcap has a sweet, saucy sound like its own note, and is the pretty translation of caponero, a name which the bird might gladly know itself by. \\nVilla Papa Giulio is but a little place compared with something on the scale of the Villa Pamfili Doria though from its casino it has a charm far beyond that. What it may once have been as to grounds and gardens there is little to show now, and the Pamfili Doria itself had not much to show in gardens, though it had grounds, and to spare. It is, in fact, a large park, though whether larger than the Villa Borghese I cannot say. But it has not been taken by the state, and it is so far off on its hills that it is safe from the overrunning of city feet. It is safe even from city wheels, unless they are those of livery carriages, for numbered cabs are not suffered in its proud precincts. You partake of this pride when you come in your rubber-tired remise, and have the consolation of being part of the beautiful exclusiveness. It costs you fifteen francs, but one must suffer for being patrician, even for a single afternoon. Outside we had the satisfaction of seeing innumerable numbered cabs drawn up, and within the villa gates of meeting or passing the plebeians who had come in them, and were now walking while we were smoothly rolling in our victoria. The day was everything we could ask, very warm and bright below the Janiculum, on which we had mounted, and here on the summit delicious with cool currents of air. There had been beggars, on the way up, at every point where our horses must be walked, and we had paid our way handsomely, so that when we went back they bowed without asking again; this is a convention at Rome which no self-respecting beggar will violate; they all touch their hats in recognition of it. The beautiful prospect from a certain curve of the drive after you have passed the formal sunken garden, at which you pause, is the greatest beauty of the Villa Pamfili Doria. You stop to look at it by the impulse of your coachman, and then you keep on driving round, in the long ellipse which the road describes, through grassy and woody slopes and levels, watered by a pleasant stream, and through long aisles of pine and ilex. We thought twice round was enough, and told the driver so, to his evident surprise and to our own regret, so far as the long aisle of ilex was concerned, for I do not suppose there is a more perfect thing of its kind in the world. The shade under the thick sun-proof roofing of horizontal boughs was practically as old as night, and on our second passage of its dim length it had some Capuchin monks walking down it, who formed the fittest possible human interest in the perspective. Off on the grass at one side some Ursuline nuns were sitting with their pupils, laughing and talking, and one nun was playing ball with the smaller girls, and mingling with their shouts her own gay, innocent cries of joy as she romped among them. Nothing could have been prettier, sweeter, or better suited to the place; all was very simple, and apparently the whole place was hospitably free to the poor women who ranged over it, digging chiccory for salad out of the meadows. The daisies were thick as white clover, and the harsh purple of the anemones showed everywhere. The casino is plainer than the casino of the Villa Borghese, and is not public like that; its sculptures have been taken to the Doria palace in the city; and there is no longer any excuse for curiosity even to try penetrating it. It stands on the left of the road by which you leave the villa, and to the right on the grassy incline in full view of the casino was something that puzzled us at first. It did not seem probable that the gigantic capital letters grown in box should be spelling the English name Mary, but it proved that they were, and later it proved that this was the name of the noble English lady whom the late Prince Pamfili Doria had married. Whether they marked her grave or merely commemorated her, it was easy to impute a pathos to the fancy of having them there, which it might not have been so easy to verify. You cannot attempt to pass over any ground in Rome without danger of sinking into historical depths from which it will be hard to extricate yourself, and it is best to heed one's steps and keep them to the day's activities. But one could not well visit the Villa Pamfili Doria without at least wishing to remember that in 1849 Garibaldi held it for weeks against the whole French army, in his defence of republican Rome. A votive temple within the villa grounds commemorates the invaders who fell in this struggle; on a neighboring height the Italian leader triumphs in the monument his adoring country has raised to him. If we are to believe the censorious Hare, the love of the hero's countrymen went rather far when the Roman municipality, to please him, tried to change the course of the Tiber in conformity with a scheme of his, and so spoiled the beauty of the Farnesina garden without effecting a too-difficult piece of engineering. The less passionate Murray says merely that \\\"a large slice of this garden was cut off to widen the river for the Tiber embankment,\\\" and let us hope that it was no worse. I suppose we must have seen the villa in its glory when we went, in 1864, to see the Raphael frescos in the casino there, but in the touching melancholy of the wasted and neglected grounds we easily accepted the present as an image of the past. For all we remembered, the weed-grown, green-mossed gravel-paths of the sort of bewildered garden that remained, with its quenched fountain, its vases of dead or dying plants, and its dishevelled shrubbery, were what had always been; and it was of such a charm that we were gratefully content with it. The truth is, one cannot do much with beauty in perfect repair; the splendor that belongs to somebody else, unless it belongs also to everybody else, wounds one's vulgar pride and inspires envious doubts of the owner's rightful possession. But when the blight of ruin has fallen upon it, when dilapidation and disintegration have begun their work of atonement and exculpation, then our hearts melt in compassion of the waning magnificence and in a soft pity for the expropriated possessor, to whom we attribute every fine and endearing quality. It is this which makes us such friends of the past and such critics of the present, and enables us to enjoy the adversity of others without a pang of the jealousy which their prosperity excites. There was much to please a somewhat peculiar taste in our visit to the Farnesina. The gateman, being an Italian official, had not been at the gate when we arrived, but came running and smiling from his gossip with the door-keeper of the casino, and this was a good deal in itself; but the door-keeper, amiably obese, was better still in her acceptance of the joke with which the hand-mirror for the easier study of the roof frescos was accepted. \\\"It is more convenient,\\\" she suggested, and at the counter-suggestion, \\\"Yes, especially for people with short necks,\\\" she shook with gelatinous laughter, and burst into the generous cry, \\\"Oh, how delightful!\\\" Perhaps this was because she, too, had experienced the advantage of perusing the frescos in the hand-mirror's reversal. At any rate, she would not be satisfied till she had returned a Roland for that easy Oliver. Her chance came in showing a Rubens in one of the rooms, with the master's usual assortment of billowy beauties, when she could say - and she ought to have known - that they had eaten too much macaroni. It was not much of a joke; but one hears so few jokes in Rome. Do I linger in this study of simple character because I feel myself unequal to the ecstasies which the frescos of Raphael and his school in that pleasure dome demanded of me? Something like that, I suppose, but I do not pride myself on my inability. It seemed to me that the coloring of the frescos had lost whatever tenderness it once had; and that what was never meant to be matter of conscious perception, but only of the vague sense which it is the office of decoration to impart, had grown less pleasing with the passage of time. There in the first hall was the story of Cupid and Psyche in the literal illustration of Apuleius, and there in another hall was Galatea on her shell with her Nymphs and Tritons and Amorini; and there were Perseus and Medusa and Icarus and Phaeton and the rest of them. But, if I gave way to all the frankness of my nature, I should own the subjects fallen silly through the old age of an outworn life and redeemed only by the wonderful skill with which they are rendered. At the same time, I will say in self-defence that, if I had a very long summer in which to keep coming and dwelling long hours in the company of these frescos, I think I might live back into the spirit which invented the fables, and enjoy even more the amusing taste that was never tired of their repetition. Masterly conception and incomparable execution are there in histories which are the dreams of worlds almost as extinct as the dead planets whose last rays still reach us and in whose death-glimmer we can fancy, if we will, a unity of life with our own not impossible nor improbable. But more than some such appeal the Raphaels and the Giulio Romanos of the Farnesina hardly make to the eye untrained in the art which created them, or unversed in the technique by which they will live till the last line moulders and the last tint fades. We came out and stood a long time looking up in the pale afternoon light at the beautiful face of the tenderly aging but not yet decrepit casino. It was utterly charming, and it prompted many vagaries which I might easily have mistaken for ideas. This is perhaps the best of such experiences, and, after you have been with famous works of art and have got them well over and done with, it is natural and it is not unjust that you should wish to make them some return, if not in kind, then in quantity. You will try to believe that you have thought about them, and you should not too strictly inquire as to the fact. It is some such forbearance that accounts for a good deal of the appreciation and even the criticism of works of art. \\n\\nIX. DRAMATIC INCIDENTS \\nIf the joke of the door-keeper at the Farnesina was not so delicate in any sense as some other jokes, it had, at least, the merit of being voluntary. In fact, it is the only voluntary joke which I remember hearing in the Tuscan tongue from the Roman mouth during a stay of three months in the Eternal City. This was very disappointing, for I had always thought of the Italians as gay and as liking to laugh and to make laugh. In Venice, where I used to live, the gondoliers were full of jokes, good, bad, and indifferent, and an infection of humor seemed to spread from them to all the lower classes, who were as ready to joke as the lower classes of Irish, and who otherwise often reminded one of them. The joking habit extended as far down as Florence, even as Siena, and at Naples I had found cabmen who tempered their predacity with bonhomie. But the Romans were preferably serious, at least with the average American, though, if I had tried them in their English instead of my Italian, it might have been different. At times I thought, they felt the weight of being Romans, as it had descended to them from antiquity, and that the strain of supporting it had sobered them. In any case, though there was shouting by night, and some singing of not at all the Neapolitan quality and still less the Neapolitan quantity, there was no laughing, or, as far as I could see, smiling by day. Yet one day there was a tragedy in front of the hotel next ours which would have made a dog laugh, as the saying is, unless it was a Roman dog. It was a quarrel, more or less murderous, between a fat, elderly man and an agile stripling of not half his age or girth, of whom the tumult about them permitted only fleeting glimpses. By these the elder seemed to be laboriously laying about him with a five-foot club and the younger to be making wild dashes at him and then escaping to the skirts of the cabmen, mounted and dismounted, who surrounded them. Now and then a cabman drove out of the mellee very excitedly, and then turned and drove excitedly back into the thick of it. All the while the dismounted cabmen pressed about the combatants with their hands on one another's backs and their heads peering carefully over one another's shoulders. On the very outermost rim of these, more careful than any, was one of those strange images whom you see about Italian towns in couples, with red-braided swallowtail coats and cocked hats, those carabinieres - namely, who are soldiers in war and policemen in times of peace. Any spectator from a foreign land would have thought it the business of such an officer of the law to press in and stop the fighting; but he did not so interpret his duty. He gingerly touched the shoulders next him with the tips of his fingers, and now and then lifted himself on the tips of his toes to look if the fight had stopped of itself or not. At last the fat, elderly man, whom his friends - and all the throng except that one wicked youth seemed his friends - were caressing in untimely embraces and coaxing in tones of tender entreaty, burst from them, and, aiming at the head of his enemy, flung his club, to the imminent peril of all the bystanders, and missed him. Then he frankly put himself in the hands of his friends, who lifted him into a cab, where one of them mounted with him and stayed him on the seat, while the cabman drove rapidly away. The wicked youth had vanished in unknown space; but the carabiniere, attended by a group of admirers, marched boldly up the middle of the street, and the crowd, with whatever reluctance, persuaded itself to disperse, though the cabmen, to the number of ten or twenty, continued to drive around in concentric circles and irregular ellipses. In five minutes not an eye-witness of the fray remained, such being the fear of the law, not so much in those who break it as in those who see it broken, and who dread incurring the vengeance of the culprit, if he is acquitted, or of his family if he is convicted on their testimony. The quarrel had gone on a full quarter of an hour, but the concierge of the hotel in front of which it had raged professed to have known nothing of it, having, he said, been in-doors all the time. A cabman whom we eliminated from the hysterical company of his fellows and persuaded to drive us away to see a church attempted to ignore the whole affair when asked about it. With difficulty he could be made to recollect it, and then he dismissed it as a trifle. \\\"Oh,\\\" he said, \\\"chiacchiere di donnicciuole,\\\" which is something like \\\"Clatter of little old women,\\\" a thing not worth noticing. He had, if we could believe him, not cared to know how it began or ended, and he would not talk about it. Later, still interested by the action of the carabiniere in guarding the public security in his own person, I asked an Italian gentleman, who owned to have seen the affair, why the officer did not break through the crowd and arrest the fighters. \\\"They had knives,\\\" he explained, and it seemed a good reason for the carabiniere's forbearance, as far as it went; but I thought of the short work the brute locust of an Irish policeman at home would have made of the knives. My friend said he had himself gone to one of the municipal police who was looking on at a pleasant remove and said, \\\"Those fellows have knives; they will kill each other,\\\" and the municipal policeman had answered, with the calm of an antique Roman sentinel on duty in time of earthquake, \\\"Let them kill.\\\" I could not approve of so much impartiality, but afterward it seemed to me I had little to be proud of in the shorter and easier method of our own police, as contrasted with the caution of that Roman carabiniere who left the combatants to the mild might of their friends' moral suasion. It was better that the youth should escape, if he did, without a vexatious criminal trial; he may have been no more to blame than the other, who, I learned, had been carried off, in the honorable manner I saw, to a doctor and had his stab looked to. It was not dangerous, and the whole affair ended so. Besides, as I learned, still longer afterward, when it was quite safe for a cabman from the same stand to speak, the combatants were not Romans, but peasants from the Campagna, who had come in with their market-carts and had become heated with the bad spirits which the peasants have the habit of drinking five or six glasses of when they visit Rome. \\\"What we call benzine,\\\" my cabman explained. \\\"We Romans,\\\" he added from a moral height, \\\"drink only a glass or two of wine, and we never carry knives.\\\" He may have been right concerning the peacefulness of the Romans and their sobriety, and I am bound to say that I never saw any other violent scene during my stay. Sometimes I heard loud quarrelling among our cabmen, and sometimes I was the subject of it, when one driver snatched me, an impartial prey, from another. But the bad feeling, if there was really any, quickly passed, and some other day I fell to the cabman who had been wronged of me. I had not always the fine sense of being booty which I had one day on coming out of a church and blundering toward the wrong cab. Then the driver whom I had left waiting at the door seized me from the very cab of an unjust rival with the indignant cry, \\\"E roba mia!\\\" (He's my stuff!). It was not quite the phrase I would have chosen, but I had no quarrel, generally speaking, with the cabmen of Rome. To be sure, they have not a rubber tire among them, and their dress leaves much to be desired in professional uniformity. Not one of them looks like a cabman, but many of them in picturesqueness of hats and coats look like brigands. I think they would each prefer to have a fur-lined overcoat, which the Roman of any class likes to wear well into the spring; but they mostly content themselves with an Astrakhan collar, more or less mangy. For the rest, some of them will point out the objects of interest as you pass, and they are proud to do so; they are not extortionate, and, if you overpay them ever so little (which is quite worth while), they will not stand upon a matter of lawful fare. A two-cent tip contents them, one of four cents makes them your friends for life; as for a five-cent tip, I do not know what it does, but I advise the reader when he goes to Rome to try it and see. One fine thing is that the cabmen are in great superabundance in Rome, and the number of barrel-ribbed, ewe-necked, and broken-kneed horses is in no greater proportion than in Paris. Still, the average is large, though, if you will go to the stand, you may select any horse you please without offence. It was a cheerful sight, verging upon gayety, to see every morning the crowd of cabs at our stand and to hear the drivers' talk, sometimes rising into protest and mutual upbraiding. But one Thursday morning, the brightest of the spring, a Sunday silence had fallen on the place, and a Sabbath solitude deepened to the eye the mystery that had first addressed itself to the ear. Then, suddenly, we knew that we were in the presence of that Italian conception of a general strike which interprets itself as a sciopero. It is saying very little of that two days' strike to say that it was far the most impressive experience of our Roman winter; in some sort it was the most impressive experience of my life, for I beheld in it a reduced and imperfect image of what labor could do if it universally chose to do nothing. The dream of William Morris was that a world which we know is pretty much wrong could be put right by this simple process. The trouble has always been to get all sorts of labor to join in the universal strike, but in the Italian sciopero of four years ago the miracle was wrought from one end of the peninsula to the other. In the Roman strike of last April a partial miracle of the same nature was illustratively wrought, with the same alarming effect on the imagination. As with the national strike, the inspiration of the Roman strike came from the government's violent dealing with a popular manifestation which only threatened to be mischievous. A stone-mason was killed by falling from a scaffolding, and his funeral was attended by so many hundreds, amounting to thousands, of workmen that the police conceived, not quite unjustifiably, that it was to be made the occasion of a demonstration, especially as the proposed route of the procession lay through the Piazza di Venezia, under the windows of the Austrian Embassy, Austria being always a red rag to the Italian bull and peculiarly irritating through the reservation of the Palazzo Venezia to the ancient enemy at the cession of Venice to Italy. The mourners were therefore forbidden to pass that way, and the police forces were drawn up in the Piazza Gesu, before the Jesuit church, with a strong detachment of troops to support them. Their wisdom in all this was very questionable after what followed, for the mourners insisted on their rights and would go no way but through the Piazza di Venezia. When the dispute was at its height two wagons laden with bricks appeared on the scene. The mourners swarmed upon them, broke the bricks into bats, and hurled them at the police. They had apparently the simple-hearted expectation that the police would stand this indefinitely, but the brickbats hurt, and in their paroxysms of pain the sufferers began firing their revolvers at the mourners. Four persons were killed, with the usual proportion of innocent spectators. At night the labor unions met, and the sciopero was proclaimed as an expression of the popular indignation; but the police had been left with the victory. Whether it was not in some sort a defeat I do not know, but a retired English officer, whom I had no reason to think a radical, said to me that he thought it a great mistake to have let the police oppose the people with firearms. Soldiers should alone be used for such work; they alone knew when to fire and when to stop, and they never acted without orders. In fact, the troops supporting the police took no part in the fray, as the workmen's press recognized with patriotic rejoicing. The next morning a signal silence prevailed throughout the city, where not a wheel stirred or the sound of a hoof broke the hush of the streets. We had noted already that there were seven Sundays every week in Rome, as was fit in the capital of the Christian religion, but this Thursday was of an intenser Sabbath stillness than any first day of the week that we had yet known. There was the clack of passing feet in the street under our windows, but we looked out upon a yawning void where the busy cabs had clustered, and the cabmen had socially chaffed and quarrelled, and entreated the stranger in the cabman's superstition that a stranger never knows when he wants a cab. Now he could have walked all over Rome without being once invited to drive. Except for here and there a private carriage, or the coupe evidently of a doctor, the streets were empty, and the tourists had to join the citizens in their pedestrian exercise. The shopkeepers had been notified to close their places of business on the tacit condition of having their windows broken for non-compliance, but in the early forenoon they were still slowly and partially putting up their shutters. You could get in through the darkened doors up till noon; after that it was more and more difficult. But it would be hard to say how far and how deep the sciopero went. In our hotel we knew of it only the second day through the failure of the morning rolls, for there had been no baking overnight. Most of the in-door service was of Swiss or other foreign extraction, and the mechanism of our comfort, our luxury, was operated as usual. Our floor facchino, or porter, went to the meeting of the unions in the evening, being an Italian. Otherwise the strike fell especially on the helpless and guiltless foreigner, who might be, and very often was, in sympathy with the strikers. He had to walk to the ruins, the galleries, the gardens, the churches, if he wanted anything of them; he could not get a carriage even from a stable. Between the hotels and the station the omnibus traffic was suspended. The railroads being national, push-carts manned by the government employes carried the baggage to and fro, but if one wanted to arrive or depart one had to do it on foot. Tragical scenes presented themselves in relation to this fact. In the afternoon, as I walked up the street toward the great railroad station, I saw coming down the middle of it a strange procession of ladies and gentlemen of every age, gray-haired elders and children of tender years, mixed with porters and push-carts, footing it into the region of the fashionable hotels. They were all laden according to their strength, and people who had never done a stroke of work in their lives were actually carrying their own hand-bags, rugs, and umbrella-cases. It was terrible. It was terrible for what it was, and terrible for what it suggested, if ever that poor dull beast of labor took the bit permanently into its teeth, or, worse yet, hung back in the breeching and inexorably balked. What would then become of us others, us ladies and gentlemen who had never done a stroke of work and never wished to do one? Should we be forced to the hard necessity of beginning? Could we remain in the comfortable belief that we gave work, or must we be made to own distastefully that it had always been given to us? Should we be able to flatter ourselves with the notion that we had once had dependents because we had money, or should we realize that we had always been dependents because of our having money? These were the hateful doubts which the Roman strike suggested to the witness, or, at least, one of the witnesses, who has here the pleasure of unburdening himself upon the reader. Yet there was something amusing in the situation; there was a joke - that rarest of all things in Rome - latent in it, which one suspected only from the amiable, the all-but-smiling behavior of the strikers. There was not the slightest disorder during the two days that the strike lasted. When it was called off at a meeting of the unions on Saturday night, one of the seven Sundays of the Roman week dawned upon an activity at the neighboring cab-stand no peacefuller and not much gayer than the silence and solitude of the mornings previous. As for the general effect in the city, you would hardly have known that particular Sunday from those which had gone by the names of Friday and Saturday. Throughout Italy there is now a Sunday-closing law whose effect in a land once of joyous Sabbaths strikes some such chill to the heart as pierces it in Boston on that day, or in the farther eastern or western avenues of New York, when the Family Entrances are religiously locked. The Italian state has, in fact, so far taken the matter in charge as to have established a secular holiday, coming once a week, which has almost disestablished the holidays of the Church, formerly of much more frequent occurrence. This secular holiday, which every workman has a right to, he may neither give nor sell to his master. He may not even loaf it away in the place where he works, lest he should be clandestinely employed. He must go out of the shop or house or factory or foundry, and spend his ten hours where he cannot be suspected of employing them in productive industry for hire. This law has been enacted in accordance with the will of the unions and no doubt in correction of great abuses. Neither masters nor men now recognize the old-fashioned festa as they once did. Whether the men like the new holiday so well, I did not get any of them explicitly to say. Of course, they cannot all take it at once; they must take it turn about, and they may not find their enforced leisure so lively as the old voluntary saints' days, when their comrades were resting, too. As for the masters, one of the employers of labor, whom I found filling his man's place, would merely say: \\\"It is the new law. No doubt we shall adjust ourselves to it.\\\" He did not complain. \\n\\nX. SEEING ROME AS ROMANS SEE US \\nShortly after our settlement in the Eternal City, which has so much more time to be seen than the so-journer has to see it, I pleased myself with the notion of surprising it by visiting in a studied succession the many different piazzas. This, I thought, would acquaint me with the different churches, and on the way to them I should make friends with the various quarters. Everything, old or new, would have the charm of the unexpected; no lurking ruin would escape me; no monument, whether column or obelisk, statue, \\\"storied urn or animated bust\\\" or mere tablet, would be safe from my indirect research. Before I knew it, I should know Rome by heart, and this would be something to boast of long after I had forgotten it. I could not say what suggested so admirable a notion, but it may have been coming by chance one day on the statue of Giordano Bruno, and realizing that it stood in the Campo di Fieri, on the spot where he was burned three hundred years ago for abetting Copernicus in his sacrilegious system of astronomy, and for divers other heresies, as well as the violation of his monastic vows. I saw it with the thrill which the solemn figure, heavily draped, deeply hooded, must impart as mere mystery, and I made haste to come again in the knowledge of what it was that had moved me so. Naturally I was not moved in the same measure a second time. It was not that the environment was, to my mind, unworthy the martyr, though I found the market at the foot of the statue given over, not to flowers, as the name of the place might imply, but to such homely fruits of the earth as potatoes, carrots, cabbages, and, above all, onions. There was a placidity in the simple scene that pleased me: I liked the quiet gossiping of the old market-women over their baskets of vegetables; the confidential fashion in which a gentle crone came to my elbow and begged of me in undertone, as if she meant the matter to go no further, was even mattering. But the solemnity of the face that looked down on the scene was spoiled by the ribbon drawn across it to fasten a wreath on the head, in the effort of some mistaken zealot of free thought to enhance its majesty by decoration. It was the moment when the society calling itself by Giordano Bruno's name was making an effort for the suppression of ecclesiastical instruction in the public schools; and on the anniversary of his martyrdom his effigy had suffered this unmeant hurt. In all the churches there had been printed appeals to parents against the agnostic attack on the altar and the home, and there had been some of the open tumults which seem in Rome to express every social emotion. But the clericals had triumphed, and an observer more anxious than I to give a mystical meaning to accident might have interpreted the disfiguring ribbon over Bruno's bronze lips as a new silencing of the heretic. \\nI certainly did not construe it so, and, if my notion of serially visiting the piazzas of Rome was not prompted by my chance glimpse of the Campo di Fiori, it was certainly not relinquished because of any mischance in my meditated vision of it. I had merely reflected that I could not hope to carry out my scheme without greater expense both in time and money than I could well afford, for, though cabs in Rome are swift and cheap, yet the piazzas are many and widely distributed; and I finally decided to indulge myself in a novelty of adventure verging close upon originality. It had always seemed to me that the happy strangers mounted on the tiers of seats that rise from front to back on the motor-chariots for seeing New York and looking down, even from the lowest place, on the life of our streets had a peculiar, almost a bird's-eye view of it which I might well find the means of a fresh impression. But I never had the courage, for reasons which I have not the courage to give, though the reader can perhaps imagine them. In Rome I did not feel that the like reasons held; of all the unknown, I was one of the most unknown; by me nobody would be put to the shame of recognizing an acquaintance on the benches of the like chariot, or forced to the cruelty of cutting him in my person. When once I had fully realized this, it was only a question of the time when I should yield to the temptation which renewed itself as often as I saw the stately automobile passing through the storied streets, with its English legend of \\\"Touring Rome\\\" inscribed on the back of the rear seat. There remained the question whether I should go alone or whether I should ask the countenance of friends in so bold an enterprise. When I suggested it to some persons of the more courageous sex, they did not wait to be asked to go with me; they instantly entreated to be allowed to go; they said they had always wished to see Rome in that way; and we only waited to be chosen by the raw and blustery afternoon which made us its own for the occasion. It was the eve of the last sad day of such shrunken and faded carnival as is still left to Rome, and there were signs of it in the straggling groups of children in holiday costume, and in here and there a pair of young girls in a cab, safely masked against identification and venting, in the sense of wild escape, the joyous spirits kept in restraint all the rest of the year. Already in the Corso, where our touring-car waited for us at the first corner, a great cafe was turning itself inside out with a spread of chairs and tables over the sidewalk, which we found thronged on our return with spectators far outnumbering the merrymakers of the carnival. Our car was not nearly so packed, and when we mounted to the benches we found that the last and highest of them was left to the sole occupancy of a young man, well enough dressed (his yellow gloves may have been more than well enough) and well-mannered enough, who continued enigmatical to the last. There was a German couple and there were some French-speaking people; the rest of us were bound in the tie of our common English. The agent of the enterprise accompanied us, an international of undetermined race, and beside the chauffeur sat the middle-aged, anxious-looking Italian who presently arose when we made our first stop in the Piazza Colonna and harangued us in three languages - successively, of course - concerning the Column of Marcus Aurelius. He did not use the megaphone of his American confrere; and from the shudder which the first sound of his voice must have sent through a less fastidious substance than mine I perceived that an address by megaphone I could not have borne; to that extreme of excess even my modernism could not go. As it was, there was an instant when I could have wished to be on foot, or even in a cab, with a red Baedeker in my hand; and yet, as the orator went on, I had to own that he was giving me a better account of the column than I could have got for myself out of the guide-book. He spoke first in French, with an Italian accent and occasionally an Italian idiom; then he spoke in English, and then in a German which suffered from his knowledge of English. He sat down, looking rather spent with his effort, and on the way to our next stop, at the Temple of Neptune, the agent examined us upon our necessities in the article of language. He himself spoke such good English that we could not do otherwise than declare that we could get on perfectly with an address in French. The German pair, perhaps from patriotic grudge, denied a working knowledge of the unfriendly tongue. The solitary on the back seat, being asked in his turn, graciously answered, \\\"Toutes les langues me sont egales,\\\" and thereafter we suffered with the orator only through French and German. The reply which decided the matter launched us upon yet wider conjecture regarding the unknown: was he a retired courier, a concierge out of place, a professor of languages on his holiday, or merely an amateur of philological studies? His declared proficiency was manifested in unexpected measure as we drove away from the Temple of Neptune on through the narrow street leading to it. Every motor has its peculiar note, and our car had something like the scream of a wild animal in pain, such as might have justly alarmed a stouter spirit than that of the poor little cab-horse which we encountered at the corner of this street. It reared, it plunged; when our chauffeur held us in it still backed and filled so dangerously that the mother and children overflowing the cab followed the example of the driver in spilling to the ground. Then our good international, the agent, jumped down and, mounting to the coachman's seat, took the reins and urged the horse forward, while its driver pulled it by the bridle. All was of no effect till the solitary of the back seat rose in his place and shouted to the frightened creature in choice American: \\\"What d' you mean, there? Come on! Come on, you fool!\\\" Then, as if it had been an \\\"impenitent mule\\\" in some far-distant Far-Western incarnation, this Eoman cab-horse recognized the voice of authority; it nerved itself against the imaginary danger, and came steadily forward; our agent regained his place, and we moved shriekingly on to the next object of interest. It was not quite the note blown from level tubes of brass in the progress of a conqueror, but we did not lack the cheers of a disinterested populace, which at several points impartially applauded our orator's French and German versions of his not always tacit Italian. Our height above the cheers helped preserve us from the sense of anything ironical in them, and there was an advantage in the outlook from our elevation which the wayfarer in cab or on foot can only imagine. No such wayfarer can realize the vast scope and compass of our excursion, which was but one of two excursions made on alternate afternoons by the Touring-Rome wagons. It included, perhaps not quite in the following order, after the Temple of Neptune, such objects of prime importance as the Palazzo Madama, where Catharine de' Medici once dwelt and where the Italian Senate now holds its sessions; the Fountain of Trevi, the Pantheon, the Piazza Navona, the new Palace of Justice and the Cavour monument beyond the Tiber, the Castle of Sant' Angelo, the Vatican and St. Peter's, the Janiculum and the Garibaldi monument on it, and the stupendous prospect of the city from that supreme top, the bridge that Horatius held in Macaulay's ballad, the island in the Tiber formed after the expulsion of the Tarquins by the river sand and drift catching on the seed-corn thrown into the stream from the fields consecrated to Mars, the Temple of Fortune, the once-supposed House of Rienzi, and the former Temple of Vesta; the Palatine Hill and the Aventine Hill, the Circus Maximus, the Colosseum, the Campidoglio, the Theatre of Marcellus, the worst slum in Rome, where the worst boy in Rome, flown with Carnival, will try to board your passing car; back to Piazza Colonna through Piazza Monte Citerio, where the Italian House of Deputies meets in the plain old palace of the same name. The mere mention of these storied places will kindle in the reader's fancy a fire which he will feel all the need of if ever he verifies my account of them in touring Rome on so cold an afternoon as that of our excursion. The wind rose with our ascent of every elevation, if it did not fall with our return to a lower level; on the Janiculum it blew a blizzard in which the incongruous ilexes and laurels bowed and writhed, and some groups of almond-trees in their pale bloom on a distant upland mocked us with a derisive image of spring. At the foot of the steps to the Campidoglio, where some of our party dismounted to go up and view the statue of Marcus Aurelius, it was so cold that nothing but the sense of a strong common interest prevented those who remained from persuading the chauffeur to go on without the sight-seers. But we forbore, both because we knew we were then very near the end of our tour, and because we felt it would have been cruel to abandon the lady who had got out of the car only by turning herself sidewise and could not have made her way home on foot without sufferings which would justly have brought us to shame. Certain idle particulars will always cling to the memory which lets so many ennobling facts slip from it; and I find myself helpless against the recollection of this poor lady's wearing a thick motoring-veil which no curiosity could pierce, but which, when she lifted it, revealed a complexion of heated copper and a gray mustache such as nature vouchsafes to few women. The crowd, which thickened most in the Piazza di Venezia, had grown more and more carnivalesque in attire and behavior. We had been obliged to avoid the more densely peopled streets because, as our international explained, if the car had slowed at any point the revellers would have joined our excursion of their own initiative and accompanied us to the end in overwhelming numbers. They wellnigh blocked the entrance of the Corso when we got back to it, and the cafe where we had agreed to have tea was so packed that our gay escapade began to look rather gloomy in the retrospect. But suddenly a table was vacated; a waiter was caught, in the vain attempt to ignore us, and given such a comprehensive order that we could see respect kindling in his eyes, and before we could reasonably have hoped it be spread before us tea and bread and butter and tarts and little cakes, while scores of hungry spectators stood round and flatteringly envied us. In this happy climax our adventure showed as a royal progress throughout. We counted up the wonders of our three hours' course in an absolutely novel light; and we said that touring Rome was a thing not only not to be despised, but to be forever proud of. For myself, I decided that if I were some poor hurried fellow-countryman of mine, doing Europe in a month and obliged to scamp Rome with a couple of days, I would not fail to spend two of them in what I must always think of as a triumphal chariot. I resolved to take the second excursion, not the next day perhaps, but certainly the day after the next, and complete the most compendious impression of ancient, mediaeval, and modern Rome that one can have; but the firmest resolution sometimes has not force to hold one to it. The second excursion remains for a second sojourn, when perhaps I may be able to solve the question whether I was moved by a fine instinct of proportion or by mere innate meanness in giving our orator at parting just two francs in recognition of his eloquence. No one else, indeed, gave him anything, and he seemed rather surprised by my tempered munificence. It might have been mystically adjusted to the number of languages he used in addressing us; if he had held to three languages I might have made it three francs; but now I shall never be certain till I take the second excursion with a company which imperatively requires English as well as French and German, and with no solitary in yellow gloves to whom all languages are alike. To this end I ought to have thrown a copper coin into the Fountain of Trevi as we passed it. You may return to Rome without doing this, but it is well known that if you do it you are sure to come back. The Fountain of Trevi is alone worth coming back for, and I could not see that it poured scanter streams than it formerly poured over brimming brinks or from the clefts of the artificial rocks that spread in fine disorder about the feet of its sea-gods and sea-horses; but they who mourn the old papal rule accuse the present Italian government of stinting the supply of water. To me there seemed no stint of water in any of the fountains of Rome. In some a mere wasteful spilth seems the sole design of the artist, as in the Fontana Paolina on the Janiculum, where the cold wash of its deluge seemed to add a piercing chill to our windy afternoon. The other fountains have each a quaint grace or absolute charm or pleasing absurdity, whether the waters shower over groups of more or less irrelevant statuary in their basins or spout into the air in columns unfurling flags of spray and keeping the pavement about them green with tender mould. The most sympathetic is the Fountain of the Triton, who blows the water through his wreathed horn and on the coldest day seems not to mind its refluent splash on his mossy back; in fact, he seems rather to like it. \\nHe is one of many tritons, rivers, sea-gods, and aqueous allegories similarly employed in Rome and similarly indifferent to what flesh and blood might find the hardship of their calling. I had rashly said to myself that their respective fountains needed the sun on them to be just what one could wish, but the first gray days taught me better. Then the thinly clouded sky dropped a softened light over their glitter and sparkle and gave them a spirituality as much removed from the suggestion of physical cold as any diaphanous apparition would suggest. Then they seemed rapt into a finer beauty than that of earth, though I will not pretend that they were alike beautiful. No fountain can be quite ugly, but some fountains can be quite stupid, like, for instance, those which give its pretty name to the Street of the Four Fountains and which consist of two extremely plain Virtues and two very dull old Rivers, diagonally dozing at each other over their urns in niches of the four converging edifices. They are not quite so idiotic under their disproportionate foliage as the conventional Egyptian lions of the Fountain of Moses, with manes like the wigs of so many lord chancellors, and with thin streams of water drooling from the tubes between their lips. But these are the exceptional fountains; there are few sculptured or architectural designs which the showering or spouting water does not retrieve from error; and in Rome the water (deliciously potable) is so abundant that it has force to do almost anything for beauty, even where, as in the Fontana Paolina, it is merely a torrent tumbling over a facade. It is lavished everywhere; in the Piazza Navona alone there are three fountains, but then the Piazza Navona is very long, and three fountains are few enough for it, even though one is that famous Fountain of Bernini, in which he has made one of the usual rivers - the Nile, I believe - holding his hand before his eyes in mock terror of the ungainly facade of a rival architect's church opposite, lest it shall fall and crush him. That, however, is the least merit of the fountain; and without any fountain the Piazza Navona would be charming; it is such a vast lake of sunshine and is so wide as well as long, and is so mellowed with such rich browns and golden grays in the noble edifices. I do not know, now, what all the edifices are, but there are churches, more than one, and palaces, and the reader can find their names in any of the guidebooks. If I were buying piazzas in Rome I should begin with the Navona, but there are enough to suit all purses and tastes. The fountains would be thrown in, I suppose, along with the churches and palaces; but I really never inquired, and, in fact, not having carried out my plan of visiting them all, I am in no position to advise intending purchasers. What I can say is that if you are in a hurry to inspect, that kind of property, and in immediate need of a piazza, you cannot do better than take the wagon for touring Rome. In two days you can visit every piazza worth having, including the Piazza di Spagna, where there is a fountain in the form of a marble galley in which you can embark for any fairyland you like, through the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. Come to think of it, I am not so sure but I would as soon have the Piazza del Popolo as the Piazza Navona. If the fountains are not so fine, they are still very fine, and the Pincian Hill overtops one side of the place, with foliaged drives and gardened walks descending into it. Everything of importance that did not happen elsewhere in Rome seems to have happened in the Piazza del Popolo, and I may name as a few of its attractions for investors the facts that it was here Sulla's funeral pyre was kindled; that Nero was buried on the left side of it, and out of his tomb grew a huge walnut-tree, the haunt of demoniacal crows till the Madonna appeared to Paschal II. and bade him cut it down; that the arch-heretic Luther sojourned in the Augustinian convent here while in Rome; that the dignitaries of Church and State received Christina of Sweden here when, after her conversion, she visited the city; that Lucrezia Borgia celebrated her betrothal in one of the churches; that it used to be a favorite place for executing brigands, whose wives then became artists' models, and whose sons, if they were like Cardinal Antonelli, became princes of the Church. So I learn from Hare in his Walks in Rome, and, if he enables me to boast the rivalry of the Piazza Navona in no such array of merits, still I will not deny my love for it. Certainly it was not a favorite place for executing brigands, but the miracle which saved St. Agnes from, cruel shame was wrought in the vaulted chambers under the church of her name there, and that is something beyond all the wonders of the Piazza del Popolo for its pathos and for its poetry. But, if the Piazza Navona had no other claim on me, I should find a peculiar pleasure in the old custom of stopping the escapes from its fountains and flooding with water the place I saw flooded with sun, for the patricians to wade and drive about in during the very hot weather and eat ices and drink coffee, while the plebeians looked sumptuously down on them from the galleries built around the lake. \\n\\nXI. IN AND ABOUT THE VATICAN \\nIt would be a very bold or very incompetent observer of the Roman situation who should venture upon a decided opinion of the relations of the monarchy and the papacy. You hear it said with intimations of special authority in the matter, that both king and pope are well content with the situation, and it is clearly explained how and why they are so; but I did not understand how or why at the moment of the explanation, or else I have now forgotten whatever was clear in it. I believe, however, it was to the effect that the pope willingly remained self-prisoned in the Vatican because, if he came out, he might not only invalidate a future claim upon the sovereign dignity which the Italian occupation had invaded, but he might incur risks from the more unfriendly extremists which would at least be very offensive. On his part, it was said that the king used the embarrassment occasioned by the pope's attitude as his own defence against the anti-Clericals, who otherwise would have urged him to far more hostile measures with the Church. The king and the pope were therefore not very real enemies, it was said by those who tried to believe themselves better informed than others. To the passing or tarrying stranger the situation does not offer many dramatic aspects. When you are going to St. Peter's, if you will look up at the plain wall of the Vatican palace you will see two windows with their shutters open, and these are the windows of the rooms where Pius X. lives, a voluntary captive; the closed blinds are those of the rooms where Leo XIII. died, a voluntary captive. Whatever we think of the wisdom or the reason of the papal protest against the occupation of the States of the Church by the Italian people, these windows have their pathos. The pope immures himself in the Vatican and takes his walks in the Vatican gardens, whose beauty I could have envied him, if he had not been a prisoner, when I caught a glimpse of them one morning, with the high walls of their privet and laurel alleys blackening in the sun. But otherwise the severest Protestant could not cherish so unkind a feeling toward the gentle priest whom all men speak well of for his piety and humility. It is a touching fact of his private life that his three maiden sisters, who wish to be as near him as they can, have their simple lodging over a shop for the sale of holy images in a street opening into the Piazza of St. Peter's. We all know that they are of a Venetian family neither rich nor great; their pride and joy is solely in him, as it well might be, and it is said that when they come to hear him in some high function at the Sistine Chapel their rapture of affection and devotion is as evident as it is sweet and touching. Their relation to him is the supremely poetic fact of a situation which even one who knows of it merely by hearsay cannot refuse to feel. The tragical effect of the situation is in the straining and sundering of family ties among those who take one side or the other in the difference of the monarchy and papacy. I do not know how equally Roman society, in the large or the small sense, is divided into the Black of the Papists and the White of the Monarchists (for the mediaeval names of Neri and Bianchi are revived in the modern differences), but one cannot help hearing of instances in which their political and religious opinions part fathers and sons and mothers and daughters. These are promptly noted to the least-inquiring foreigner, and his imagination is kindled by the attribution of like variances to the members of the reigning family, who are reported respectively blacker and whiter if they are not as positively black or white as the nobles. Some of these are said to meet one another only in secret across the gulf that divides them openly; but how far the cleavage may descend among other classes I cannot venture to conjecture; I can only testify to some expressions of priest-hatred which might have shocked a hardier heretical substance than mine. One Sunday we went to the wonderful old Church of San Clemente, which is built three deep into the earth or high into the air, one story above or below the other, in the three successive periods of imperial, mediaeval, and modern Rome. It was the day when the church is illuminated, and the visitors come with their Baedekers and Hares and Murrays to identify its antiquities of architecture and fresco; it was full of people, and, if I fancied an unusual proportion of English-speaking converts among them, that might well have been, since the adjoining convent belongs to the Irish Dominicans. But I carried with me through all the historic and artistic interest of the place the sensation left by two inscriptions daubed in black on the white convent wall next the church. One of these read: \\\"VV. la Repubblica\\\" (Long live the Republic), and the other: \\\"M. ai Preti\\\" (Death to the Priests). No attempt had been made to efface them, and as they expressed an equal hatred for the monarchy and the papacy, neither laity nor clergy may have felt obliged to interfere. Perhaps, however, it was rightly inferred that the ferocity of one inscription might be best left to counteract the influence of the other. I know that with regard to the priests you experience some such effect from the atrocious attacks in the chief satirical paper of Rome, The name of this paper was given me, with a deprecation not unmixed with recognition of its cleverness, by an Italian friend whom I was making my creditor for some knowledge of Roman journalism; and the sole copy of it which I bought was handed to me with a sort of smiling abhorrence by the kindly old kiosk woman whom I liked best to buy my daily papers of. When I came to look it through, I made more and more haste, for its satire of the priests was of an indecency so rank that it seemed to offend the nose as well as the eye. To turn from the paper was easy, but from the fact of its popularity a painful impression remained. It was not a question of whether the priests were so bad as all that, but whether its many readers believed them so, or believed them bad short of it, in the kind of wickedness they were accused of. There can be no doubt of the constant rancor between the Clericals and the Radicals in their different phases throughout Italy. There can be almost no doubt that the Radicals will have their way increasingly, and that if, for instance, the catechism is kept in the public schools this year, it will be cast out some other year not far hence. Much, of course, depends upon whether the status can maintain itself. It is, like the status everywhere and always, very anomalous; but it is difficult to imagine either the monarchy or the papacy yielding at any point. Apparently the State is the more self-assertive of the two, but this is through the patriotism which is the political life of the people. It must always be remembered that when the Italians entered Rome and made it the capital of their kingdom they did not drive out the French troops, which had already been withdrawn; they drove out the papal troops, the picturesque and inefficient foreign volunteers who remained behind. Every memorial of that event, therefore, is a blow at the Church, so far as the Church is identified with the lost temporal power. One of the chief avenues is named Twenty-second September Street because the national troops entered Rome on that date; the tablets on the Porta Pia where they entered, the monument on the Pincio to the Cairoli brothers, who died for Italy; the statues of Garibaldi, of Cavour, of Victor Emmanuel everywhere painfully remind the papacy of its lost sovereignty. But the national feeling has gone in its expression beyond and behind the patriotic occupation of Rome; and no one who suffered conspicuously, at any time in the past, for freedom of thought through the piety of the fallen power is suffered to be forgotten. On its side the Church enters its perpetual protest in the self-imprisonment of the pope; and here and there, according to its opportunity, it makes record of what it has suffered from the State. For instance, at St. John Lateran, which theoretically forms part of the Leonine City of the Popes and is therefore extraterritorial to Italy, a stretch of wall is suffered to remain scarred by the cannon-shot which the monarchy fired when it took Rome from the papacy. Doubtless there are other monuments of the kind, but their enumeration would not throw greater light on a situation which endures with no apparent promise of change. The patience of the Church is infinite; it lives and it outlives. Remembering that Arianism was older than Protestantism when Catholicism finally survived it, we must not be surprised if the Roman Church shall hold out against the Italian State not merely decades, but centuries. In the meanwhile to its children from other lands it means Rome above all the other Romes; and on us, its step-children of different faiths or unfaiths, its prison-house - if we choose so to think of the Vatican - has a supreme claim, if we love the sculpture of pagan Rome or the painting of Christian Rome. We swarm to its galleries in every variety of nationality, with guide-books in every tongue, and we are very queer, for the most part, to any one of our number who can sufficiently exteriorate himself to get the rest of us in perspective. It is probably well that most of us do not stagger under any great knowledge of the crushing history of the place, which has been the scene of the most terrible experiences of the race, the most touching, the most august. Provisionally ignorant, at least, we begin to appear at the earliest practicable hour before the outermost stairway of the Vatican, and, while the Swiss Guards still have on their long, blue cloaks to keep their black and yellow legs warm, mount to the Sistine Chapel. Here we help instruct one another, as we stand about or sit about in twos and threes or larger groups, reading aloud from our polyglot Baedekers while we join in identifying the different facts. Here, stupendously familiar, whether we have seen it before or not, is Michelangelo's giant fresco of the Judgment, as prodigious as we imagined or remembered it; here are his mighty Prophets and his mighty Sibyls; and here below them, in incomparably greater charm, are the frescos of Botticelli, with the grace of his Primavera playing through them all like a strain of music and taking the soul with joy. \\nIt is the same crowd in the Raphael Stanze, but rather silenter, for by now we have taught ourselves enough from our Baedekers at least to read them under our breaths, and we talk low before the frescos and the canvases. Some of us are even mute in the presence of the School of Athens, whatever reserves we may utter concerning the Transfiguration. If we are honest, we more or less own what our impressions really are from those other famous works, concerning which our impressions are otherwise altogether and inexpressibly unimportant; it is a question of ethics and not aesthetics, as most of our simple-hearted company suppose it to be; and, if we are dishonest, we pretend to have felt and thought things at first-hand from them which we have learned at second-hand from our reading. I will confess, for my small part, that I had more pleasure in the coloring and feeling of some of the older canvases and in here and there a Titian than in all the Raphaels in the Stanze of his name. I was not knowing his works for the first time; no one perhaps does that, such is the multiplicity of the copies of them; and I vividly remembered them from my acquaintance with the originals four decades before, as I had remembered the Michelangelos; but in their presence and in the presence of so many other masterpieces in the different rooms, with their horrible miracles and atrocious martyrdoms, I realized as for the first time what a bloody religion ours was. It was such relief, such rest, to go from those broilings and beheadings and crucifixions and Sayings and stabbings into the long, tranquil aisles of the museum where the marble men and women, created for earthly immortality by Greek art, welcomed me to their serenity and sanity. The earlier gods might have been the devils which the early Christians fancied them, but they did not look it; they did not look as if it was they that had loosed the terrors upon mankind out of which the true faith has but barely struggled at last, now when its relaxing grasp seems slipping from the human mind. I remembered those peaceful pagans so perfectly that I could have gone confidently to this or that and hailed him friend; and though I might not have liked to claim the acquaintance of all of them in the flesh, in the marble I fled to it as refuge from the cruel visions of Christian art. If this is perhaps saying too much, I wish also to hedge from the wholesale censure of my fellow-sight-seers which I may have seemed to imply. They did not prevail so clutteringly in the sculpture galleries as in the Sistine Chapel and the Stanze. One could have the statues as much to one's self as one liked; there were courts with murmuring fountains in them; and there was a view of Rome from a certain window, where no fellow-tourist intruded between one and the innumerable roofs and domes and towers, and the heights beyond whose snows there was nothing but blue sky. It was a beautiful morning, with a sun mild as English summer, which did not prevent the afternoon from turning cold with wind and raining and hailing and snowing. This in turn did not keep off a fine red sunset, with an evening star of glittering silver that brightened as the sunset faded. At Rome the weather can be of as many minds in March as in April at New York. But through all one's remembrance of the Roman winter a sentiment of spring plays enchantingly, like that grace of Botticelli's Primavera in his Sistine frescos. It is not a sentiment of summer, though it is sometimes a summer warmth which you feel, and except in the steam-heated hotels it does not penetrate to the interiors. In the galleries and the churches you must blow your nails if you wish to thaw your fingers, but, if you go out-of-doors, there is a radiant imitation of May awaiting you. She takes you by your thick glove and leads you in your fur-lined overcoat through sullen streets that open upon sunny squares, with fountains streaming into the crystal air, and makes you own that this is the Italian winter as advertised - that is, if you are a wanderer and a stranger; if you are an Italian and at home you keep in the out-door warmth, but shun the sun, and in-doors you wrap up more thickly than ever, or you go to bed if you have a more luxurious prejudice against shivering. If you are a beggar, as you very well may be in Rome, you impart your personal heat to a specific curbstone or the spot which you select as being most in the path of charity, and cling to it from dawn till dark. Or you acquire somehow the rights of a chair just within the padded curtain of a church, and do not leave it till the hour for closing. The Roman beggars are of all claims upon pity, but preferably I should say they were blind, and some of these are quite young girls, and mostly rather cheerful. But the very gayest beggar I remember was a legless man at the gate of the Vatican Museum; the saddest was a sullen dwarf on the way to this cripple, whose gloom a donative even of twenty-five centessimi did not suffice to abate. \\n\\nXII. SUPERFICIAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONJECTURES \\nIt had seemed to me that in the afternoons of the old papal times, so dear to foreigners who never knew them, I used to see a series of patrician ladies driving round and round on the Pincio, reclining in their landaus and shielding their complexions from the November suns of the year 1864 with the fringed parasols of the period. In the doubt which attends all recollections of the past, after age renders us uncertain of the present, I hastened on my second Sunday at Rome in February, 1908, to enjoy this vision, if possible. I found the Pincio unexpectedly near; I found the sunshine; I found the familiar winter warmth which in Southern climates is so unlike the summer warmth in ours; but the drive which I had remembered as a long ellipse had narrowed to a little circle, where one could not have driven round faster than a slow trot without danger of vertigo. I did not find that series of apparent principessas or imaginable marchesas leaning at their lovely lengths in their landaus. I found in overwhelming majority the numbered victorias, which pass for cabs in Rome, full of decent tourists, together with a great variety of people on foot, but not much fashion and no swells that my snobbish soul could be sure of. There was, indeed, one fine moment when, at a retired point of the drive, I saw two private carriages drawn up side by side in their encounter, with two stout old ladies, whom I decided to be dowager countesses at the least, partially projected from their opposing windows and lost in a delightful exchange, as I hoped, of scandal. But the only other impressive personality was that of an elderly, obviously American gentleman, in the solitary silk hat and long frock-coat of the scene. There were other Americans, but none so formal; the English were in all degrees of informality down to tan shoes and at least one travelling-cap. The women's dress, whether they were on foot or in cabs, was not striking, though more than half of them were foreigners and could easily have afforded to outdress the Italians, especially the work people, though these were there in their best. \\nThere was a band-stand in the space first reached by the promenaders, and there ought clearly to have been a band, but I was convinced that there was to be none by a brief colloquy between one of the cab-drivers (doubtless goaded to it by his fair freight) and the gentlest of Roman policemen, whose response was given in accents of hopeful compassion: CABMAN: \\\"Musica, no?\\\" (No music?) POLICEMAN: \\\"Forse l' avremo oramai\\\" (Perhaps we shall have it presently.) We did not have it at all that Sunday, possibly because it was the day after the assassination of the King of Portugal, and the flags were at half-mast everywhere. So we went, such of us as liked, to the parapet overlooking the Piazza del Popolo, and commanding one of those prospects of Rome which are equally incomparable from every elevation. I, for my part, made the dizzying circuit of the brief drive on foot in the dark shadows of the roofing ilexes (if they are ilexes), and then strolled back and forth on the paths set thick with plinths bearing the heads of the innumerable national great - the poets, historians, artists, scientists, politicians, heroes - from the ancient Roman to the modern Italian times. I particularly looked up the poets of the last hundred years, because I had written about them in one of my many forgotten books, till I fancied a growing consciousness in them at this encounter with an admirer; they, at least, seemed to remember my book. Then I went off to the cafe overlooking them in their different alleys, and had tea next a man who was taking lemon instead of milk in his. Here I was beset with an impassioned longing to know whether he was a Russian or American, since the English always take milk in their tea, but I could not ask, and when I had suffered my question as long as I could in his presence I escaped from it, if you can call it escaping, to the more poignant question of what it would be like to come, Sunday after Sunday, to the Pincio, in the life-long voluntary exile of some Americans I knew, who meant to spend the rest of their years under the spell of Rome. I thought, upon the whole, that it would be a dull, sad fate, for somehow we seem born in a certain country in order to die in it, and I went home, to come again other Sundays to the Pincio, but not all the Sundays I promised myself. On one of these Sundays I found Roman boys playing an inscrutable game among the busts of their storied compatriots, a sort of \\\"I spy\\\" or \\\"Hide and go whoop,\\\" counting who should be \\\"It\\\" in an Italian version of \\\"Oneary, ory, ickory, an,\\\" and then scattering in every direction behind the plinths and bushes. They were not more molestive than boys always are in a world which ought to be left entirely to old people, and I could not see that they did any harm. But somebody must have done harm, for not only was a bust here and there scribbled over in pencil, but the bust of Machiavelli had its nose freshly broken off in a jagged fracture that was very hurting to look at. This may have been done by some mistaken moralist, who saw in the old republican adviser of princes that enemy of mankind which he was once reputed to be. At any rate, I will not attribute the mutilation to the boys of Rome, whom I saw at other times foregoing so many opportunities of mischief in the Villa Bor-ghese. One of them even refused money from me there when I misunderstood his application for matches and offered him some coppers. He put my tip aside with a dignified wave of his hand and a proud backward step; and, indeed, I ought to have seen from the flat, broad cap he wore that he was a school-boy of civil condition. The Romans are not nearly so dramatic as the Neapolitans or Venetians or even as the Tuscans; but once in the same pleasance I saw a controversy between school-boys which was carried on with an animation full of beauty and finish. They argued back and forth, not violently, but vividly, and one whom I admired most enforced his reasons with charming gesticulations, whirling from his opponents with quick turns of his body and many a renunciatory retirement, and then facing about and advancing again upon the unconvinced. I decided that his admirable drama had been studied from the histrionics of his mother in domestic scenes; and, if I had been one of those other boys, I should have come over to his side instantly. The Roman manners vary from Roman to Roman, just as our own manners, if we had any, would vary from New-Yorker to New-Yorker. Zola thinks the whole population is more or less spoiled with the conceit of Rome's ancient greatness, and shows it. One could hardly blame them if this were so; but I did not see any strong proof of it, though I could have imagined it on occasion. I should say rather that they had a republican simplicity of manner, and I liked this better in the shop people and work people than the civility overflowing into servility which one finds among the like folk, for instance, in England. I heard complaints from foreigners that the old-time deference of the lower classes was gone, but I did not miss it. Once in a cafe, indeed, the waiter spoke to me in Voi (you) instead of Lei (lordship), but the Neapolitans often do this, and I took it for a friendly effort to put me at my ease in a strange tongue with a more accustomed form. We were trying to come together on the kind of tea I wanted, but we failed, if I wanted it strong, for I got it very weak and tepid. I thought another day that it would be stronger if I could get it brought hotter, but it was not, and so I went no more to a place where I was liable to be called You instead of Lordship and still get weak tea. I think this was a mistake of mine and a loss, for at that cafe I saw some old-fashioned Italian types drinking their black coffee at afternoon tea-time out of tumblers, and others calling for pen and ink and writing letters, and ladies sweetly asking for newspapers and reading them there; and I ought to have continued coming to study them. As to my conjectures of republican quality in the Romans, I had explicit confirmation from a very intelligent Italian who said of the anomalous social and political situation in Rome: \\\"We Italians are naturally republicans, and, if it were a question of any other reigning family, we should have the republic. But we feel that we owe everything, the very existence of the nation, to the house of Savoy, and we are loyal to it in our gratitude. Especially we are true to the present king.\\\" It is known, of course, that Menotti Garibaldi continues the republican that his father always was, but I heard of his saying that, if a republic were established, Victor Emmanuel III. would be overwhelmingly chosen the first president. It is the Socialists who hold off unrelentingly from the monarchy, and not the republicans, as they can be differenced from them. One of the well-known Roman anomalies is that some members of the oldest families are or have been Socialists; and such a noble was reproached because he would not go to thank the king in recognition of some signal proof of his public spirit and unselfish patriotism. He owned the generosity of the king's behavior and his claim upon popular acknowledgment, but he said that he had taught the young men of his party the duty of ignoring the monarchy, and he could not go counter to the doctrine he had preached. If I venture to speak now of a very extraordinary trait of the municipal situation at Rome, it must be without the least pretence to authority or to more than such superficial knowledge as the most incurious visitor to Rome can hardly help having. In the capital of Christendom, where the head of the Church dwells in a tradition of supremacy hardly less Italian than Christian, the syndic, or mayor, is a Jew, and not merely a Jew, but an alien Jew, English by birth and education, a Londoner and an Oxford man. More yet, he is a Freemason, which in Italy means things anathema to the Church, and he is a very prominent Freemason. With reference to the State, his official existence, though not inimical, is through the fusion of the political parties which elected him hardly less anomalous. This combination overthrew the late Clerical city government, and it included Liberals, Republicans, Socialists, and all the other anti-Clericals. Whatever liberalism or republicanism means, socialism cannot mean less than the economic solution of regality and aristocracy in Europe, and in Italy as elsewhere. It does not mean the old-fashioned revolution; it means simply the effacement of all social differences by equal industrial obligations. So far as the Socialists can characterize it, therefore, the actual municipal government of Rome is as antimonarchical as it is antipapal. But the syndic of Rome is a man of education, of culture, of intelligence, and he is evidently a man of consummate tact. He has known how to reconcile the warring elements, which made peace in his election, to one another and to their outside antagonists, to the Church and to the State, as well as to himself, in the course he holds over a very rugged way. His opportunities of downfall are pretty constant, it will be seen, when it is explained that if a measure with which he is identified fails in the city council it becomes his duty to resign, like the prime-minister of England in the like case with Parliament, But Mr. Nathan, who is as alien in his name as in his race and religion, and is known orally to the Romans as Signor Nahtahn, has not yet been obliged to resign. He has felt his way through every difficulty, and has not yet been identified with any fatally compromising measure. In such an extremely embarrassing predicament as that created by the conflict between the labor unions and the police early in April, and eventuating in the two days' strike, he knew how to do the wise thing and the right thing. As to the incident, he held his hand and he held his tongue, but he went to visit the wounded workmen in the hospital, and he condoled with their families. He was somewhat blamed for that, but his action kept for him the confidence of that large body of his supporters who earn their living with their hands. It is said that the common Romans do not willingly earn their living with their hands; that they like better being idle and, so far as they can, ornamental. In this they would not differ from the uncommon Romans, the moneyed, the leisured, the pedigreed classes, who reproach them for their indolence; but I do not know whether they are so indolent as all that or not. I heard it said that they no longer want work, and that when they get it they do not do it well - a supposed effect of the socialism which is supposed to have spoiled their manners. I heard it said more intelligently, as I thought, that they are not easily disciplined, and that they cannot be successfully associated in the industries requiring workmen to toil in large bodies together; they will not stand that. Also I heard it said, as I thought again rather intelligently, that where work is given them to do after a certain model, they will conform perfectly for the first three or four times; then their fatal creativeness comes into play, and they begin to better their instruction by trying to improve upon the patterns - that is, they are artists, not artisans. They must please their fancy in their work or they cannot do it well. From my own experience I cannot say whether this is generally or only sometimes true, but I can affirm that where they delayed or erred in their work they took their failure very amiably. I never saw sweeter patience than that of the Roman matron who had undertaken a small job of getting spots out of a garment, and who quite surpassed me in self-control when she announced, day after appointed day, that the work was not done yet or not done perfectly; she was politeness itself. On the other hand, some young ladies at a fashionable concert which the queen-mother honored with her presence did not seem very polite. They kept on their immense hats, as women still do in all public places on the European continent, and they seized as many chairs as they could for friends who did not come, and at supreme moments they stood up on their chairs and spoiled such poor chance of seeing the queen-mother as the stranger might have had. While the good King Umberto lived the stranger would have had many other chances, for it is said that the queen showed herself with him to the people at the windows of their palace every afternoon; but in her widowhood she lives retired, though now and then her carriage may be seen passing through the streets, with four special policemen on bicycles following it. These waited about the doorway of the concert-hall that afternoon and formed a very simple, if effective, guard. In fact, it might be said that in its relations with the popular life the reigning family could hardly be simpler. The present king and queen are not so much seen in public as King Umberto and Queen Margherita were, but it is known from many words and deeds that King Victor Emmanuel wishes to be the friend, if not the acquaintance, of his people. When it was proposed to push the present tunnel, with its walks and drives and trolley-lines, under the Quirinal Palace and gardens, so as to connect the two principal business quarters of the city, the king was notified that the noise and jar of the traffic in it might interfere with his comfort. He asked if the tunnel would be for the general advantage, and, when this could not be denied, he gave his consent in words to some such effect as \\\"That settles it.\\\" When the German Emperor last visited Rome he is said to have had some state question as to whether he should drive on a certain occasion to the Palatine with the king's horses or the pope's. He who told the story did not remember how the question was solved by the emperor, but he said, \\\"Our king walked.\\\" All this does not mean republican simplicity in the king; a citizen king is doubtless a contradiction in terms anywhere out of France, and even there Louis Philippe found the part difficult. But there is no doubt that the King of Italy means to be the best sort of constituional king, and, as he is in every way an uncommon man, he will probably succeed. One may fancy in him, if one likes, something of that almost touching anxiety of thoughtful Italians to be and to do all that they can for Italy, in a patriotism that seems as enlightened as it is devoted. If I had any criticism to make of such Italians it would be that they expected, or that they asked, too much of themselves. To be sure, they have a right to expect much, for they have done wonders with a country which, without great natural resources except of heart and brain, entered bankrupt into its national existence, and has now grown financially to the dimensions of its vast treasury building, with a paper currency at par and of equal validity with French and English money. If the industrial conditions in Italy were so bad as we compassionate outsiders have been taught to suppose, this financial change is one of the most important events accomplished in Europe since the great era of the racial unifications began. No one will pretend that there have not been great errors of administration in Italy, but apparently the Italians have known how to learn wisdom from their folly. There has been a great deal of industrial adversity; the cost of living has advanced; the taxes are very heavy, and the burdens are unequally adjusted; many speculators have been ruined, and much honestly invested money has been lost. But wages have increased with the prices and rents and taxes, and in a country where every ounce of coal that drives a wheel of production or transportation has to be brought a thousand miles manufactures and railroads have been multiplied. The state has now taken over the roads and has added their cost to that of its expensive army and navy, but no reasonable witness can doubt that the Italians will be equal to this as well as their other national undertakings. These in Rome are peculiarly difficult and onerous, because they must be commensurate with the scale of antiquity. In a city surviving amid the colossal ruins of the past it would be grotesque to build anything of the modest modern dimensions such as would satisfy the eye in other capitals. The Palace of Finance, at a time when Italian paper was at a discount almost equal to that of American paper during the Civil War, had to be prophetic of the present solvency in size. The yet-unfinished Palace of Justice (one dare not recognize its beauty above one's breath) must be planned so huge that the highest story had to be left off if the foundations were to support the superstructure; the memorial of Victor Emmanuel II. must be of a vastness in keeping with the monuments of imperial Rome, some of which it will partly obscure. Yet as the nation has grown in strength under burdens and duties, it will doubtless prove adequate to the colossal architectural enterprises of its capital. Private speculation in Rome brought disaster twenty-five years ago, but now the city has overflowed with new life the edifices that long stood like empty sepulchres, and public enterprises cannot finally fail; otherwise we should not be digging the Panama Canal or be trying to keep the New York streets in repair. We may confide in the ability of the Italians to carry out their undertakings and to pay the cost out of their own pockets. It is easy to criticise them, but we cannot criticise them more severely than they criticise themselves; and perhaps, as our censure cannot profit them, we might with advantage to ourselves, now and then, convert it into recognition of the great things they have accomplished. \\n\\nXIII. CASUAL IMPRESSIONS \\nThe day that we arrived in Rome the unclouded sun was yellow on the white dust of the streets, which is never laid by a municipal watering-cart, though sometimes it is sprinkled into mire from the garden-hose of the abutting hotels; and in my rashness I said that for Rome you want sun and you want youth. Yet there followed many gray days when my age found Rome very well indeed, and I would not have the septuagenarian keep away because he is no longer in the sunny sixties. He may see through his glasses some things hidden even from the eyes of the early forties. If he drives out beyond the Porta Pia, say, some bright afternoon, and notes how the avenue between the beautiful old villas is also bordered by many vacant lots advertised for sale as well as built up with pleasant new houses, he will be able to carry away with him the significant fact that a convenient and public-spirited trolley-line has the same suburban effect in Rome, Italy, as in Rome, New York. If he meets some squadrons of cavalry or some regiments of foot, in that military necessity of constant movement which the civilian can never understand, he may make the useful reflection that it is much better to have the troops out of the city than in it, and he can praise the wisdom of the Italian government accordingly. On the neighboring mountains the presence or absence of snow forms the difference between summer and winter in Rome, and will suggest the question whether, after all, our one continental weather is better than the many local weathers of Europe; and perhaps he will acquire national modesty in owning that there is something more picturesque in the indications of those azure or silvery tops than in his morning paper's announcement that there is or is not a lower pressure in the region of the lakes. At any rate, I would not have him note the intimations of such a drive at less worth than those of any more conventional fact of his Roman sojourn. If one is quite honest, or merely as honest as one may be with safety, one will often own to one's self that something merely incidental to one's purpose, in visiting this memorable place or that, was of greater charm and greater value than the fulfilment of a direct purpose. One happy morning I went, being in the vicinity, to renew the acquaintance with the Tarpeian Rock, which I had hastened to make on my first visit to Rome. I had then found it so far from such a frightfully precipitous height as I had led myself to expect that I came away and rather mocked it in print. But now, possibly because the years had moderated all my expectations in life, I thought the Tarpeian Rock very respectably steep and quite impressively lofty; either the houses at its foot had sunk with their chimneys and balconies, or the rock had risen, so that one could no longer be hurled from it with impunity. We looked at it from an arbor of the lovely little garden which we were let into beyond the top of the rock, and which was the pleasance of some sort of hospital. I think there were probably flowers there, since it was a garden, but what was best was the almond-tree covering the whole space with a roof of bloom, and in this roof a score of birds that sang divinely. \\nI am aware of bringing a great many birds into these papers; but really Rome would not be Rome without them; and I could not exaggerate their number or the sweetness of their song. They particularly abounded in the cloistered and gardened close of the Cistercian Convent, which three hundred years ago ensconsed itself within the ruinous Baths of Diocletian. I have no fable at hand to explain what seems the special preference of the birds for this garden; it is possibly an idiosyncrasy, something like that of the cats which make Trajan's Forum their favorite resort. All that I can positively say is that if I were a bird I would ask nothing better than to frequent the cypresses of that garden and tune my numbers for the entertainment of the audience of extraordinary monsters in the aisles below, which bea'in plinths of clipped privet and end marble heads of horses, bulls, elephants, rhinoceroses, and their like. I do not pretend to be exact in their nomination; they may be other animals; but I am sure of their attention to the birds. I am not quite so sure of the attention of the antique shapes in the rooms of the Ludovisi collection looking into the close. I fancy them preoccupied with the in-doors cold, so great in all Italian galleries, and scarcely tempered for them by the remote and solitary brazier over which the custodians take turns in stifling themselves. They cannot come down into the sun and song of the garden, to which the American tourist may return from visiting them, to thaw out his love of the beautiful. They are not so many or so famous as their marble brothers and sisters in the Vatican Museum, but the tourist should not miss seeing them. Neither should he miss any accessible detail of the environing ruins of the Diocletian Baths. Let him not think because they are so handy, and so next door, as it were, to the railway station where he arrives, and to Cook's office where he goes for his letters next morning, that they are of less merit than other monuments of imperial Rome. They are not only colossally vast, but they are singularly noble, as well as so admirably convenient. Because they are so convenient, the modern Romans have turned their cavernous immensity to account in the trades and industries, and have built them up in carpenters' and blacksmiths' and plumbers' shops, where there is a cheerful hammering and banging much better than the sullen silence of more remote and difficult ruins. In color they are a very agreeable reddish brown, though not so soft to the eye as the velvety masses of the Palatine, which at any distance great enough to obscure their excavation have a beauty like that of primitive nature. I do not know but you see these best from the glazed terrace of that restaurant on the Aventine which is the resort of the well-advised Romans and visitors, and from which you look across to the mount of fallen and buried grandeur over a champaign of gardens and orchards. All round is a landscape which I was not able to think of as less than tremendous, with the whole of Rome in it, and the snow-topped hills about it - a scene to which you may well give more than a moment from the varied company at the other tables, where English, German, French, and Americans, as well as Italians, are returning to the simple life in their enjoyment of the local dishes, washed down with golden draughts of local wine, served ciderwise in generous jugs. If your mind is, as ours was in that place, to drive farther and see the chapter-house of the Knights of Malta, clinging to the height over the Tiber, and looking up and down its yellow torrent and the black boats along the shore, with universal Rome melting into the distance, you must not fail to stop at the old, old Church of St. Sabina. You will naturally want to see this, not only because there in the cloister (as the ladies can ascertain at the window let into the wall for their dangerous eyes to peer through from the outside) is the successor of the orange-tree transplanted from the Holy Land by St. Dominic six or seven hundred years ago; not only because one of the doors of the church, covered with Bible stories, is thought the oldest wood-carving in the world, but also because there will be sitting in his white robes on a bench beside the nave an aged Dominican monk reading some holy book, with his spectacles fallen forward on his nose and his cowl fallen back on his neck, and his wide tonsure gleaming glacially in the pale light, whom nothing in the church or its visitors can distract from his devotions. It is very, very cold in there, but he probably would not, if he could, follow you into the warm outer world and on into the garden of the Knights, who came here after they had misruled Malta for centuries and finally rendered a facile submission to General Bonaparte of the French Republican army in 1798. Their fixing here cannot be called anything so vigorous as their last stand; but, without specific reference to the easy-chairs in their chapter-house, it may be fitly called their last seat; and, if it is true that none of plebeian blood may enjoy the order's privileges, the place will afford another of those satisfactions which the best of all possible worlds is always offering its admirers. Even if one were disposed to moralize the comfortable end of the poor Knights harshly, one must admit that their view of Rome is one of the unrivalled views, and that the glimpse of St. Peter's through the key-hole of their garden-gate is little short of tin-rivalled. I could not manage the glimpse myself, but I can testify to the unique character of the avenue of clipped box and laurel which the key-hole also commands. Lovers of the supernatural, of which I am the first, will like to be reminded, or perhaps instructed, that the Church of the Priory stands on the spot where Remus had a seance with the spiritual authorities and was advised against building Rome where he proposed, being shown only six vultures as against twelve that Romulus saw in favor of his chosen site. The fact gave the Aventine Hill the fame of bad luck, but any one may safely visit it now, after the long time that has passed. I do not, however, advise visiting it above any other place in Rome. What I always say is, take your chances with any or every time or place; you cannot fail of some impression which you will always like recurring to as characteristically delightful. For instance, I once walked home from the Piazza di Spagna with some carnival masks frolicking about me through the sun-shotten golden dust of the delicious evening air, and I had a pleasure from the experience which I shall never forget. It was as rich as that I got from the rosy twilight in which I wandered homeward another time from the Piazza di Venezia and found myself passing the Fountain of Trevi, and lingered long there and would not throw my penny into its waters because I knew I could not help coming back to Rome anyhow. Yet another time I was driving through a certain piazza where the peasants stand night long waiting to be hired by the proprietors who come to find them there, and suddenly the piety of the Middle Ages stood before me in the figure of the Brotherhood of the Misericordia, draped to the foot and hooded in their gray, unbleached linen. The brothers were ranged in a file at the doors of the church ready to visit the house of sickness or of mourning, barefooted, with their eyes showing spectrally through their masks and their hands coming soft and white out of their sleeves and betraying the lily class that neither toils nor spins and yet is bound, as in the past, to the poorest and humblest through the only Church that knows how to unite them in the offering and acceptance of reciprocal religious duties. In Rome, as elsewhere in Catholic countries, it seemed to me that the worshippers were mostly of the poorer classes and were mostly old women, but in the Church of the Jesuits I saw worshippers almost as well dressed as the average of our Christian Scientists, and in that church, whose name I forget, but which is in the wide street or narrow piazza below the windows of the palace where the last Stuarts lived and died, my ineradicable love of gentility was flattered and my faith in the final sanctification of good society restored by the sight of gentlemen coming to and going from prayer with their silk hats in their hands. The performance of ritual implies a certain measure of mechanism, and the wonder is that in the Catholic churches it is not more mechanical than it actually is. I was no great frequenter of functions, and I cannot claim that my superior spirituality was ever deeply wounded; sometimes it was even supported and consoled. I noted, without offence, in the Church of San Giuseppe how the young monk, who preached an eloquent sermon on the saint's life and character, exhausted himself before he exhausted his topic, and sat down between the successive heads of his discourse and took a good rest. It was the saint's day, which seemed more generally observed than any other saint's day in Rome, and his baroque church in Via Capo le Case was thronged with people, mostly poor and largely peasants, who were apparently not so fatigued by the preacher's shrill, hard delivery as he was himself. There were many children, whom their elders held up to see, and there was one young girl in a hat as wide as a barrel-head standing up where others sat, and blotting out the prospect of half the church with her flaring brim and flaunting feathers. The worshippers came and went, and while the monk preached and reposed a man crept dizzyingly round the cornice with a taper at the end of a long pole lighting the chandeliers, while two other men on the floor kindled the candles before the altars. As soon as their work was completed, the monk, as if he had been preaching against time, sat definitely down and left us to the rapture of the perfected splendor. The high-altar was canopied and curtained in crimson, fringed with gold, and against this the candle-flames floated like yellow flowers. Suddenly, amid the hush and expectance, a tenor voice pealed from the organ-loft, and a train of priests issued from the sacristy and elbowed and shouldered their way through the crowd to the high-altar, where their intoning, like so many \\\"Silver snarling trumpets 'gan to glide,\\\" and those flower-like flames and that tenor voice seemed to sing together, and all sense of mortal agency in the effect was lost. \\nHow much our pale Northern faith has suffered from the elimination of the drama which is so large an element in the worship of the South could not be conjectured without offence to both. Drama I have said, but, if I had said opera, it would have been equally with the will merely to recognize the fact and not to censure it. Many have imagined a concert of praise in heaven, and portrayed it as a spectacle of which the elder Christian worship seems emulous. Go, therefore, to Rome, dear fellow-Protestant, with any measure of ignorance short of mine, but leave as much of your prejudice behind you as you can. You are not more likely to become a convert because of your tolerance; in fact, you may be the safer for it; and it will prepare you for a gentler pleasure than you would otherwise enjoy in the rites and ceremonies which seem exotic in our wintrier world, but which are here native to the climate, or, at least, could not have had their origin under any but oriental or meridional skies. The kindlier mood will help you to a truer appreciation of that peculiar keeping of the churches which the stranger is apt to encounter in his approach. Be tender of the hapless mendicants at the door; they are not there for their pleasure, those blind and halt and old. Be modestly receptive of the good office of the whole tribe of cicerones, of custodians, of sacristans; they can save you time, which, though it is not quite the same as money, even in Rome is worth saving, and are the repository of many rejected fables waiting to be recognized as facts again. I, for instance, committed the potential error of wholly rejecting with scorn the services of an authorized guide to the Church of St. John Lateran because he said the tariff was three francs. But after wandering, the helpless prey of my own Baedeker, up and down the huge temple, I was glad to find him waiting my emergence where I had left him, in the church porch, one of the most pathetic figures that ever wrung the remorseful heart. His poor black clothes showed the lustre of inveterate wear; his waistcoat would have been the better for a whole bottle of benzine; his shoes, if they did not share the polish of those threadbare textures, reciprocated the effect of his broken-spirited cuffs and collar, and the forlorn gentility of his hat. His beard had not been shaved for three days; I do not know why, but doubtless for as good a reason as that his shirt had not been washed for seven. It was with something like a cry for pardon of my previous brutality that I now closed with his unabated demand of a three-franc fee, and we went with him wherever he would, from one holy edifice to another of those that constitute the church; but I will not ask the reader to follow us in the cab which he mounted into with us, but which would not conveniently hold four. Let him look it all up in the admirably compendious pages of Hare and Murray, and believe, if he can, that I missed nothing of that history and mystery. If I speak merely of the marvellous baptistery, it is doubtless not because the other parts were not equally worthy of my wonder, but because I would not have even an enemy miss the music of the singing doors, mighty valves of bronze which, when they turn upon their hinges, emit a murmur of grief or a moan of remorse for whatever heathen uses they once served the wicked Caracalla at his baths. Not to have heard their rich harmony would be like not having heard the echo in the baptistery of Pisa, a life-long loss. Heaven knows how punctiliously our guide would have acquainted us with every particular of the Lateran group, which for a thousand years before the Vatican was the home of the popes. We begged off from this and that, but even indolence like mine would not spare itself the sight of the Scala Santa. That was another of the things which I distinctly remembered from the year 1864, and I did not find the spectacle of the modern penitents covering the holy steps different in 1908. Now, as then, there was something incongruous in their fashions and aspirations, but one could not doubt that it was a genuine piety that nerved them to climb up and down the hard ascent on their knees, or, at the worst, that it was good exercise. Still, I would rather leave my reader the sense of that most noble facade of the church, with its lofty balustraded entablature, where the gigantic Christ and ten of his saints look out forever to the Alban hills. \\n\\nXIV. TIVOLI AND FRASCATI \\nOne of the most agreeable illusions of travel is a sort of expectation that if you will give objects of interest time enough they will present themselves to you, and, if they will not actually come to you in your hotel, will happen in your way when you go out. This was my notion of the right way of seeing Rome, but, as the days of my winter passed, so many memorable monuments failed not merely to seek me out, but stiffly held aloof from me in my walks abroad, that I began to feel anxious lest I should miss them altogether. I had, for instance, always had the friendliest curiosity concerning Tivoli and Frascati as the two most amiable Roman neighborhoods, and hoped to see both of them in some informal and casual sort; but they persisted so long in keeping off on * their respective hills that I saw something positive on my part must be done. Clearly I must make the advances; and so when, one morning of mid-March, a friend sent to ask if we would not motor out to Tivoli with him and his family, I closed eagerly with the chance of a compromise which would save feeling all round. My friend has never yet known how he was bringing Tivoli and me together after a mutual diffidence, but, as he was a poet, I am sure he will be glad to know now. Our road across the Campagna lay the greater part of the distance beside the tram-line, but at other points parted with it and stretched rough, if lately mended, and smooth, if long neglected, between the wide, lonely pastures and narrow drill-sown fields of wheat. The Campagna is said to be ploughed only once in five years by the peasants for the proprietors, who have philosophized its fertility as something that can be better restored by the activities of nature in that time than by phosphates in less. As they are mostly Roman patricians, they have always felt able to wait; but now it is said that northern Italian capital and enterprise are coming in, and the Campagna will soon be cropped every season, though as yet its chief yield seemed to be the two-year-old colts we saw browsing about. For some distance we had the company of the different aqueducts, but their broken stretches presently ceased altogether, and then for other human association we had, besides the fencings of the meadows, only the huts and shelters scattered among the grassy humps and hollows. There were more humps than I had remembered of the Campagna, and probably they were the rounded and turfed-over chunks of antiquity which otherwhere showed their naked masonry unsoft-ened and unfriended by the passing centuries. At times a dusty hamlet, that seemed to crop up from the roadside ditches, followed us a little way with children that shouted for joy in our motor and dogs that barked for pleasure in their joy. Women with the square linen head-dress of the Roman peasants stood and stared, and sallow men, each with his jacket hanging from one of his shoulders, seemed stalking backward from us as we whirled by. Here and there we scared a horse or a mule, but we did not so much as run over a hen; and both man and beast are becoming here, as elsewhere, reconciled to the automobile. Now and then a carter would set his team slantwise in our course and stay us out of good-humored deviltry, and when he let us pass would fling some chaff to the fresh-faced English youngster who was our chauffeur. \\\"I suppose you don't always understand what those fellows say,\\\" I suggested from my seat beside him. \\\"No, sir,\\\" he confessed. \\\"But I give it to 'em back in English,\\\" he added, joyously. He rather liked these encounters, apparently, but not the beds of sharp, broken stone with which the road was repaired. It was his belief that there was not a steam-roller in all Italy, and he seemed to reserve an opinion of the government's motives in the matter with respect to motors, as if he thought them bad. The scenery of the Campagna was not varied. Once we came to a battlemented tomb, of mighty girth and height, as perdurable in its masonry as the naked, stony hills that in the distance propped the mountains fainting along the horizon under their burden of snow. But as we drew nearer Tivoli the hills drew nearer us, and now they were no longer naked, but densely covered with the gray, interminable stretch of the olive forests. The olive is the tree which, of all others, is the friend of civilized man; it is older and kinder even than the apple, which is its next rival in beneficence; but these two kinds are so like each other, in the mass, that this boundless forest of olives around Tivoli offered an image of all the aggregated apple-orchards in the world. Where the trees came closest to the road they seemed to watch our passing, each with its trunk aslant and its branches akimbo, in a humorous make-believe of being in some joke with us, like so many gnarled and twisted apple-trees, used to children's play-fellowship. You felt a racial intimacy with the whimsical and antic shapes which your brief personal consciousness denied in vain; and you rose among the slopes around Tivoli with a sense of home-coming from the desert of the Campagna. But in the distance to which the olive forests stretched they lost this effect of tricksy familiarity. They looked like a gray sea against the horizon; more fantastically yet, they seemed a vast hoar silence, full of mystery and loneliness. If Tivoli does not flourish so frankly on its oil as Frascati on its wine, it is perhaps because it has of late years tacitly prospered as much on the electricity which its wonderful and beautiful waterfalls enable it to furnish as abundantly to Rome as our own Niagara to Buffalo. The scrupulous Hare, whose Walks in Rome include Tivoli, does not, indeed, advise you to visit the electrical works, but he says that if you have not strength enough for all the interests and attractions of Tivoli it will be wise to give yourself entirely to the cascades and to the Villa d'Este, and this was what we instinctively did, but in the reverse order. Chance rewarded us before we left the villa with a sight of the electric plant, which just below the villa walls smokes industriously away with a round, redbrick chimney almost as lofty and as ugly as some chimney in America. On our way to and fro we necessarily passed through the town, which, with its widish but not straightish chief street, I found as clean as Rome itself, and looking, after the long tumult of its history, beginning well back in fable, as peaceable as Montclair, New Jersey. It had its charm, and, if I could have spent two weeks there instead of two hours, I might impart its effect in much more circumstance than I can now promise the reader. Most of my little time I gladly gave to the villa, which, with the manifold classic associations of the region, attracts the stranger and helps the cataracts sum up all that most people can keep of Tivoli. \\nThe Villa d'Este is not yet a ruin, but it is ruinous enough to win the fancy without cumbering it with the mere rubbish of decay. Some neglected pleasances are so far gone that you cannot wish to live in them, but the forgottenness of the Villa d'Este hospitably allured me to instant and permanent occupation, so that when I heard it could now be bought, casino and all, for thirty thousand dollars, nothing but the want of the money kept me from making the purchase. I indeed recognized certain difficulties in living there the year round; but who lives anywhere the year round if he can help it? The casino, standing among the simpler town buildings on the plateau above the gardens, would be a little inclement, for all its frescoing and stuccoing by the sixteenth-century arts, and in its noble halls, amid the painted and modelled figures, the new American proprietor would shiver with the former host and guests after the first autumn chill began; but while it was yet summer it Avould be as delicious there as in the aisles and avenues of the garden which its balustrated terrace looked into. From that level you descend by marble steps which must have some trouble in knowing themselves from the cascades pouring down the broken steeps beside them, and companionably sharing their seclusion among the cypresses and ilexes. You are never out of the sight and sound of the plunging water, which is still trained in falls and fountains, or left to a pathetic dribble through the tattered stucco of the neglected grots. It is now a good three centuries and a half since the Cardinal Ippolito d'.Este had these gardens laid out and his pleasure-house built overlooking them; and his gardener did not plan so substantially as his architect. In fact, you might suppose that the landscapist wrought with an eye to the loveliness of the ruin it all would soon fall into, and, where he used stone, used it fragilely, so that it would ultimately suggest old frayed and broken lace. Clearly he meant some of the cataracts to face one another, and to have a centre from which they could all be seen - say the still, dull-green basin which occupies a large space in the grounds between them. But he must have meant this for a surprise to the spectator, who easily misses it under the trees overleaning the moss-grown walks which hardly kept themselves from running wild. There is a sense of crumbling decorations of statues, broken in their rococo caverns; of cypresses carelessly grouped and fallen out of their proper straightness and slimness; of unkempt bushes crowding the space beneath; of fragmentary gods or giants half hid in the tangling grasses. It all has the air of something impatiently done for eager luxury, and its greatest charm is such as might have been expected to be won from eventual waste and wreck. If there was design in the treatment of the propitious ground, self-shaped to an irregular amphitheatre, it is now obscured, and the cultiavted tourist of our day may reasonably please himself with the belief that he is having a better time there than the academic Roman of the sixteenth century. Academic it all is, however hastily and nonchalantly, and I feel that I have so signally failed to make the charm of the villa felt that I am going to let a far politer observer celebrate the beauties of the other supreme interest of Tivoli. When Mr. Gray (as the poet loved to be called in print) visited the town with Mr. Walpole in May, 1740, the Villa d'Este by no means shared the honors of the cataracts, and Mr. Gray seems not to have thought it worth seriously describing in his letter to Mr. West, but mocks the casino with a playful mention before proceeding to speak fully, if still playfully, of the great attraction of Tivoli: \\\"Dame Nature... has built here three or four little mountains and laid them out in an irregular semicircle; from certain others behind, at a greater distance, she has drawn a canal into which she has put a little river of hers called the Anio,... which she has no sooner done, but, like a heedless chit, it tumbles down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular, breaks itself all to shatters, and is converted into a shower of rain, where the sun forms many a bow - red, green, blue, and yellow.... By this time it has divided itself, being crossed and opposed by the rocks, into four several streams, each of which, in emulation of the greater one, will tumble down, too: and it does tumble down, but not from an equally elevated place; so that you have at one view all these cascades intermixed with groves of olive and little woods, the mountains rising behind them, and on the top of one (that which forms the extremity of the half-circle's horns) is seated the town itself. At the very extremity of that extremity, on the brink of the precipice, stands the Sibyls' Temple, the remains of a little rotunda, surrounded with its portico, above half of whose beautiful Corinthian pillars are still standing and entire.\\\" For the reader who has been on the spot the poet's words will paint a vivid picture of the scene; for the reader who has not been there, so much the worse; he should lose no time in going, and drinking a cup of the local wine at a table of the restaurant now in possession of Mr. Gray's point of view. I do not know a more filling moment, exclusive of the wine, than he can enjoy there, with those cascades before him and those temples beside him; for Mr. Gray has mentioned only one of the two, I do not know why, that exist on this enchanted spot, and that define their sharp, black shadows as with an inky line just beyond the restaurant tables. One is round and the other oblong, and the round one has been called the Sibyls', though now it is getting itself called Vesta's - the goddess who long unrightfully claimed the temple of Mater Matuta in the Forum Boarium at Rome. As Vesta has lately been dispossessed there by archaeology (which seems in Rome to enjoy the plenary powers of our Boards of Health), she may have been given the Sibyls' Temple at Tivoli in compensation; but all this does not really matter. What really matters is the mighty chasm which yawns away almost from your feet, where you sit, and the cataracts, from their brinks, high or low, plunging into it, and the wavering columns of mist weakly striving upward out of it: the whole hacked by those mountains Mr. Gray mentions, with belts of olive orchard on their flanks, and wild paths furrowing and wrinkling their stern faces. To your right there is a sheeted cataract falling from the basins of the town laundry, where the toil of the washers melts into music, and their chatter, like that of birds, drifts brokenly across the abyss to you. While you sit musing or murmuring in your rapture, two mandolins and a guitar smilingly intrude, and after a prelude of Italian airs swing into strains which presently, through your revery, you recognize as \\\"In the Bowery\\\" and \\\"Just One Girl,\\\" and the smile of the two mandolins and the guitar spreads to a grin of sympathy, and you are no longer at the Cafe Sibylla in Tivoli, but in your own Manhattan on some fairy roof-garden, or at some sixty-cent table d'hote, with wine and music included. It was a fortnight later that we paid our visit to Frascati, not proudly motoring now, but traversing the Campagna on the roof of a populous tram-car, which in its lofty narrowness was of the likeness of an old-fashionable lake propeller. The morning was, like most other mornings in Rome, of an amiability which the afternoons often failed of; but none of us passengers for Frascati doubted its promise as we gathered at the tram-station and tried for tickets at the little booth in a wall sparely containing the official who bade us get them in the car. We all did this, whatever our nation - American, English, German, or Italian - and then we mounted to the hurricane-deck of our propeller and entered into a generous rivalry for the best seats. We had a roof over our heads, and there were curtains which we might have drawn if we could have borne to lose a single glimpse of the landscape, or if we would not rather have suffered the chill which our swift progress evoked from the morning's warmth after we left the shelter of the city streets. We passed through stretches of the ancient aqueducts consorting on familiar terms with rows of shabby tenement-houses, and whisked by the ends of wide, dusty avenues of yet incomplete structure, and by beds of market-gardens, and by simple feeding-places for man and beast, with the tables set close in front of the stalls. An ambitiously frescoed casino had a gigantic peacock painted over a whole story, and the peach-trees were in bloom in the villa spaces. When we struck into the Campagna we found it of like physiognomy with the Campagna toward Tivoli. There was very little tillage, but wide stretches of grazing-land, with those lumps of turfed or naked antiquity starting out of them, and cattle, sheep, and horses feeding over them, the colts' tails blowing picturesquely in the wind that seemed more and more opposed to our advance. It dropped, at times, where we paused to leave a passenger near one of those suburbs which the tram-lines are building up round Rome, but on our course building so slowly that our passengers had to walk rather far from the stations before they reached home. There were other pedestrians who looked rather English, especially some ladies making for the gate of a kind, sunny walled old villa, where there was a girl singing and a gardener coming slowly down to let them in. Nearer Frascati were many neat, new stone houses, where Eoman families come out to stay the spring and fall seasons, and even the summer. But these looked too freshly like the suburban cottages on a Boston trolley-line; and we perversely found our delight in a fine breadth of brown woods for the very reason of that homelikeness which gave us pause in the houses. The trees looked American; there were American wood-roads penetrating the forest's broken and irregular extent; there was one steep-sided ravine worth any man's American money; and the dead leaves littered the sylvan paths with an allure to the foot which it was hard for the head to resist. Elsewhere the tram-line that curved upward to Fras-cati was flanked, after it left the Campagna's level, with vineyards as measureless as the olive orchards of Tivoli. There was yet, at the end of March, no sign of leaf on the newly trimmed vines, which were trained on long poles of canes brought together in peaks to support them and netting the hill-slopes with the endless succession of their tops. The eye wearied itself in following them as in following the checkered wiring of the Kentish hop-fields, and was glad to leave them for the closer-set, but never too closely set, palaces of Frascati: the sort of palaces which we call cottages in our summer cities, and the Italians call casinos from the same instinctive modesty. When we began to doubt of our destination, our car passed a long, shaded promenade, and then stopped in a cheerful square amidst hotels and restaurants, with tables hospitably spread on the sidewalks before them. We decided not to lunch at that early hour, but we could not keep our eyes from feasting, even at eleven o'clock in the morning, on the wonderful prospect that tempted them, on every hand, away from the more immediate affair of choosing one out of the many cabs that thronged about our arriving train. The cabs of Frascati are all finer than the cabs of Rome, and the horses are handsomer and younger and stronger; we could have taken the worst of the equipages that contested our favor and still fared well; but we chose the best - a glittering victoria and an animal of proud action, with a lustrous coat of bay. He wore a ring of joyous bells; he had, indeed, not a headstall of such gay colors as some others; but you cannot have everything, and his driver was of a mental vividness which compensated for all the color wanting in his horse's headstall, and of a personal attraction which made us ambitious for his company on any terms. He quickly reduced us from our vain supposition that carriages in a country-place should be cheaper than in a city; because, as he proved, there were fewer strangers to hire them and they ought logically to be dearer. So far from accepting our modest standards of time and money, he all but persuaded us to employ him for the whole day instead of a few hours at a price beyond our imagination; and he only consented to compromise on a half-day at an increased figure. We supposed that it was the negotiation which drew and held the attention of all the leisure of Frascati, and that it was the driver and our relation to him rather than the horse and our relation to it that concentrated the public interest in us; and when we had convinced him that we had no wish but to see some of the more immediate and memorable villas, we mounted to our places in the victoria and drove out through the reluctantly parting spectators, who remained looking after us as if unable to disperse to their business or pleasure. \\nOur driver decided for us to go first to the Villa Falconieri, which had lately been bought and presented by a fond subject to the German Emperor, and by him in turn bestowed on the German Academy at Rome. In the cold, clean, stony streets of Frascati, as we rattled through them, there breathed the odor of the great local industry; and the doorways of many buildings, widening almost in a circle to admit the burly tuns of wine, testified how generally, how almost universally, the vintage of that measureless acreage of grapes around the place employed the inhabitants. But there was little else to impress the observer in Frascati, and we willingly passed out of the town in the road climbing the long incline to the Villa Falconieri, with its glimpses, far and near, of woods and gardens. It was a road so much to our minds that nothing was further from us than the notion that our horse might not like it so well; but, at the first distinct rise, he stopped and wheeled round so abruptly, after first pawing the air, that there could be no doubt where the popular interest we had lately enjoyed in Frascati had really originated. Probably our horse's distinguishing trait was known to everybody in Frascati except his driver. He, at least, showed the greatest surprise at the horse's behavior, as unprecedented in their acquaintance, which he owned was brief, for he had bought him in Rome only the week before. With successive retreats to level ground he put him again and again at the incline, but as soon as the horse felt the ground rising under his feet he lifted them from it and whirled round for another retreat. All this we witnessed from an advantageous point at the roadside which we had taken up at his first show of reluctance; and at last the driver suggested that we should leave it and go on to the Villa Falconieri on foot. On our part, we suggested that he should attempt some other villa which would not involve an objectionable climb. He then proposed the Villa Mandragone, and the horse seemed to agree with us. As we drove again through the clean, cold, stony streets, with the rounded doorways for the wine-casks, we fancied something clearly ironical in the general interest renewed by our return. But we tried to look as if we had merely done the Villa Falconieri with unexampled rapidity, and pushed on to the Villa Mandragone, where, under the roof of interlacing ilex toughs, our horse ought to have been tempted on in a luxurious unconsciousness of anything like an incline. But he was apparently an animal which would have felt the difference between two rose-leaves and one in a flowery path, and just when we were thinking what a delightful time we were having, and beginning to feel a gentle question as to who the pathetic little cripple halting toward us with a color-box and a camp-stool might be, and whether she painted as well as a kind heart could wish, our horse stopped with the suddenness which we knew to be definite. The sensitive creature could not be deceived; he must have reached rising ground, and we sided with him against our driver, who would have pretended it was fancy. It was now noon, and we drove back to the piazza, agreeing upon a less price in view of the imperfect service rendered, and deciding to collect our thoughts for a new venture over such luncheon as the best hotel could give us. It was not so good a hotel as the lunch it gave. It was beyond the cleansing tide of modernity which has swept the Roman hotels, and was dirty everywhere, but with a specially dirty, large, shabby dining-room, cold and draughty, yet precious for the large, round brazier near our table which kept one side of us warm in romantic mediaeval fashion, and invited us to rise from time to time and thaw our fingers over its blinking coals. The bath in which our chicken had been boiled formed a good soup; there was an admirable pasta and a creditable, if imperfect, conception of beefsteak; and there was a caraffe of new Frascati wine, sweet, like new cider. If we could have asked more, it would not have been more than the young Italian officer who sat in the other corner with his pretty young wife, and who allowed me to weave a whole realistic fiction out of their being at Frascati so out of season. Just as I was most satisfyingly accounting for them, our late driver alarmed me by appearing at the door and beckoning me to the outside. The occasion was nothing worse than the presence of a man who, he said, was his brother, with a horse which, upon the same authority, was without moral blame or physical blemish. If anything, it preferred a mountain to a plain country, and could be warranted to balk at nothing. The man, who was almost as exemplary as the horse, would assume the unfulfilled contract of the other man and horse with a slight increase of pay; and yet I had my doubts. The day had clouded, and I meekly contended that it was going to rain; but the man explicitly and the horse tacitly scoffed at the notion, and I yielded. I shall always be glad that I did so, for in the keeping of those good creatures the rest of our day was an unalloyed delight. It appeared, upon further acquaintance, that the man paid a hundred dollars for the horse; his brother had paid a hundred and twenty-five for the balker; but it was the belief of our driver that it would be worth the difference when it had reconciled itself to the rising ground of Frascati; as yet it was truly a stranger there. His own horse was used to ups and downs everywhere; they had just come from a long trip, and he was going to drive to Siena and back the next week with two ladies for passengers, who were to pay him five dollars a day for himself and horse and their joint keep. He said the ladies, whose names he gave, were from Boston; he balked at adding Massachusetts, but I am sure the horse would not; and, if I could have hired them both to carry me about Italy indefinitely, I would have gladly paid them five dollars a day as long as I had the money. The fact is, that driver was charming, a man of sense and intelligence, who reflected credit even upon his brother and his brother's horse: one of those perfect Italian temperaments which endear their possessors to the head and heart, so that you wonder, at parting, how you are going to live without them. We did not excite such vivid interest in Frascati at our second start as at our first; but, as we necessarily passed over the same route again, we had the applause of the children in streets now growing familiar, and a glad welcome back from the pretty girls and blithe matrons of all ages rhythmically washing in the public laundry, who recognized us in our new equipage. The public laundry is always the gayest scene in an Italian town, and probably our adventures continued the subject of joyous comment throughout the day which was now passing only too rapidly for us. We were again on the way to the Villa Falconieri, and while our brave horse is valiantly mounting the steep to its gate this is perhaps as good a place as any to own that the Villa Falconieri and the Villa Man-dragone were the only sights we saw in Frascati. We did, indeed, penetrate the chill interior of the local cathedral, but as we did not know at the time that we were sharing it with the memory of the young Stuart pretender Charles Edward, who died in Frascati, and whose brother, Cardinal York, placed a mural tablet to him in the church, we were conscious of no special claim upon our interest. We ought, of course, to have visited the Villa Aldobrandini and the Villa Ruffinella and the Villa Graziola and the Villa Taverna, but we left all these to the reader, who will want some reason for going to Frascati in person, and to whom I commend them as richly worth crossing the Atlantic for. Doubtless from a like motive we left the ruins of Tusculum unvisited, just as at Tivoli we refrained from diverging to Hadrian's Villa - the two things supremely worthy to be seen in their respective regions. But, if I had seen only half as much as I saw at Frascati - the Villa Falconieri, namely - I should feel forever over-enriched by the experience. Slowly an ancient servitor, whose family had been in the employ of the Falconieri for a century, advanced as with the burden of their united years and opened the high gate to us and delivered us over to a mild boy. He bestowed on us, for a consideration, a bunch of wild violets, and then, as if to keep us from the too abrupt sight of the repairs and changes going on near the casino, led us first to the fish-pond, in the untouched seclusion of a wooded hill, and silently showed us the magnificent view which the top commanded, if commanded is not too proud a word for a place so pathetic in its endearing neglect. It had once been the haunt of many a gay picnicking crew in hoops and bag-wigs and all the faded fashion of the past, when hosts and guests had planned a wilder escapade than the grove before the casino invited, with its tables of moss-painted marble. There would have been an academic poet, or more than one, in the company, and they would have furnished forth the prospect with phrases far finer than any I have about me, who can only say that the Cam-pagna, clothed in mist and cloud-shadowed, swam round the upland in the colors of a tropic sea. \\nOur mild boy waited a decent moment, as if to let me do better, and then led down to the casino, round through a wooded valley where there were some men with fowling-pieces, whom I objected to in tones, if not in terms. \\\"What are they shooting?\\\" \\\"They are shooting larks, signore.\\\" \\\"What a pity!\\\" \\\"But the larks are leaving Italy, now, and going north.\\\" It was a reason, like many another that humanity is put to it in giving, and I do not know that I missed any larks, later, from an English meadow where I saw them spiring up in song, and glad as if none of their friends had been shot at the Villa Falconieri. In fact, I did not see those fowlers actually killing any; and I can still hope they were not very good shots. The workmen who were putting the place in repair were lunching near the casino, in a litter of lumber and other structural material, but the casino itself seemed as yet unprofaned by their touch. At any rate, we had it quite to ourselves, let wander at will through its cool, bare, still spaces. If there was a great deal to see, there was not much to remember, or to remember so much as the satirical frescos of Pier Leone Ghezzi, who has caricatured himself as well as others in them. They are not bitter satires, but, on the contrary, very charming; and still more charming are the family portraits frescoed round the principal room. Under one curve of the vaulted ceiling the whole family of a given time is shown, half-length but life-size, looking down pleasantly on the unexpected American guests who try to pretend they were invited, or at least came by mistaking the house for another. Better even than this most amiable circle, or half-circle, of father, mother, and daughter are the figures of friends or acquaintances or kinsfolk: figures not only life-size, but full-length, in panels of the walls, in the very act of stepping on the floor and coming forward to greet their host and hostess from the other walls. They did not visibly move during our stay, but I know they only waited for us to go; and that at night, especially when there was a moon, or none, they left their backgrounds and mingled in the polite gayeties of their period. One could hardly help looking over one's shoulder to see if they were not following to that farthermost room called Primavera, which is painted around and aloft like a very bower of spring, with foliage and flowers covering the walls and dropping through the trellis feigned overhead. Of all the caprices of art, which in Italy so loved caprice, I recall no such pleasing playfulness as in the decoration of these rooms. If you pass through the last you may look from the spring within on no fairer spring without bordering the shores of the Campagna sea. It was so pathetic to imagine the place going out of the right Italian keeping that I attributed a responsive sadness to the tall, handsome, elderly woman who had allowed us the freedom of the casino. Her faded beauty was a little sallow, as the faded beauty of a Roman matron should be, and her large, dark eyes glowed from purpling shadows. \\\"And the German Emperor owns it now?\\\" \\\"Yes, they say he has bought it.\\\" \\\"And the Germans will soon be coming?\\\" \\\"They say.\\\" She would not commit herself but by a tone, an inflection, but we knew very well what she and the frescoed presences about us thought. I wish now I could have stayed behind and got the frescos to tell me just how far I ought recognize her sorrow in my tip, but one must always guess at these things, and I shall never know whether I rewarded the aged gatekeeper according to the century of service his generations had rendered those of the frescos. We were going now to the Villa Mandragone, but we had not yet the courage for the rise of ground where we had failed before, and we entreated our driver to go round some other way, if he could, and descend rather than ascend to it. He said that was easy, and it was when we came away that we passed through that ilex avenue which we had not yet penetrated in its whole length, and where we now met many foot-passengers, lay and cleric, who added to the character of the scene, and saw again the little cripple artist, now trying to seize its features, or some of them. I did not see whether she was succeeding so well as in pity she might and as I knew she did. In spite of our triumph with the Villa Mandragone in this second attempt, we can never think it half as charming as the Villa Falconieri. I forget what cardinal it was who built it so spacious and splendid, with three hundred and sixty-five windows, in honor of the calendar as reformed by the reigning pope, Gregory XIII. It is a palace enclosing a quadrangle of whole acres (I will not own to less), with a stately colonnade following as far round as the reader likes. When he passes through all this magnificence he will come out on a grassy terrace, with a fountain below it, and below that again the chromatic ocean of the Cam-pagna (I have said sea often enough). A weird sort of barbaric stateliness is given to the place by the twisted and tapering pillars that rise at the several corners, with colossal masques carven at the top and the sky showing through the eye-hollows, as the flame of torches must often have shown at night. But for all the outlandish suggestion of these pillars, the villa now belongs to the Jesuits, who have a college there, where only the sons of noble families are received for education. As we rounded a sunny wall in driving away, we saw a line of people, old and young of both sexes, but probably not of noble families, seated with their backs against the warm stone eating from comfortable bowls a soup which our driver said was the soup of charity and the daily dole of the fathers to such hungry as came for it. The day was now growing colder than it had been, and we felt that the poor needed all the soup, and hot, that they could get. After a vain visit to Grotta Ferrata, which was signally disappointing, in spite of the traces of a recent country fair and the historical merits of a church of the Greek rite, with a black-bearded monk coming to show it through a gardened cloister, we were glad to take the tram back to Rome and to get into the snug inside of it. The roof, which had been so popular and populous in the morning, was now so little envied that a fat lady descended from it and wedged herself into a row of the interior where a sylph would have fitted better but might not have added so much to the warmth. No one, myself of the number, thought of getting up, though there were plenty of straps to hang by if one had chosen to stand. This was quite like home, and so was it like home to have the conductor ask me to wait for my change, with all the ensuing fears that wronged the long-delayed remembrance of his debt. In some things it appears that at Rome the Romans do as the Americans do, but I wish we were like them in having such a place as Frascati within easy tram-reach of our cities. \\n\\nXV. A FEW REMAINING MOMENTS \\nIn the days of the earlier sixties, we youth who wished to be thought elect did not feel ourselves so unless we were deeply read in Hawthorne's romance of The Marble Faun. We made that our aesthetic handbook in Rome, and we devoutly looked up all the places mentioned in it, which were important for being mentioned; though such places as the Tarpeian Rock, the Forum, the Capitoline Museum, and the Villa Bor-ghese might secondarily have their historical or artistic interest. In like manner Story's statue of Cleopatra was to be seen, because it was the \\\"original\\\" of the imaginary sculptor Kenyon's Cleopatra, and a certain mediaeval tower was sacred because it was universally identified as the tower where the heroine Hilda lived dreaming and drawing, and fed the doves that circled around its top. We used to show the new arrivals where Hilda's tower was, and then stand with them watching the pigeons which made it unmistakable. I should then have thought I could never forget it, but I must have passed it several times unnoting in my latest Roman sojourn, when one afternoon in a pilgrimage to the Via del Gambero a contemporary of that earlier day glanced around the narrow piazza through which we were passing and, seeing a cloud of doves wheeling aloft, joyfully shouted, \\\"Look! There is Hilda's tower!\\\" and if Hilda herself had waved to us from its battlements we could not have been surer of it. The present vanished, and we were restored to our citizenship in that Rome of the imagination which is greater than any material Rome, and which it needs no archaeologist to discover in its indestructible integrity. No one to-day, probably, visits the Capitoline Museum for the Faun of Praxiteles because it gave the romance its name; but at my latest sight of it I remembered it with a thrill of the young piety which first drew me to it, and involuntarily I looked again for the pointed, furry ears, as I had done of old, to make sure that it was really the Marble Faun of Hawthorne. I was now, however, for no merit of mine, in official and scientific company with which it would have been idle to share my satisfaction in the verification of the Faun's ears. Instead of boasting it, I listened to very interesting talk of the deathless Dying Gladiator, who is held to have been originally looked at more from below than he has been seen in modern times, and who is presently to be lifted to something like his antique level. He, in fact, requires this from the spectator who would feel all his pathos, as we realized in sitting down and looking a little upward at him. \\nIn his room and in the succession of the rooms filled with his immortal bronze and marble companions I was as if with ghosts of people I had known in some anterior life. They were so familiar that I felt no need to go about asking their names, even if the archaeologists had in several cases given them new names. I should have known certain of them by traits which remain in the memory long after names have dropped out of it. Julius Caesar, with his long Celtic upper-lip, still looked like the finer sort of Irish-American politician; Tiberius again surprised me with the sort of racial sanity and beauty surviving in his atrocious personality from his mother's blood; but the too Neronian head of Nero, which seems to have been studied from the wild young miscreant when trying to look the part, had an unremembered effect of chubby idiocy. A thing that freshly struck me in the busts of those imperialities, which of course must have been done in their lifetimes, was not merely that the subjects were mostly so ugly and evil but that the artists were apparently safe in showing them so. The men might not have minded that, but how had the sculptors managed to portray the women as they did and live? Perhaps they did not live, or live long; they are a forgotten tribe, and no one can say what became of any given artist after executing the bust of an empress; his own execution may have immediately followed. But what is certain is that those ladies are no lovelier in their looks than they were in their lives; to be sure, in their rank they had not so great need of personal charm as women of the lower class. The most touching face as well as the most dignified and beautiful face among them is that of the seated figure which used to be known as that of Agrippina but which, known now as that of a Roman matron, does not relieve the imperial average of plainness. The rest could rival the average American society woman only in the prevailing modernity of their expression; imperial Rome was very modern, as we all know, and nothing in our own time could be more up to date than the lives and looks of its smart people. The general impression of the other marbles of the Capitoline Museum remains a composite of standing, sitting, stooping, and leaning figures, of urns and vases, of sarcophaguses and bas-reliefs. If you can be definite about some such delightful presence as that old River dozing over his fountain in the little cold court you see first and last as you come and go, it is more than your reader, if he is as wise as you wish him, can ask of you. I have been wondering whether he could profitably ask of me some record of my experiences in the official and scientific company with which I was honored that day at the Campidoglio; but I should have to offer him again a sort of composite psychograph of objects printed one upon another and hardly separable in their succession. There would be the figure of Marcus Aurelius, commanding us with outstretched arm from the back of the bronze charger which would not obey Michelangelo when he bade it \\\"Go,\\\" not because it was not lifelike, but because it was too fat to move. Against the afternoon sky, looking down into the piazza with dreamy unconcern from their vantage would be the statues on the balustrated roof of the museum. There would be the sense, rather than the vision, of the white shoulders of Castor and Pollux beside their steeds above the dark-green garden spaces on either hand; there would be the front of the Church of Ara Coeli visible beyond the insignificance of Rienzi's monument; and filling in the other end of the piazza which Michelangelo imagined, and not the Romans knew, there would be the palace of the senator, to which the mayor and the common council of modern Rome now mount by a double stairway, and presumably meet at the top in proceeding to their municipal labors. Facing the museum would be the palace of the Conservatori, where in the noblest of its splendid halls the present company would find itself in the carved and gilded arm-chairs of the conservators, seated at an afternoon tea-table and restoring itself from the fatigues of more and more antique art in the galleries about. After this there would be the gardened court of the palace, with a thin lawn, and a soft little fountain musing in the midst of it, and the sunset light lifting on the wall where the fragments of Septimius Severus's marble map of Rome order themselves in such coherence as archaeology can suggest for them. In the palace of the Senator (who was not, as I dare say the reader ignorantly supposes, a residuum of the old Roman senate, but was the dictator whom the mediaeval republic summoned from within or without to be its head and its safeguard from the aristocracy) there would be, beyond the chamber where the actual city council of Rome meets under the presidency of the mayor, the great public rooms bannered and memorialled around with heroic and historic blazons; and last there would be the private room where the syndic devotes himself to civic affairs when he can turn from the sight of the Roman Forum, with a peripatetic archaeologist lecturing a group of earnest Americans, while long, velvety shadows of imperial purple stretch from the sunset on the softly rounded and hollowed ruins of the Palatine. But, if each of these bare facts could be parted from the others and intelligently presented, what would it avail with the reader who has never seen the originals of my psychograph? It is from some such question, and not from want of a hospitable will, that I hesitate to ask him to go with me on a golden morning of March and spend it in the Villa Medici on the Pincian Hill. If I could I should like to pour its yellowness and mellowness round him, perfumed with a potpourri of associations from the time of Lucullus down through every mediaeval and modern time to that very day, when I knew Carolus Duran to be living somewhere in these beauteous bounds as the head of the French Academy which has its home in them. The academic garden-paths, with a few happy people wandering between their correctly balanced passages of box; the blond facade of the casino looking down with its statues and reliefs on these parterres; a young girl vanishing up an aisle of the grove beside the garden into whatever dream awaited her youth in the leafy dusk; an old American pair gazing after her from the terrace, with the void of the vanished years aching in their hearts for the Rome that was once young with them: does this represent to the reader an appreciable morning in the Villa Medici? He may be grateful to me if he does, and if he likes. I cannot do more for him without doing less, and yet I know it is a palette rather than a picture I am giving him. \\nAll the while I was there, the guest of the French nation by the payment of fifty centimes gate-money, I was obscurely resenting its retention of a place which Bonaparte bestowed upon the First Republic with so much other loot from Italy. But now I have lately heard that the magnanimous Third Republic is going to restore it to the people rightfully its owners, and the remembrance of my morning in the Villa Medici will remain a pure joy. So few joys in this world, even in the very capital of it, are without some touch of abatement. I could not so much as visit the Catacombs of Domatilla without suffering a frustration which, though incidental merely, left a lasting pang of unrequited interest. As we drew toward the place, I saw in a field the beginning of one of those domestic dramas which are not attributable to Italy alone. Three peasants, a man and two women, were engaged in controversy which, on his side, the man supported with both hands flapping wildly at the heads of the women, who alertly dodged and circled around him in the endeavor to close in upon him. It was instantly conjecturable, if not apparent, that they were his wife and daughter, and that he was the worse for the vintage of their home acre, and would be the better for being got into the house and into bed. The conjecture enlisted the worthier instincts of the witness on the side of the mother and daughter; but he was in no hurry to have the animated action brought to a close, and was about to tell his cabman to drive very, very slowly, when suddenly the cab descended into a valley, and when the eager spectator rose to his former level again the stone wall had risen with him, and he never knew the end of that passage of real life. It was impossible to bid the cabman drive back for the close of the scene; the abrupt conclusion must be accepted as final; but it is proof of the charm I found in the gentle guide who presently began to marshal us among the paths of the subterranean sanctuary and cemetery that for the moment my bitter sense of loss was assuaged, and it only returns now at long intervals. Such as the woman actors in this brief scene were some early Christians might have been, and it must have been the stubborn old pagan spirit I saw surviving in the husband and father. He was probably such a vessel of wrath as, being filled with Bacchus, would have lent itself to the persecuting rage of Domitian and helped drive the emperor's gentle cousin Domatilla into the exile whence she returned to found a Christian cemetery in her villa. One understands, of course, under the villa; for the catacombs in some places reach as many as five levels below the surface. I will not follow the reader with that kind guide who will cheer his wanderings through those sunless corridors of death, where many of the sleepers still lie sealed within their tombs on either hand, and show him by the smoky taper's light the frescos which adorn the cramped chapels. I prefer to stand at the top of the entrance and ask him if he noticed how the artist sometimes seemed not to know whether he was pagan or Christian, and did not mind, for instance, putting a Mercury at the heads of the horses in an Ascent of Elijah. Perhaps the artist was really a pagan and thought a Greek god as good as a Hebrew prophet any day; art was probably one of the last things to be converted, having a presentiment of the dark and bloody themes the new religion would give it to deal with. The earthy scent of the catacomb will cling to the reader's clothes, and he will have two minds about keeping for a souvenir the taper which he carried, and which the guide wraps in a bit of newspaper for him; he may prefer the flower which he is allowed to gather from the tiny garden at the entrance to the catacombs. Yet these Catacombs of Domatilla are among the cheerfulest of all the catacombs, and a sense of something sweet and appealing invests them from the memory of the gentle lady whose piety consecrated them as the last home of the refugees and martyrs. They are of the more recent Roman excavations, but I do not know whether later or earlier than those which have revealed the house of the two Christian gentlemen, John and Paul, of unknown surname, where they suffered death for their faith, under the Passionist church named for them. Twenty-four rooms on the two stories have been opened, and there are others yet to be opened; when all are laid bare they will perfectly show what a Roman city dwelling of the better sort was like in the mid-imperial time. The plan differs from that of the average Pompeian house as much as the plan of a cross-town New York dwelling would differ from that of the average Newport cottage. The rooms are incomparably smaller than those of the mediaeval palaces of the Roman nobles, and the decoration is sometimes crudely mixed of pagan and Christian themes and motives; the artists, like the painters of the Domatilla catacombs, were probably lingering in the old Greek tradition. The young Passionist father who showed us through the church and the house under it made us wait half an hour while he finished his lunch, but he was worth waiting for. He was a charming enthusiast for both, radiantly yet reverently exulting in their respective treasures, and justly but not haughtily proud of the newly introduced electricity which lighted the darkness of the underground rooms and corridors. He told us he had been twenty years a missionary in Rumania, where he had possibly acquired the delightful English he spoke. When he would have us follow him he said, \\\"All persons come this way,\\\" and he politely spoke of the wicked emperor whose bust was somehow there as Mr. Commodus. With all his gentleness, however, that good father had a certain smiling severity before which the spirit bowed. He had made us wait half an hour before he came to let us into the church, and during the hour we were with him there he kept the door locked against an unlucky lady who arrived just too late to enter with us. Not only this, but he utterly refused to go back with her singly and show her the things we had seen. Perhaps it would not have been decorous; they do not let ladies, either singly or plurally, into the garden of the convent, which is memorable among many other facts as being the retreat of Mr. Commodus when he suffered from sleeplessness, and where he once carelessly left his list of victims lying about, so that his friend Marcia found it and, reading her name in it, joined with other friends in his assassination. The sex has indeed had much restraint to bear from the Church, but in some respects it has been rendered fearless in the assertion of its rights. With poor women one of these is the indefeasible right to ask alms, and I admired the courage, almost the ferocity, of the aged crone whom I had promised charity in coming to the place and who rose up as I was being driven past her, in going away, and stayed my cabman with a clamor which he dared not ignore. Her reproaches continued through the ensuing transaction, and followed him away with stings which instinct and experience taught her how to implant in his tenderest sensibilities. A chapter much longer than any I have written here might well be devoted to the study of the clerical or secular guides in the minor churches of Rome. They are of every manner and degree of kindliness, mixed with a fair measure of intelligence and a very fitting faith in the legends of their churches. You soon get on terms of impersonal intimacy with them, and you cannot come away without sharing their professional zeal, and distinguishing for the moment in favor of their respective churches above every other. It did not matter whether it was that newest church in the Quartiere dei Prati, or that most venerable among the oldest churches, the Church of San Gregorio: I found a reason for agreeing with the sacristan upon its singular claims. These were especially enforced by the good dame, the only woman sacristan I remember, who would not spare us a single object of interest in San Gregorio's, which is indeed for the visitor of Anglo-Saxon race supremely rich in its associations with the conversions of his ancestors from heathenism. \\nBeing myself of Cymric blood, and of a Christianity several hundred years older than that of the ordinary Anglo-Saxon traveller, I am afraid that it was from a rather patronizing piety that I visited the church where the great St. Gregory dismissed to their mission in England St. Augustine and his fellow-apostles on one of the greatest days of the sixth century. I might have stayed to imagine them kneeling among the people who then thronged the genially irregular piazza, but as we came up some ecclesiastical students were playing ball there, their robes tucked into their girdles for their greater convenience, and we made our way at once into the church. It forms one of a consecrated group of edifices enshrining the memory of the best of the popes, who was also the greatest; and here or in the adjacent convents a score of miracles were wrought through the heavenly beauty of his life. Of these miracles, of whose inspiration you must feel the poetry even if you cannot feel their verity, the loveliest has its substantial witness in one of the little chapels next the church. There you may see with your eyes and touch with your hands the table at which St. Gregory fed every morning twelve poor men, till one morning a thirteenth appeared in the figure of Christ the Lord, as if to own them His disciples. The chapel which enshrines the table is one of three, quaint in form and rich in art, standing in the garden called St. Silvia's, after the mother of St. Gregory. As we came out through it the westering sun poured the narrow court before the chapel full of golden light and threw the black shadow of a cypress across the way that a file of Comaldolese monks were taking to the adjoining convent. They were talking cheerily together, and swung unheeding by in their white robes so near that I could almost feel the waft of them across the centuries that parted their faith and mine. We had come to St. Gregory's from the Baths of Caracalla, which we had set out to see on the first of our Roman holidays, and, after turning aside for the Coliseum, had now visited on next to the last of them. The stupendous ruin could scarcely have been growing in the ten or twelve weeks that had passed, but a bewildering notion of something like this obsessed me as I saw it bulking aloof in overhanging cliffs and precipices, through the cool and bright April air, against a sky of absolute blue. As if it had been cast up out of the earth in some convulsive throe of nature, it floundered over its vast area in shapeless masses which seemed to have capriciously received the effect of human design in the coping of the inaccessible steeps, in the arches flinging themselves across the spaces between the beetling crags, in the monstrous spring and sweep of the vaults, in the gloom of the cavernous apertures of its Titanic walls. For the moment its immensity dwarfed the image of all the other fragments of the Roman world and set definite bounds to their hugeness in the mind. It seemed to have been not so much a single edifice as a whole city, the dwelling instead of the resort of the multitudes that once thronged it. The traces of the ornamentation which had enriched it everywhere and which it had taken ages of ravage to strip from it, accented its savage majesty, and again the sentiment of spring in the fresh afternoon breeze and sunshine, and the innocent beauty of the blooming peach and cherry in the orchards around, imparted to it a pathos in which one's mere brute wonder was lost. But it was a purely adventitious pathos, and it must be owned here, at the end, that none of the relics of ancient Rome stir a soft emotion in the beholder, and, as for beauty, there is more of it in some ivy-netted fragment of some English abbey which Henry's Cromwell \\\"hammered down\\\" than in the ruin of all the palaces and temples and theatres and circuses and baths of that imperial Rome which the world is so well rid of. \\n\\nVII. A WEEK AT LEGHORN \\nWe left Rome with such a nostalgic pang in our hearts that we tried to find relief in a name for it, and we called ourselves Romesick. Afterward, when we practised the name with such friends as we could get to listen, they thought we said homesick. Being better instructed, they stared or simpered, and said, \\\"Oh!\\\" That was not all we could have asked, but Rome herself would understand, and, while we were seeking this outlet for our grief, she followed us as far as she could on her poor, broken aqueducts. At places they gave way under her, and she fell down, but scrambled up again on the next stretch of arches, like some fond cripple pursuing a friend on crutches; when at last our train outran them, and there was no longer an arch to halt upon, she gave up the vain chase and turned back within her walls, where we saw her domes and bell-towers fading into the heaven to which they pointed. It was a heaven of better than absolute blue, for there were soft, white clouds in it, and the air that our Sunday breathed under it was, at the beginning of April, as bland as that of an American May-end. The orchard trees were in bloom - peach and plum, cherry and pear - whenever you chose to look at them, and all nature seemed to rejoice in the cessation of the two days' strike which had now enabled us to drive to the station instead of walking and carrying our bags and bundles. There were so many of these that we had taken two cabs, and at the station our drivers attempted to rejoice with nature in an overcharge that would have recouped them for the loss suffered in their recent leisure. But as we were then leaving Koine, and were not yet melted with the grief of absence, I had the courage to resist their demand. Long before we reached Leghorn I was so Romesick that I would have paid them anything they asked. When we emerged from the suburbs upon the open Campagna, we passed through many fields of wheat, more than we had yet seen on the grassy waste, but there were also many flocks of sheep feeding with the cattle in pastures. Now and then we passed a wretched hut which seemed to be the dwelling of the shepherds we saw tending the flocks, and here and there we came upon a group of farm buildings, all of straw, whether for man or beast, set within a sort of squalid court, with a frowzy suggestion of old women and children about the doors of the cottages. We saw no men, though there must have been men off at work in the fields with the younger women. As we drew near Civita Vecchia the sea widened on our view, wild with a wind that seemed to have been blowing ever since the stormy evening in 1865 when, after looking at the tossing ships in the harbor, we decided to take the diligence for Leghorn, rather than the little steamer we had meant to take. From our pleasant train we now patronized Civita Vecchia with a recognition of its picturesqueness, unvexed by the choice that then insisted on itself, though the harbor was as full of shipping as of old. There was time to run out for a cup of coffee at the station buffet, where there had been neither station nor buffet in our young time: but doubtless then as now there had been the lonely graveyard outside the town, with its sea-beaten, seaward wall. We buried there the last of our Roman holidays under a sky that had changed from blue to gray since our journey began, and mournfully set out faces northward in the malarial Maremma. If the Maremma is as malarial as it is famed, it does not look it. There were stretches of hopeless morass, with wide acreages under water, but mostly, I should say, it was rather a hilly country. Now and then we ran by a stony old town on a distant summit like the outcropping of granite or marble, and there were frequent breadths of woodland, oak and pine and, I dare say, walnut and chestnut. Evidently there had been efforts to reclaim the Maremma from its evil air and make it safely habitable, and the farther we penetrated it the more frequent the evidences were. There were many new buildings of a good sort, and of wood as well as stone; when we came to Grosetto, where we had spent a memorable night after being overturned in the Ombrone, in the attempt of our diligence to pass its flood, we were aware, in the evening light, of a prosperity which, if not excessive for the twoscore years that had passed, was still very noticeable. I should not quite say that the brick wall of the city had been scraped and scrubbed, but it looked very neat and new, and there was a pleasant suburb under it where the moat might have been, and people were coming and going who had almost the effect of commuters; at least, they seemed to have come out to their homes by trolley. We resisted an impulse to dismount and go up to the inn in the heart of the town where we had spent that \\\"night of memory and of sighs.\\\" But we searched the horizon round for the point on the highway where our diligence had failed of the track between the telegraph-poles and softly rolled with us in the muddy waters, like an elephant taking a bath, but, so far from finding it, we could not even find the highway. We began to have our doubts of what we had always believed had happened, and remained as snugly as we could in our compartment, where, to tell the truth, we were not very snug. In too fond a reliance on the almanac, the Italian government had cut off the steam which ought to have heated it, and the cold from the hills, on which we saw snow, pierced our rugs and cushions; but, if we had known what we were coming to in Leghorn, we should have thought ourselves very enviable. I do not know exactly how far it is from the station in Leghorn to the hotel where we had providently engaged rooms with a fire in at least one of them, but I should say at a rough calculation it was a hundred miles as we covered the distance in a one-horse omnibus, through long, straight streets, after ten o'clock at night. The streets and houses were mostly dark, as houses of good habits should be at that hour, but, after passing through a wide, lonely piazza, we struck into a street longer and straighter than the others, and drew up at our hotel door opposite an hilarious cafe, where there seemed a general rejoicing of some sort. We were unable to make out just what sort, or to join in it without knowing, though it lasted well toward morning, and we were up often during the night to see that the fire did not die out of our one porcelain stove and leave us to perish of cold. In Leghorn the good Baedeker says that all the hotels are good, and this sweeping verdict may be true if taken in the sense that one is as good as another, but they are of the old Italian type which our winter in Rome had taught us to think obsolete; now we found that it was only obsolescent. We had written to bespeak a room with fire in it, and this was well, for the hotel was otherwise heated only by the bodies of its frequenters, who, when filled with Chianti, might emit a sensible warmth; though it was very modern in being lighted with electricity, and having a lift, in which, after a tepid supper, we were carried to our apartment. We had our landlord's company at supper, and had learned from him that the most eminent of American financiers, who shall not otherwise be identified here, was in the habit, when coming to Leghorn, of letting him know that he was bringing a party of friends, and commanding of him a banquet such as he alone knew how to furnish a millionaire of that princely quality. After that we were not so much surprised as grieved to find that our elderly chambermaid had profited by our absence to gather all the coals out of our one stove into two scaldini, which were bristling before her where she knelt when we opened the door upon her. She apologized, but still she carried away the coals, and we were left to rekindle the zeal of our stove as best we could. It was not a large stove, and it seemed to feel its inadequacy to the office of taking the chill off that vast, dim room, where it cowered, dark and low upon the floor, with a yearning, upward stretch of its pipe lost in space before it reached the lowermost goddess in the allegory frescoed on the ceiling. If it had been a white porcelain stove, that might have helped, but it was of a gloomy earthen color that imparted no more cheer than warmth. We rebuilt our fire, after many repeated demands for kindling, which had apparently to be sawed and split in a distant wood-yard before we could get it, and then the long, arctic night set in, unrelieved by the noisy gayeties of the cafe across the way. These burst from time to time the thin film of sleep which formed like a coating of ice over the consciousness, and then one could only get up and put more wood into the despairing stove and more clothes on the beds. Well for us that we had thought to bring all our travelling rugs with us in straps, instead of abandoning them with our other baggage in the station till next day! But, even with these heaping the hotel blankets and com-forters, we shivered, and a superannuated odor that had lurked in the recesses of those rooms, to which the sun or wind had never pierced, grew with the growing cold, and haunted the night like something palpable as well as sensible - the materialization of smells dead and buried there long ago. It was wonderful how little way the electric bulb shed its beams in that naughty air; it would not even light the page which at one time was opened in the vain hope that the author would help the benumbing cold to bring torpor if not slumber to the weary brain. It is really impossible to say where or how we breakfasted, but it was somehow managed, and then search was made by the swiftest conveyance for the hotel which we had heard of outside the city, as helping make Leghorn the watering-place it is for Italians in the summer, and in the winter as being steam-heated and appointed with every modern comfort for the passing or sojourning stranger. It was all that and more, and only for the fear that I should seem to join it in advertising its merits I should like to celebrate it by name. But perhaps it is as well not; if I did, all my readers would swarm upon that hotel, and there would be no room for me, who hope some day to go back there and spend an old age of luxurious leisure. There was not only steam-heat in the public rooms of the ground floor, but there was furnace heat in all the corridors, and there were fireplaces in certain chambers, which also looked out on the sea, to Corsica and Elba and other isles of it, and would be full of sun as soon as the cold rain closed a fortnight's activity. That which diffused a blander atmosphere than steam or radiator, register and hearth, however, was the kind will, the benevolent intelligence, which imagined us, and which would not then let us go. We had become not only agnostic as respected the possibility of warmth in Leghorn, we were open sceptics, aggressive infidels. But the landlord himself followed us from one room to another, lighting fires here and there on the hearth, making us feel the warm air rising from the furnace, calling us to witness by palpation the heat of the radiators, soothing our fears, and coaxing our unfaith. His wife joined him in Italian and his son in English, and, if I do not say that these amiable people were worthy all the prosperity which was not then apparent in their establishment, may I never be comfortably lodged or fed again. Our daily return for what we got was a poor twelve francs each; but fancy a haughty American landlord caressing us with such sweet and reassuring civility for any sum of money! Those gentle people made themselves our friends; there was nothing they would not do, or try to do, for us, in the vast, pink palace where we were never twenty guests together, and mostly eight or ten, with the run of a reading-room where there were the latest papers and periodicals from London and Paris, and with a kitchen whence we were served the best luncheons and dinners we ate in Europe. The place had the true out-of-season charm. There were two stately dining-rooms besides the one where we dined, and there were pleasant spaces where we had afternoon tea or after-dinner coffee, and from which a magnificent stairway ascended to the upper halls, and a quiet lift waited our orders, with the landlord or his son to take us up; and so lonely and quiet and gentle, with porters and chambermaids speaking beautiful Tuscan, and watchful attendants everywhere prophesying and fulfilling our wants. It was a keeping to make the worst believe in their merit, and we were not the worst. Outside, the environment flattered or rewarded us with a garden of laurel and other evergreens, and with flower-beds where the annuals were beginning to show the gardener's designs in their sprouting seeds. Beyond these ample villa bounds a tram-car murmured to and from the well-removed city, and beyond its track lay a line of open-air theatres and variety shows and bathing establishments, as at our own Atlantic City, but here in enduring masonry instead of the provisional wood of our summer architecture. \\nThis festive preparation intimated the watering-place supremacy which Leghorn enjoys in Italy, and which must make our quiet hotel in the season glisten and twitter and flutter with the vivid national life. The preparation includes a delightful drive by the seashore, with groves and gardens, to the city gate and indefinitely beyond it, which we one day followed as far as an old fort, where a little hotel had nestled with every promise of simple comfort. There was a neighboring village of no very exciting interest, and I do not know that the Italian Naval Academy, which we passed on the way, was very exciting, though with its villa grounds it had a pleasing rural effect. Hard by our hotel, in a piazza that seemed to have nothing to do but surround it, was the colossal bust of an Italian admiral, or the like, which had not the impressiveness of a colossal full-length figure, but which rendered the original with the faithful realism of the Genoese Campo Santo sculpture. In compensation there was, toward the city, near the ship-yards where the great Italian battle-ships are built, the statue of their builder - a man who looked it - standing at large ease, with one hand in his pantaloons pocket, and not apparently conscious of the passer's gaze. Beyond the ship-yard, in which a battle-ship was then receiving the last touches, was a statue for which I could not claim an equal unconsciousness. In fact, it challenged the public attention and even homage as it extended the baton of command and triumphed over the four Moorish or Algerine corsairs who, in their splendid nudity, were chained to the several corners of the monument and owned themselves galley-slaves. The Medicean grand-duke who lords it over them, and who erected this monument in honor of himself for the victories his admirals had gained in sweeping the pirates from the seas, is a very proud presence, and is certainly worthy of the admiration which his bronze requires from the spectator. I instantly suspected this monument of being the chief sculpture of Leghorn, and I did not wonder that a valet de place was lying in wait for me there to make me observe that from a certain point I could get all four of the galley-slaves' noses in perspective at once. Upon experiment I did not find that I could do this, but I imputed my failure to want of merit in myself and not the monument, and I willingly paid half a franc for the suggestion; if all one's failures cost so little, one could save money. I was going then to view at close quarters the port of Leghorn, which is famous for its mole and lighthouse and quarantine, the first of their kind in their time. The old port, with the fortifications, was the work of a natural son of Queen Elizabeth's Earl of Leicester, whose noble origin was so constantly recognized by the Tuscan grand-dukes that he came at last to be accepted as Lord Dudley by the English. From his day, if not from his work, the prosperity of Leghorn began, and the English have always had a great part in it. Early in the nineteenth century there were a score of great British merchants settled there, and, though afterward they declined in number, the trade with England did not decline, and the trade with America has always been such that American merchants and captains have fully shared in the commerce directly or indirectly. Both the old and the new port were a scene of pleasant activity the pleasant afternoon when I visited them, and were full of varied sail as well as many steamers, loading or unloading for or from the Mediterranean ports, east and west, and the Hanseatic cities and the far coasts of Norway. Any seaport is charming and full of romantic interest, but an Italian port has always a prime picturesqueness. Its sailors are the most ancient mariners, and they look full of history, and capable, each of them, of discovering a continent. I cannot say that I saw any nascent Columbus in the tanned and tarry company I met, but I do not deny that there was one. Leghorn is still in her lusty youth, being not much older than our Boston in the prosperity which has not failed her since the Medici divined her importance toward the close of the sixteenth century, and fortified her harbor till she was one of the strongest places on the Mediterranean. With a hazy general consciousness of her modernity in mind, I had imagined her yet more modern, and I was somewhat surprised to read, in a rather airy and ironical but very capable local guidebook called Su e Giu per Livorno (or Up and Down Leghorn), that the place was settled twenty-six hundred and fifty-six years before Christ. The author records this with a smile, and then, by a leap over some forty centuries, he finds firm footing in the fact that the great Countess Matilde, then much bothering about in the affairs of her Tuscan neighbors everywhere, gave the Livornese coasts to Pisa in 1103. This seems to have been the signal for the Genoese, eleven years later, to ravage and destroy the Pisan settlements; but later the Pisans, confirmed in their possession by the Emperor of Germany, rebuilt and embellished the port. A century after, Charles of Anjou demolished it, and then the Pisans fortified it some more. Then, in the last years of the thirteenth century, the Florentines, Lucchese, and Genoese devastated the whole territory of Pisa, and left Leghorn only one poor little church. Well throughout the fourteenth century there were wars between these republics, and Leghorn suffered the consequences, being, as our author says, \\\"according to custom, assailed, taken, wasted, and destroyed.\\\" But before that century was out she seems to have flourished up again, and to have received with all honor Gregory XL, returning from Avignon to Rome and bringing the papacy back from its long exile to the Eternal City. The Genoese now sold Leghorn to Milan, and in 1407 she was sold to France for twenty-six thousand florins, which seems low for a whole city. But in less than ten years we find the Genoese back again, and strengthening and adorning her at the greatest rate. It was quite time now that she should be visited by a virulent pestilence, and that, having passed to Florence in the meanwhile, she should have been ceded without a blow to Charles VIII. of France. But in a year she was once more in the hold of Florence and helping that republic fight her enemies the Pisans, and her other enemies under the Emperor Maximilian of Germany. More fortifying, embellishing, and pestilence followed, and in 1429 Michelangelo came to inspect the new fortifications which the Florentine republic had built at Leghorn to repair the damages she had suffered. The next year the republic fell, and Alessandro de' Medici, who came in master at Florence, took Leghorn into the favor which his family continued to show her to the end. The first Cosimo greatly improved her harbor, dug canals, and built forts, but he let the Spaniards, for a pleasure to Charles V., place garrisons in Florence, Pisa, and Leghorn, and the Spaniards remained six years at Leghorn. In the last year of the sixteenth century Ferdinand erected to himself the superb monument with the four captive corsairs at the corners, whose noses I had failed to get in range, and in the meanwhile many great public works had been constructed and the city desolated by another plague. It was now time for the English to appear in those waters, and in 1652 they were defeated by the Dutch off Leghorn. About seventy-five years later the grippe paid Leghorn a first visit, and not long after a violent earthquake shook down many buildings and killed many women and children; but the authorities did what they could to secure the city in future by declaring the day a perpetual fast, and forbidding masking and dancing on it. No disaster worth recording befell the city till Bonaparte came with the Rights of Man in 1796 and left a French garrison, which evacuated the place the next year, after having levied a fine of two million francs. The year after that Nelson occupied it with eight thousand English troops, and the following year the French reoccupied it and sacked the churches and imposed another fine nearly as great as the first. After the Napoleonic victories in the Italian wars, they seem to have come back again and fined the city two million francs more. They now remained five years, and in the mean time a Livornese, Giovanni Antonio Giaschi, invented a submarine-boat for attacking and destroying war-vessels, and a Spanish ship brought the yellow-fever. In 1808 Napoleon gave all Tuscany, and Leghorn with it, to his sister Elisa, but when in 1814 he was deposed, Leghorn was restored to the Tuscan grand-dukes and garrisoned for them by German troops, an earthquake having profited by the general disorder meantime to pay it another visit. The grand-duke now being driven out of Florence by Murat, he took refuge at Leghorn, which fell a prey to an epidemic of typhus. The first steam-vessel appared there in 1818, and in 1835 the Asiatic cholera; in 1847 a telegraphic line to Pisa was opened. In 1848 the revolutions prevalent throughout Europe had their effect at Leghorn. The citizens shared in the uprising against the grand-duke, and elected among its representatives F. D. Guerrazzi, once famous as the first of Italian novelists and a man of generous mind and heart, who duly suffered arrest and imprisonment when the grand-duke was restored by the Austrians. He was sentenced to fifteen years' prison with hard labor, but later his sentence was commuted to exile. He lived to return and take part in the Italian unification in 1860, and in 1866 he led the movement against making peace with Austria unless all her Italian-speaking provinces were ceded to Italy. He died in 1873, and is remembered in Leghorn by a monument very ineffective as a whole, but singularly interesting in certain details. I have omitted from this catalogue of events many of peaceful interest, such as visits from popes, princes, and poets, and I am not sure I have got in all the plagues and earthquakes. Perhaps I have the more willingly suppressed a few war-like facts, in the interest of the superstition I had cherished that Leghorn was without a history, or that it had no more history than, most American cities of equal date with its commercial importance, which began with the wise hospitality of the Medici to merchants of all races and nations, religions and races, settled there, and especially to the Spanish Jews who came in great numbers to the city that it was a common saying that you had as well strike the duke as strike a Jew in Leghorn. Greeks, Turks, Armenians were protected equally with English and Dutch, and infidel and heretic were alike free in their worship. It was the great prison of the galley-slaves, who were chiefly the pirates and corsairs taken on the high seas by the duke's ships. These captives not only served as models for the Moors at the base of his monument, but they must have been very useful in the different public works which he and his successors carried out. Now they and their like are gone, and though the Greeks, the Armenians, the English, and the Scotch still have their churches, I do not suppose there is a mosque in all Leghorn. \\nI do not speak very confidently, because my researches in that sort were not exhaustive. I indeed visited the cathedral, not wholly because Inigo Jones had something to do in planning it, but because I had formed the habit of visiting churches in Rome, and I mechanically went into one wherever I saw it. Generally speaking, I think that they were rather bare in painting or sculpture, but they were such churches as in America one would go a long way to see and think one's self well rewarded by their objects of interest. I do not know what defence to offer for not having visited the galleries of the Museo Civico, where by actual count in the guide-book I missed one hundred and sixty-nine works of art, though just how many masterpieces I am not able to say: probably one out of every ten was a masterpiece. But, if I did not much resort to the churches and galleries in Leghorn, I roamed gladly through its pleasant streets and squares, and by the shores of the canals which once gave it the name of New Venice, and which still invite the smaller shipping up among its houses in right Venetian fashion. The streets of Leghorn are not so straight as they are long, but many are very straight, and the others are curved rather than crooked. The longest and straight-est were streets of low dwelling-houses, uncommon in Italian towns, where each family lived under its own roof with a little garden behind, and a respective entrance, as people still mostly do in our towns. From the force of the mid-April sun in these streets I realized what they might be in summer, and, if I lived in Leghorn, I would rather live on the sea-front, in one of the comfortable, square, stone villas which border it. But everywhere Leghorn seemed a pleasant place to live, and convenient, with lively shops and cafes and trams and open spaces, and statues and monuments in them. The city, I understood, is of somewhat radical politics, tending from clericalism to socialism; and, like every other Italian city, it is full of patriotic monuments. There is a Victor Emmanuel on horseback, plump and squat, but heroic as always, and a Garibaldi struggling in vain for beauty in his poncho and his round, flat cap; there is a Mazzini, there is a Cavour, and, above all, there is a Guerrazzi, no great thing as to the seated figure, but most interesting, most touching in two of the bas-reliefs below. One represents him proclaiming the provisional government at Florence in 1849, after the expulsion of the grand-duke, where the fact is studied, with the wonderful realism of the Italians, in all its incidents and the costumes of the thronging spectators. The sculptor has hesitated at no top-hat or open umbrella; there are barefooted boys and bareheaded young girls, as well as bearded elders; if my memory serves, the scene is not without a dog or two. But it is the other relief which is so simply and so deeply affecting - the interior of a narrow cell, with one chair and a rude table, at which the patriot novelist wrote his greatest work, The Siege of Florence, and with him standing a little way from it. In spite of the small space and the almost vacant stage, the scene is full of most moving drama, and records a whole Italian epoch, now happily past forever. These are modern sculptures, and they scarcely contest the palm with the monument of the four galley-slaves and the Medicean grand-duke. In another piazza two princes of the Lorrainese family, if I remember rightly, face each other over its oblong - classic motives, with the figures much undraped, and one of them singularly impressive from the mutton-chop whiskers which modernized him. There are several theatres, and among them a Goldoni theatre, as there should be in a city where the sweet old playwright sojourned for a time and has placed the action of his famous comedy, \\\"La Locandiera.\\\" But I was told that the local theatres were not so much frequented by polite people, especially for opera, as the theatre in Pisa, which, if poorer, is prouder in its society than its old-time vassal by the sea, and attracts the fashion of Leghorn during the season. As Pisa has ceased to be the colony of literary English it once was, in the time of Byron and Hunt and Shelley, to name no others, so Leghorn has ceased to be the mercantile colony of former days. It has still a great deal of commerce with England, but this is no longer carried on by resident merchants, though here and there an English name lingers in the style of a business house; and the distinctive qualities of both colonies are united in the author of a charming book who fills the post of British consul at Leghorn. His Tuscan Towns must not be confused with another book called Tuscan Cities, though, if the traveller chooses to carry both with him about Tuscany, I will not say that he could do better. In Tuscan Cities there is nothing about Leghorn, I believe, but in Tuscan Towns there is a specially delightful chapter about the place, its people, language, and customs which I can commend to the reader as the best corrective of the errors I must have been constantly falling into here. It was in company no less enviable than this author's that I revisited the port on a gray Sunday afternoon of my stay, and then for the first time visited the ancient fortifications which began to be in the time of the Countess Matilde and intermittently increased under the rule of the Pisan, Genoese, and Florentine republics, until the Medicean grand-dukes amplified them in almost the proportions I saw. The brutal first duke of their line, Alessandro de' Medici, who some say was no Medici, but the bastard of a negro and a washerwoman, stamped his creed in the inscription below his adoptive arms, \\\"Under one Faith and one Law, one Lord,\\\" and it was in the palace here, the story goes, that the wicked Cosimo I. killed his son Don Garzia before the eyes of the boy's mother. Anything is imaginable of an early Medicean grand-duke, but in a manner the father's murderous fury was provoked by the fact, if it was a fact, that Don Garzia had just mortally wounded his brother Giovanni. I should like to pretend that the tragedy had wrought in my unconsciousness to the effect of the pensive gloom which the old fortress cast over me, but perhaps I had better not. There are some gray Sunday afternoons of a depressing effect on the spirit which requires no positive or palpable reason. In any case it was a relief to go from the shadow of the past there through the pleasant city streets to the gentle quiet of the British cemetery, where so many of our race and some even of our own nation are taking their long rest. No one is now buried there, and the place, in the gradual diminution of the English colony at Leghorn, has fallen into a lovely and appealing neglect if not oblivion. Oblivion quite covers its origin, but it is almost as old as Protestantism itself, and, if the ground for it was the gift of the grand-duke who tolerated heretics as well as Jews in the impulse he gave to the city's growth, it would not be strange. The beautiful porch of the English church, for once Greek and not Gothic, fronts upon it, but the dwindling congregation has no care of it, and there is no fund to keep it so much as free from weeds and brambles and the insidious ivy rending its monuments asunder. The afternoon of our visit it was in the sole charge of a large, gray cat, which, after feasting upon the favorite herb, lay stretched in sleep on a sunny bed of catnip under the walls of a mansion near, at whose windows some young girls looked down in a Sunday listlessness, as we wandered about among the \\\"tall cypresses, myrtles, pines, eucalyptus-trees, oleanders, cactuses, huge bushes of monthly roses, a jungle of periwinkles, sarsaparilla, wild irises, violets, and other loveliest of wild flowers.\\\" On the forgotten tombs were the touching epitaphs of those who had died in exile, and whose monuments are sometimes here while their ashes lie in Florence or Rome, or wherever else they chanced to meet their end. Among them were the inscriptions on the graves of \\\"William Magee Seton, merchant of New York,\\\" who died at Pisa in 1803, and \\\"Henry De Butts, a citizen of Baltimore, N. America,\\\" who died at Sarzana; with \\\"James M. Knight, Esq., Captain of Marines, Citizen of the United States of America,\\\" who died at Leghorn in 1802; and \\\"Thomas Gamble, Late Captain in the Navy of the United States of America,\\\" who died at Pisa in 1818; and doubtless there were other Americans whose tombs I did not see. The memorials of the English were likewise here, whether they died at Leghorn or not; but most of them seem to have ended their lives in that place, where there were once so many English residents, whether for their health or their profit. The youth of some testified to the fact that they had failed to find the air specific for their maladies, and doubtless this would account also for the disproportionate number of noble ladies who rest here, with their hatchments and their coronets and robes of state carven on the stones above them. Among others one reads the titles of \\\"Lady Catharine Burgess born Beauclerk; Jane Isabella, widow of the Earl of Lanesborough and daughter of the Earl of Molesworth; and Catharine Murray, only child of James Murray,... and the Right Honorable Lady Catharine Stewart his Spouse,\\\" with knights, admirals, generals, and other military and naval officers a many. Most important of all is the tomb of that strenuous spirit, more potent for good and ill in the English fiction of his time than any other novelist of his time, and second only to Richardson in the wide influence of his literary method, Tobias Smollett, namely, who here ended his long fight with consumption and the indifference of his country to his claims upon her official recognition. After many years of narrow circumstance in the Southern climates where he spent his later life, he tried in vain for that meek hope of literary ambition, a consulate, perhaps the very post that my companion, a hundred and fifty years later, was worthily holding. The truest monument to his stay in Italy is the book of Italian travel that he wrote, and the best effect is that sort of peripatetic novel which he may be said to have invented in Humphrey Clinker, and which has survived the epistolary form into our own time. It is a very simple shaft that rises over his grave, with the brief record, \\\"Memoriae Tobiae Smollett, qui Liburni animam efflavit, 16 Sept., 1773,\\\" but it is imaginable with what wrath he would have disputed the record, if it is true, according to all the other authorities, that he exhaled his spirit two years earlier, and how he would have had it out with those \\\"friends and fellow-countrymen\\\" who had the error perpetuated above his helpless dust. It was not easy to quit the sweetly solemn place or to resist the wish which I have here indulged, that some kinsman or kinswoman of those whom the blossoms and leaves are hiding would come to their rescue from nature now claiming an undue part in them, and obliterating their very memories. One would not have a great deal done, but only enough to save their names from entire oblivion, and with the hope of this I have named some of their names. It might not be too much even for the United Kingdom and the United States, though both very poor nations, to join in contributing the sum necessary for the work. Or some millionaire English duke, or some millionaire American manufacturer, might make the outlay alone; I cannot expect any millionaire author to provide a special fund for the care of the tomb of Smollett. \\n\\nVIII. OVER AT PISA \\nIf the half-hour between Leghorn and Pisa had been spent in any less lovely transit, I should still be grieving for the loss of the thirty minutes which might so much better have been given to either place. But with the constant line of mountains enclosing the landscape on the right, in all its variety of tillage, pasture-land, vineyard, and orchard, and the unchanging level which had once been the bed of the sea, we were gainers in sort beyond the gift of those cities. We had the company, great part of the way, of more stone-pines than we had seen even between Naples and Rome, here gathering into thick woods, with the light beautiful beneath the spread of their horizontal boughs, there grouped in classic groves, and yonder straying off in twos and threes. We had the canal that of old time made Pisa a port of the Mediterranean, with Leghorn for her servant on the shore (or, if it was not this canal, it was another as straight and long), with a peasant walking beside it, under a light-green umbrella, in the showers which threatened our start but spared our arrival. We had then the city, with its domes and towers, grown full height out of the plain through which the Arno curves in the stateliest crescent of all its course. The day had turned finer than any other day I can now think of in my whole life, and I was once more in Pisa without the care for its history or art or even novelty which had corroded my mind in former visits. I had been there twice before - once in 1864, when I had done its wonders with all the wonder they merited, and again in 1883, when I had lived its memories on the scene of its manifold and mighty experiences. No distinct light from that learning vexed my present vision, but an agreeable mist of association, nothing certain, nothing tangible remaining, but only a gentle vague involving everything, in which I could possess my soul in peace. In this glimmer I recognized a certain cabman as having been waiting there from the dawn of time, with his dark-eyed little son, to make me his willing captive at something above the tariff rates, but destined by the same fate to serve me well, and to part with me friends at the close of the day for a franc more than the excess agreed upon. It costs so small a sum to corrupt the common carrier in Italy that I hold it wrong to fail of any chance, and this driver had not only a horse of uncommon qualities, but he spoke a beautiful Tuscan, and he had his Pisa at his fingers' ends. \\nWe were of one mind about driving without delay to the famous group which is without rival on the earth, though there may be associated edifices in the red planet Mars that surpass the Cathedral, the Leaning Tower, the Baptistery, and the Campo Santo at Pisa. What genius it was imagined placing them in the pleasant meadow where they sit, just beyond the city streets, I do not know, but it was inspiration beyond any effect of mere taste, and it commanded my worship as much the last as the first time. The meadow still swims round them and breaks in a foam of daisies at their feet; for I take it that it is always mid-April there, and that the grass is as green and the sun as yellow on it as the afternoon we saw it. The sacred edifices are as golden as the light on them, and there is such a joyous lift in the air that it is a wonder they do not swing loose from their foundations and soar away into the celestial blue. For travellers in our willing mood there was, of course, the predestined cicerone waiting for us at the door of the cathedral, who would fix no price for the pleasure he was born to do us, yet still consented to take more than twice that he ought to have had at parting. But he was worth the money; he was worth quite two francs, and, though he was not without the fault of his calling and would have cumbered us with instruction, I will not blame him, for after a moment I perceived that his intelligence was such that I might safely put my hands in my pocket on my shut guide-book and follow him from point to point without fear of missing anything worth noting. Among the things worthiest noting, I saw, as if I had never seen them before, the unforgettable, forgotten Andrea del Sartos, especially the St. Agnes, in whose face you recognize the well-known features of the painter's wife, but with a gentler look than they usually wore in his Madonnas, perhaps because he happened to study these from that difficult lady when she was in her least celestial moods. Besides the masterpieces of other masters, there is a most noble Sodoma, which the great Napoleon carried away to Paris and which the greater French people afterward restored. At every step in the beautiful temple you may well pause, for it abounds in pictures and sculptures, the least of which would enrich St. Peter's at Rome beyond the proudest effect of its poverty-stricken grandeur. Ghirlandajo, Michelangelo, Gaddo Gaddi, John of Bologna - the names came back to me out of a past of my own almost as remote as theirs, while our guide repeated them, in their relation to the sculptures or pictures or architecture, with those of lesser lights of art, and that school of Giotto, of all whose frescos once covering its walls the fire of three hundred years ago has left a few figures clinging to one of the pillars, faint and uncertain as the memories of my own former visits to the church. I did, indeed, remember me of an old bronze lamp, by Vincenzo Possenti, hanging from the roof, which I now revered the third time, at intervals of twenty years; from its oscillation Galileo is said to have got the notion of the pendulum; but it is now tied back with a wire, being no longer needed for such an inspiration. Mostly in this last visit I took Pisa as lightly as at the first, when, as I have noted from the printed witness, I was gayly indifferent to the claims of her objects of interest. If they came in my way, I looked at them, but I did not put myself much about for them. I rested mostly in the twilight of old associations, trusting to the guidance of our cicerone, whom, in some form or under some name, the reader will find waiting for him at the cathedral door as we did. But I have since recurred to the record of my second visit in 1883, with amazement at the exact knowledge of events shown there, which became, in 1908, all a blur of dim conjecture. It appears that I was then acquainted with much more Pisan history than any other author I have found own to. I had also surprising adventures of different kinds, such as my poorer experience of the present cannot parallel. I find, for instance, that in 1883 I gave a needy crone in the cathedral a franc instead of the piece of five centimes which I meant for her, and that the lamp of Galileo did nothing to light the gloom into which this error plunged my spirit. It appears to have jaundiced my view of the whole cathedral, which I did not find at all comparable to that of Siena, whereas in 1908 I thought it all beautiful. This may have been because I was so newly from the ugliness of the Eoman churches; though I felt, as I had felt before, that the whole group of sacred edifices at Pisa was too suggestive of decorative pastry and confectionery. No more than at the second view of it did I now attempt the ascent of the Leaning Tower; I had discharged this duty for life when I first saw it; with my seventy-one years upon me, I was not willing to climb its winding stairs, and I doubted if I could keep it from falling, as I then did, by inclining myself the other way. I resolved that I would leave this to the new-comer; but I gladly followed our cicerone across the daisied green from the cathedral to the baptistery, where I found the famous echo waiting to welcome me back, and greet me with its angelic sweetness, when the custodian who has it in charge appealed to it; though its voice seemed to have been weakened and coarsened in its forced replies to some rude Americans there, who shouted out to it and mocked at it. One wished to ask them if they did not know that this echo was sacred, and that their challenges of it were a species of sacrilege. But doubtless that would not have availed to silence them. By-and-by they went away, and then we were aware of an interesting group of people by the font near the lovely Lombardic pulpit of Nicola Pisano. They were peasants, by their dress - a young father and mother and a little girl or two, and then a gentle, elderly woman, with a baby in her arms, at which she looked proudly down. They were in their simple best, and they had good Tuscan faces, full of kindness. I ventured some propitiatory coppers with the children, and, when the old woman made them thank me, I thought I could not be mistaken and I ventured further: \\\"You are the grandmother?\\\" \\\"Yes, signer,\\\" she answered; and then we had some talk about the age and the beauty of the baby, which I declared wonderful for both, in praises loud enough for the father and mother to hear. After that they seemed to hold a family council, from which I thought it respectful to stand apart until the grandmother spoke to me again. I did not understand, and I appealed to our guide for help. \\\"She wishes you to be godfather to the child.\\\" I had never yet been a godfather, but I had the belief that it brought grave responsibilities, which in the very casual and impermanent circumstances I did not see how I was to meet. Yet how to refuse without wounding these kind people who had so honored me I did not know until a sudden inspiration came to my rescue. \\\"Tell them,\\\" I said, \\\"and be careful to make them understand, that I am very grateful and very sorry, but that I am a Protestant, and that I suppose I cannot, for that reason, be godfather to their child.\\\" He explained, and they received my thanks and regrets with smiling acquiescence; and just then a very stout little old priest (who has baptized nearly all the babies in Pisa for fifty years) came in, and the baptism proceeded without my intervention. But I remained, somehow, disappointed; it would have been pleasant to leave a godchild behind me there in the neighborhood of Pisa; to have sent him from time to time some little remembrance of this remote America, and, perhaps, when he grew up and came to Pisa, and learned the art of the statuary, to have had from him a Leaning Tower which he had cut in alabaster for me. I was taking it for granted he was a boy, but he may not have been; there is always that chance. If I had been alone, I suppose I should still have gone into the Campo Santo, from mere force of habit; I always go, in Pisa, but I had now with me clearer eyes for art than mine are, and I wished to have their light on the great allegories and histories frescoed round the cloisters, and test with them the objects of my tacit and explicit reserves and misgivings. I needed such eyes, and even some such powerful glasses as would have pierced through the faded and wasted pictures and shown them at least as I had first seen them. They were then in such reasonable disrepair as one might expect after three or four centuries, but in the last thirty years a ruinous waste has set in before which not only the colors have faded, but the surfaces have crumbled under the colors; and as yet no man knows how to stop the ravage. I think I have read that it is caused by a germ; but, if not, the loss is the same, and until a parasite for the germ is found the loss must go on, and the work of Giotto, of Benozzo Gozzoli, of Memmi, must perish with that of the Orgagnas, which may indeed go, for all me. Bible stories, miracles, allegories - they are all hasting to decay, and it can be but a few years until they shall vanish like the splendors of the dawn which they typify in art. In some things the ruin is not altogether to be regretted. It has softened certain loathsome details of the charnel facts portrayed, and in other pictures the torment and anguish of the lost souls are no longer so painful as the old painters ascertained them. Hell in the Campo Santo is not now the hell of other days, just as the hell of Christian doctrine is not the hell it used to be. Death and the world are indeed immitigable; the corpses in their coffins are as terrifying to the gay lords and ladies who come suddenly upon them as ever they were, though doubtless of no more lasting effect with such sinners than they would be nowadays. But what one must chiefly lament is the waste of the whole quaint and charming series of Scripture incidents by Benozzo Gozzoli. This is indeed most lamentable, and after realizing the loss one is only a little heartened by the gayety of certain grieving widows, sitting in marble for monuments to their husbands at several points under the arcades. What cheer they might have brought us was impaired by the sight of the sarcophaguses and the other antiques against the walls, which inflicted an inappeasable ache for the city where such things abound, and brought our refluent Romesickness back full tide upon us. More than once Pisa elsewhere did us the like involuntary unkindness; she, too, is yellow and mellow like Rome, and she had moments of the Piazza Navona and the Piazza di Spagna which were poignant. But she had moments of her own when Rome could not rival her - such, for instance, as that when she invited us from the perishing frescos of her Campo Santo to turn our eyes on the flower-strewn field of death which the cloisters surrounded, and where in the hallowed earth which her galleys brought from Jerusalem her children, in their several turns, used to sleep so sweetly and safely. The afternoon sunlight was prolonging the day there as well as it could, and we should have liked to linger with it as late as it would, but there were other places in Pisa calling us, and we must go. We found our driver, and his black-eyed boy beside him on the box, waiting for us at the cathedral door, and we seem to have left it pretty much to them where we should go. They decided us, if we really left it to them, mainly for the outside of things, so that we might see as much of Pisa as possible; but it appears to have been their notion that we ought to visit, at least, the inside of the Church of the Knights of St. Stephen. I do not know whether I protested or not that I had abundantly seen this already, but, at any rate, I am now glad that they took us there. As every traveller will pretend to remember, the main business of the knights was to fight the Barbary pirates, and the main business of their church is now to serve as a repository of the prows of the galleys and the flags which they took in their battles with the infidels. There are other monuments of their valor, but by all odds the flags will be the most interesting to the American visitor, because of the start that many of them will give him by their resemblance to our own banner, with their red-and-white stripes, which the eye follows in vivid expectation of finding the blue field of stars in the upper left-hand corner. It never does find this, and that is the sufficient reason for holding to the theory that our flag was copied from the armorial bearings of the Washington family, and not taken from the standard of those paynim corsairs; but there is poignant instant when one trembles. We viewed, of course, the exterior of the edifice standing on the site of the Tower of Famine, where the cruel archbishop starved the Count Ugolino and his grandchildren to death; and we drove by the buildings of Pisa's famous university, which we afterward fancied rather pervaded the city with the young and ardent life of its students. It is no great architectural presence, but there are churches and palaces to make up for that. Everywhere you chance on them in the narrow streets and the ample piazzas, but the palaces follow mostly the stately curve of the Arno, where some of them have condescended to the office of hotels, and where, I believe, one might live in economy and comfort; or, at any rate, I should like to try. It would get rather warm there in May, and July and August are not to be thought of, but all the other year it would be divine, with such a prospect as can hardly be matched anywhere else. Pisa used once to be the resort of many seeking health or warmth, and for mere climate it ought again to come into favor. Probably there is reasonably accessible society there, and, as the Livornese believe, there is at least excellent opera. The time might grow long, but ought not to be very heavy, and there is a cafe, at the very finest point of the curve, where you can get an excellent cup of tea. Whether this attests the resort or sojourn of many English, or the growth of the tea-habit among the Pisans, I cannot say, but that cafe is very charming, with students standing about in it and admiring the ladies who come in to buy pastry, and who do not suppose there is any one there to look at them. I am sure that the handsome mother with the pretty daughter who lingered so long over their choice of little cakes could not have imagined any one was looking, or she would at once have taken macaroons and hurried away: at that cafe they have macaroons almost three inches across, and delicious. \\nThe whole keeping was so pleasant that we hated to leave it to the lengthening shadows from the other shore, but we were to drive down the Arno into the promenade that follows it, I do not know how far; with the foolish greed of travel, we wanted to get in all of Pisa that we could, even if we tore ourselves from its most tempting morsel. But it was all joy, and I should like, at this moment, to be starting on that enchanting drive again. I leave the reader to imagine the lovely scenery for himself; almost any of my many backgrounds will serve; but I will supply him with a piece of statistics such as does not fall in everybody's way. We noted the great number of anglers who lined the opposite bank, with no appearance of catching anything, and I asked our driver if they never happened to get a bite. \\\"Not in the daytime,\\\" he explained, compassionately, \\\"but as soon as the evening comes they get all the fish they want.\\\" I could pour out on the reader many other Pisan statistics, but they would be at second-hand. After long vicissitude, the city is again almost as prosperous as she was in the heyday of her national greatness, when she had commerce with every Levantine and Oriental port. We ourselves saw a silk factory pouring forth a tide of pretty girls from their work at the end of the day; there was no ruin or disrepair noticeable anywhere, and the whole city was as clean as Rome, with streets paved with broad, smooth flagstones where you never missed the rubber tires which your carriage failed of. But Pisa had a great air of resting, of taking life easily after a tumultuous existence in the long past which she had put behind her. Throughout the Middle Ages she was always fighting foreign foes without her walls or domestic factions within, now the Saracens wherever she could find them or they could find her, now the Normans in Naples, now the Cor-sicans and Sardinians, now Lucca, now Genoa, now Florence, and now all three. Her wars with these republics were really incessant; they were not so much wars as battles in one long war, with a peace occasionally made during the five or ten or fifteen years, which was no better than a truce. When she fell under the Medici, together with her enemy Florence, she shared the death-quiet the tyrants brought that prepotent republic, and it was the Medicean strength probably which saved her from Lucca and Genoa, though it left them to continue republics down to the nineteenth century. She was at one time an oligarchy, and at another a democracy, and at another the liege of this prince or that priest, but she was never out of trouble as long as she possessed independence or the shadow of it. In the safe hold of united Italy she now sits by her Arno and draws long, deep breaths, which you may almost hear as you pass; and I hope the prospect of increasing prosperity will not tempt her to work too hard. It does not look as if it would. We were getting a little anxious, but not very anxious, for that one cannot be in Pisa, about our train back to Leghorn; though we did not wish to go, we did not wish to be left; but our driver reassured us, and would not let us shirk the duty of seeing the house where Galileo was born. We found it in a long street on the thither side of the river, and in such a poor quarter that our driver could himself afford to live only a few doors from it. As if they had expected him to pass about this time, his wife and his five children were sitting at his door and playing before it. He proudly pointed them out with his whip, and one of the little ones followed on foot far enough to levy tribute. They were sufficiently comely children, but blond, whereas the boy on the box was both black-eyed and black-haired. When we required an explanation of the mystery, the father easily solved it; this boy was the child of his first wife. If there were other details, I have forgotten them, but we made our romance to the effect that the boy, to whose beautiful eyes we now imputed a lurking sadness, was not happy with his step-mother, and that he took refuge from her on the box with his father. They seemed very good comrades; the boy had shared with his father the small cakes we had given him at the cafe. At the station, in recognition of his hapless lot, I gave him half a franc. By that time his father was radiant from the small extortion I had suffered him to practice with me, and he bade the boy thank me, which he did so charmingly that I almost, but not quite, gave him another half-franc. Now I am sorry I did not. Pisa was worth it. \\n\\nIX. BACK AT GENOA \\nThere is an old saying, probably as old as Genoa's first loot of her step-sister republic, \\\"If you want to see Pisa, you must go to Genoa,\\\" which may have obscurely governed us in our purpose of stopping there on our way up out of Italy. We could not have too much of Pisa, as apparently the Genoese could not; but before our journey ended I decided that they would have thought twice before plundering Pisa if they had been forced to make their forays by means of the present railroad connection between the two cities. At least there would have been but one of the many wars of murder and rapine between the republics, and that would have been the first. After a single experience of the eighty tunnels on that line, with the perpetually recurring necessity of putting down and putting up the car-window, no army would have repeated the invasion; and, though we might now be without that satirical old saying, mankind would, on the whole, have been the gainer. As it was, the enemies could luxuriously go and come in their galleys and enjoy the fresh sea-breezes both ways, instead of stifling in the dark and gasping for breath as they came into the light, while their train ran in and out under the serried peaks that form the Mediterranean shore. I myself wished to take a galley from Leghorn, or even a small steamer, but I was overruled by less hardy but more obdurate spirits, and so we took the Florentine express at Pisa, where we changed cars. The Italian government had providently arranged that the car we changed into should be standing beyond the station in the dash of an unexpected shower, and that it should be provided with steps so high and steep, with Italian ladies standing all over them and sticking their umbrellas into the faces of American citizens trying to get in after them, that it was a feat of something like mountain-climbing to reach the corridor, and then of daring-do to secure a compartment. Though a collectivist, with a firm belief in the government ownership of railroads everywhere, I might have been tempted at times in Italy to abjure my creed if I had not always reflected that the state there had just come into possession of the roads, with all their capitalistic faults of management and outwear of equipment which it would doubtless soon reform and repair. I venture to suggest now, however, that its prime duty is to have platforms level with the car-doors, as they are in England, and not to let Italian ladies stand in the doorways with their umbrellas. I do not insist that it shall impose silence and sobriety upon a party of young French people in the next compartment, but I do think it should remove those mountains back from the sea so that the trains carrying cultivated Americans can run along the open shore the whole way to Genoa. Pending this, it should provide strong and watchful employees to lower and raise the windows at the mouth of each of the eighty tunnels in every car. I do not demand that it shall change the site of the station in Genoa so that it shall not always be the city's whole length away from the hotel you have chosen, but I think this would be a desirable improvement, especially if it is after dark when you arrive and raining a peculiarly cold, disagreeable rain. That rain was very disappointing; for, in the intervals between tunnels, we had fancied, from the few brief glimpses we caught of the landscape, that the April so backward elsewhere in Italy was forwarder in the blossomed trees along the eastern Riviera; and we learned at our hotel that the steam-heat had just been taken off because the day had been so hot and dry, though the evening was now so cold and wet. It was fitfully put on and off during the chilly week that ensued, though in our fifth-story garden, to which we sometimes resorted, there was a mildness in the air that was absent in-doors. The hotel itself was disappointing; any hotel would be after our hotel in Leghorn; and, though there was the good-will of former days, there was not the former effect. The corridors crashed and clattered all day long and well into the night with the gayety of some cheap incursion of German tourists, who seemed, indeed, to fill the whole city with their clamor. They were given a long table to themselves, and when they were set at it and began to ply their knives and tongues the din was deafening. That would not have been so bad if they had not been so plain, or if, when they happened, in a young girl or two, to be pretty, they had not guttled and guzzled so like the plainest of their number. One such pretty girl was really beautiful, with a bloom perhaps already too rich, which, as she abandoned herself to her meat and drink, reddened downward over her lily neck and upward to her golden hair, past the brows under which her blue, blue eyes protruded painfully, all in a frightful prophecy of what she would be when the bud of her spring should be the full-blown cabbage-rose of her summer. I dare say those people were not typical of their civilization. Probably modern enterprise makes travel easy to sorts and conditions of Germans who once would not have dreamed of leaving home, and now tempts these rude Teutonic hordes over or under the Alps and pours them out on the Peninsula, far out-deluging the once-prevalent Anglo-Saxons. The first night there was an Englishman at dinner, but he vanished after breakfast; the next day an Italian officer was at lunch, but he came no more; we were the only Americans, and now we had the sole society of those German tourists. Perhaps it was national vanity, but I could not at the moment think of an equal number of our fellow-citizens of any condition who would not have been less molestively happy. One forgot what one was eating, and left the table bruised as if physically beaten upon by those sound-waves and sight-waves. But our companions must have made themselves acceptable to the city they had come to visit; Genoa is very noisy, and they could not be heard above the trams and omnibuses, and in the streets they could not be seen at table; when I ventured to note to a sacristan, here and there, that there seemed to be a great many Germans in town, the fact apparently roused nothing of the old-time Italian antipathy for the Tedeschi. Severally they may have been cultivated and interesting people; and that blooming maiden may really have been the Blue Flower of Romance that she looked before she began to dine. \\nWe were entering upon our third view of Genoa with the zest of our first, and I was glad to find there were so many things I had left unseen or had forgotten. First of all the Campo Santo allured me, and I went at once to verify the impressions of former years in a tram following the bed of a torrential river which was now dry except in the pools where the laundresses were at work, picturesquely as always in Italy. But here they were not alone the worthy theme of art; their husbands and fathers, and perhaps even their fiances, were at work with them, not, indeed, washing the linen, but spreading to dry it in snowy spaces over the clean gravel. On either bank of the stream newly finished or partly finished apartment-houses testified to the prosperity of the city, which seemed to be growing everywhere, and it would not be too bold to imagine this a favorite quarter because of its convenience to the Cam-po Santo. Already in the early forenoon our train was carrying people to that popular resort, who seemed to be intending to spend the day there. Some had wreaths and flowers, and were clearly sorrowing friends of the dead; others, with their guide-books, were as plainly mere sight-seers, and these were Italians as well as strangers, gratifying what seems the universal passion for cemeteries. In our own villages the graveyards are the favorite Sunday haunt of the young people and the scene of their love-making; and it has been the complaint of English visitors to our cities that the first thing their hosts took them to see was the cemetery. They did not realize that this was often the thing best worth showing them, for our feeble aesthetic instincts found their first expression in the attempt to dignify or beautify the homes of the dead. Each mourner grieved in marble as fitly as he knew how, and, if there was sometimes a rivalry in vaults and shafts, the effect was of a collective interest which all could feel. Sometimes it was touching, sometimes it was revolting; and in Italy it is not otherwise. The Campo Santo of San Miniato at Florence, the Campo Santo at Bologna, the Campo Santo wherever else you find it, you find of one quality with the Campo Santo at Genoa. It makes you the helpless confidant of family pride, of bruised and lacerated love, of fond aspiration, of religious longing, of striving faith, of foolish vanity and vulgar pretence, but, if the traveller would read the local civilization aright, he cannot do better than go to study it there. My third experience of the Genoese Campo Santo was different only in quantity from the first and second. There seemed more of the things, better and worse, but the increasing witness was of the art which rendered the fact with unsparing realism, sometimes alloyed with allegory and sometimes not, but always outright, literal, strong, rank. The hundreds of groups, reliefs, statues, busts; the long aisles where the dead are sealed in the tableted shelves of the wall, like the dead in the catacombs, the ample space of open ground enclosed by the cloisters and set thick with white crosses, are all dominated by a colossal Christ which, in my fancy, remains of very significant effect. It is as if no presence less mighty and impressive could centre in itself the multitudinous passions, wills, and hopes expressed in those incongruous monuments and reduce them to that unity of meaning which one cannot deny them. \\nThe Campo Santo of Genoa is a mortuary gloss of Genoese history: of the long succession of civic strifes and foreign wars common to all the Italian republics, now pacified at last by a spirit of unity, of brotherhood. At Genoa, more than anywhere else in Italy except Milan, you are aware of the North - its strenuousness, its enterprise, its restless outstretching for worlds beyond itself. Columbus came with the gift of a New World in his hand, and, in the fulness of time, Mazzini came with the gift of a Newer World in his hand: the realization of Christ in the ideal of duties without which the old ideal of rights is heathen and helpless. Against the rude force of Genoa, the aristocratic beauty of such a place as Pisa was nothing; only Florence and Venice might vie with her. But she had not the inspiration of Florence, her art, her literature; the dialect in which she uttered herself is harsh and crabbed, and no poet known beyond it has breathed his soul into it; her architecture was first the Gothic from over the Alps, and then of the Renaissance which built the palaces of her merchants in a giant bulk and of a brutal grandeur. She had not the political genius of Venice, the oligarchic instinct of self-preservation from popular misgovernment and princely aggression. Her story is the usual Italian story of a people jealous of each other, and, in their fear of a native tyrant, impatiently calling in one foreign tyrant after another and then furiously expelling him. When she would govern herself, she first made her elective chief magistrate Doge for life, and then for two years; under both forms she submitted and rebelled at will from 1359 till 1802, when, after having accepted the French notion of freedom from Bonaparte, she enjoyed a lion's share of his vicissitudes. For a hundred years before that the warring powers had fought over her in their various quarrels about successions, and she ought to have been well inured to suffering when, in 1800, the English and the Austrians besieged her French garrison, and twenty thousand of her people starved in a cause not their own. The English restored the Doges, and the Republic of Genoa fell at last nineteen years after the Republic of Venice and three hundred years after the Republic of Florence. She was given to Piedmont in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, and she has formed part of Italy ever since the unification. I believe that now she is of rather radical opinions in politics, though the bookseller who found on his shelves a last copy of the interesting sketch of Genoese history which I have profited by so little, said that the Genoese had been disappointed in the Socialists, lately in power, and were now voting Clerical by a large majority. The fact may have been colored by the book-seller's feelings. If the Clericals are in superior force, the clerics are not: nowhere in Italy did I see so few priests. All other orders of people throng the narrow, noisy, lofty streets, where the crash of feet and hoofs and wheels beats to the topmost stories of the palaces towering overhead in their stony grandiosity. Everywhere in the structures dating after the Gothic period there is want of sensibility; the art of the Renaissance was not moulded here in the moods of a refined and effeminate patriciate, such as in Venice tempered it to beauty; but it renders in marble the prepotence of a commercialized nobility, and makes good in that form the right of the city to be called Genoa the Proud. Perhaps she would not wish to be called proud because of these palaces alone. It is imaginable that she would like the stranger to remember the magnificence with which she rewarded the patriotism of her greatest citizen after Columbus and Mazzini: that mighty admiral, Andrea Doria, who freed this country first from the rule of Charles V. and then from the rule of Francis I.; who swept the Barbary corsairs from the seas; who beat the Turks in battles on ship and on shore; who took Corsica from the French when he was eighty-eight years old; who suffered from civil faction; who outlived exile as he had outlived war, and who died at the age of ninety-four, after he had refused the sovereignty of the country he had served so long; who was the Washington of his day, and was equally statesman and soldier, and, above all, patriot. It is his portrait that you see in that old palace (called the Palace of the Prince because Charles V. had called him Prince) overlooking the port, where he sits an old, old man, very weary, in the sole society of his sarcastic cat, as I have noted before. The cat seems to have just passed some ironical reflection on the vanity of human things and to be studying him for the effect. Both appear indifferent to the spectator, but perhaps they are not, and you must not for all that fail of a visit to the Church of San Matteo, set round with the palaces of the Doria family - the palace which his grateful country gave the Admiral after he refused to be her master, and the palaces of his kindred neighboring it round. I do not remember any equal space in all Europe which, through a very little knowledge, so takes the heart as the gentle little church founded by an earlier Doria, and, after four hundred years, restored by a later, and then environed with the stately homes of the race, where they could be domesticated in the honor and reverence of their countrymen because of the goodness and greatness of the loftiest of their line. It is such a place as one may revere and yet possess one's soul in self-respect, very much as one may revere Mount Vernon. The church, as well as the piazza, is full of Dorian memories, and the cloister must be visited not only for its rather damp beauty, but for the full meaning of the irony which Doria's cat in the portrait wished to convey: against the wall here are gathered the fragments of the statue of Doria which, when the French Revolution came to Genoa, the patriots threw out of the ducal palace and broke in the street below. We were some time in finding our way into the magnificent hall of the Great Council where this statue once stood, with the statues of many other Genoese heroes and statesmen, and I am not sure that it was worth all our trouble. Magnificent it certainly was, but coarsely magnificent, like so much elsewhere in Genoa; but, if we had been at ten times the trouble we were in seeing the Palace of the Municipality, I should not think it too much. There in the great hall are the monuments of those Genoese notables whose munificence their country wished to remember in the order of their generosity. I do not remember just what the maximum was, but the Doge or other leading citizen who gave, say, twenty-five thousand ducats to the state had a statue erected to him; one who gave fifteen, a bust; and one who gave five, an honorary tablet. The surprising thing is that nearly all the statues and busts, whether good likenesses or not, are delightful art: it is as if the noble acts of the benefactors of their country had inspired the sculptors to reproduce them not only in true character, but in due dignity. To the American who views them and remembers that we have now so much money that some of us do not know what to do with it, they will suggest that our millionaires have an unrivalled opportunity of immortality in the same sort. There is hardly a town of ten thousand inhabitants in the country where there are not men who could easily afford to give a hundred thousand dollars, or fifty, or twenty to their native or adoptive place and so enter upon a new life in bronze or marble. This would enrich us beyond the dreams of avarice in a high-grade portrait statuary; it would give work to hundreds of sculptors who now have little or nothing to do, and would revive or create the supplementary industries of casting in metal or carving in stone. The time was in Genoa, it seems, as the time is now with us, when a great many people did not know what to do with their money. There were sumptuary laws which forbade their spending it, either they or their wives or daughters, in dress; apparently they could not even wear Genoa velvet, which had to be sold abroad for the corruption of the outside world; and this is said to be the reason why there were so many palaces built in Genoa in the days of the republic. People who did not wish to figure in that hall of fame put their surplus into the immense and often ugly edifices which we still see ministering to their pride in the wide and narrow streets of the city. Now and then a devout family built or rebuilt a church and gave it to the public; but by far the greater number put up palaces, where, after the house-warming, they dwelt in a cold and economical seclusion. Some of their palaces are now devoted to public uses; they are galleries of pictures and statues most worthy to be seen, or they are municipal offices, or museums, or schools of art or science; but part are still in the keeping of the families that contributed them to the splendor of their city. The streets in which they stand are loud with transit and traffic, but the palaces hold aloof from the turmoil and lift their lofty heads to the level of the gardens behind them. Huge, heavy they are, according to the local ideal, and always wanting the delicacy of Venetian architecture, where something in the native genius tempered to gentleness the cold severity of Palladio, and where Sansovino knew how to bridge the gulf between the Gothic and the Renascent art that would have been Greek but halted at being Roman. The grandeur of those streets of palaces in Genoa cannot be denied, but perhaps, if the visitor quite consulted his preference or indulged his humor, he would wander rather through the arcades of the busy port, up the chasmal alleys of little shops into the tiny piazzas, no bigger than a good-sized room, opening before some ancient church and packed with busy, noisy people. The perspective there is often like the perspective in old Naples, but the uproar in Genoa does not break in music as it does in Naples, and the chill lingering in the sunless depths of those chasms is the cold of a winter that begins earlier and a spring that loiters later than the genial seasons of the South. \\n\\nX. EDEN AFTER THE FALL \\nA few years ago an Englishman who had lived our neighbor in the same villa at San Remo, came and said that he was going away because it was so dull at San Remo. He was going with his wife to Monte Carlo, because you could find amusement every day in the week at the tables of the different games of chance, and Sundays there was a very nice little English church. He did not seem to think there was anything out of the way in his grouping of these advantages, but he did not strongly urge them upon us, and we restricted ourselves in turn to our tacit reflections on the indifference of the English to a point of morals on which the American conscience is apt to suffer more or less anguish if it offends. So far as I know they do not think it wrong to take money won at any game; but possibly their depravity in this matter rather comforted us than offended. At any rate, I am sure of the superiority of our own morals in visiting Monte Carlo after we left Genoa. If we did not look forward with our Englishman's complacency to the nice little church there, we certainly did not mean to risk our money at the tables of Roulette, nor yet at the tables of Trente et Quarante, in the Casino. What we really wished to do was to look on in the spiritual security of saints while the sinners of both sexes lost and gained to the equal hurt of their souls. We perhaps expected to hear the report of a pistol in the gardens of the Casino, if we did not actually see the ruined gambler falling among the flowers, or if not so much as this, we thought we might witness his dramatic despair as the croupier drew in the last remnant of his fortune and mechanically invited the other Messieurs and Mesdames to make their game; secretly, we might even have been willing to see something hysterical on the part of the Mesdames if fate frowned upon them, or something scandalously exuberant if it smiled. If our motives were not the worst, they were, at any rate, not the best; I suppose they were the usual human motives, and I am afraid they were mixed. We found it rather long from Genoa to Monte Carlo, but this was not so much because of the distance as because of the delays of our train, which, having started late, grew reckless on the way, and before we reached the Italian frontier at Ventimiglia, had lost all shame and failed to connect there with the French train for the rest of our journey. So, instead of having barely time to affirm our innocence of tobacco, spirits, or perfumes to the customs officers, and to wash down a sandwich with a cup of coffee at the restaurant, we had an hour and forty minutes at Ventimiglia, which I partly spent in vain attempts to buy the poverty of the inspector so far as to prevail with him not to delay the examination of our baggage, but to proceed to it at once, in order that we might have it all off our minds, and devote our long leisure to the inquiry by what steps the ancient Ligurian tribe of the Intemelii lost their name in its actual corruption of Ventimiglia. It is a charming old town, far more charming than the stranger who never has time to walk into it from the station can imagine, and there is a palm-bordered avenue leading from the railway to the sea, with the shops and cafes of Italy on one side and the shops and cafes of France on the other. So late as six o'clock in the evening those cafes and shops preserved a reciprocal integrity which I could not praise too highly, but after dark there must be a ghostly interchange of forbidden commodities among them which no force of customs officers could wholly suppress. At any rate, I should have liked to see them try it, though I should not have liked to be kept in Ventimiglia overnight for any less reason; it seemed a lonesome place, though mighty picturesque, with old walls, and a magnificent old fort toward the sea, and a fine bridge spanning, though for the moment superfluously spanning, the perfectly dry bed of a river. I wished to ask what the name of the river was, but out of all the files of people coming and going I chose an aged man who could not tell me; he excused himself with real regret on the ground that he was a stranger in those parts. Then there was nothing for me to do but go back to the station and renew my attempt on the inspector, who still remained proof against me. What added to the hardship of the situation was that it was Italy at one end of the station and France at the other, and in one extremity it was an hour earlier than it was at the other, by the time of Central Europe at the east and by the time of Paris at the west, so that I do not know but we were two hours and forty minutes at Ventimiglia instead of one hour and forty minutes. Of this period little could be employed at tea, and we were not otherwise hungry; we could give something of our interminable leisure to counting our baggage and suffering unfounded alarms at failing to make it come out right, but we could not give much. The weather had turned chilly, the long station was full of draughts, and the invalid of the party, without whom no American party is perfectly national, was rapidly taking cold. We were quite incredulous when the examination actually began, but at last it really did, and it began with our pieces, with such a show of favoring us on the inspector's part, that when it was over, in about two minutes, one trunk serving as a type of the innocence of all, I furtively held up a piece of five francs in recognition of his kindness. But he slowly shook his head, whether in regret or whether in stern refusal I shall never know. He was an Italian, but in the employment of the French republic, and I have not been able since to credit with certainty his incorruptibility to his native or his adoptive country; I might easily be mistaken in deciding either way. What I am certain of, and certainly sorry for, is the superiority of the French company's railway carriage, from Ventimiglia on, to the Italian carriage which had brought us so far, and it is still with unwillingness that I own the corporation's greater care for our comfort. If we had been in the paternal care of the administration of the gambling-house. at Monte Carlo, we could not have been more tenderly or cleanly cushioned about, or borne away on softer springs; and very possibly a measure of wickedness in the means is a condition of comfort in the end to which we are so tempted to abandon ourselves in a world which is not yet so sternly collectivist as I could wish. It was not quite dark when we arrived at Monte Carlo and began to experience, in the beautiful keeping of the place, how admirably a gambling-house can manage the affairs of a principality when it pays all the taxes. There were many two-horse landaus waiting our pleasure outside the station, and the horses were all so robust and handsome that we were not put to our usual painful endeavor in seeking the best and getting the worst. All those stately equipages were good, and the one that fell to us mounted the hill to our hotel by a grade so insinuating that the balkiest horse in Frascati could hardly have suspected it. In our easy ascent we were aware of the gray-and-blond houses behind their walls among their groves and gardens, among flowers and blossoms; of the varying inclines and levels from which some lovely difference of prospect appeared at every step; of the admirably tended roadways, and the walks that followed them up hill and down, and crossed to little parks, or led to streets brilliant with shops and hotels, clustering about the great gambling-house, the centre of the common prosperity and animation. The air had softened with the setting sun, and the weather which had at Leghorn and Genoa delayed through two weeks of rain and cold, seemed to confess the control of the Casino administration, as everything else does at Monte Carlo, and promised an amiability to which we eagerly trusted. \\nIt was of course warmer out-doors than in-doors, and while the fire was kindling on our hearth we gave the quarter hour before dinner to looking over our garden-wall into the comely town in the valley below, and to the palace and capital of the Prince of Monaco on the heights beyond. Nothing by day or by night could be more exquisite than the little harbor, a perfect horseshoe in shape, and now, at our first sight of it, set round with electric lights, like diamonds in the scarf-pin of some sporty Titan, or perhaps of Hercules Monoecus himself, who is said to have founded Monaco. In the morning we saw that the waters arranged themselves in the rainbow colors of such a scarf round the shores, and that there were only pleasure-craft moored in them: the yacht of the Prince of Monaco and the yacht of some American Prince, whose title I did not ascertain, but whose flag was unmistakable. There must have been other yachts, but I do not remember them, and possibly there were some workaday craft, of which I do not now recall the impression; but I am certain of the festive air of disoccupation pervading the port from the adjacent towns, both Monte Carlo and Monaco, which its wicked suburb has cleansed in corrupting, and rendered attractive by the example of its elegant leisure. There remains from both places, and from Condamine in the plain between them the sense of a perpetual round of holidays. There seemed to be no more creative business in one place than another, but I do not say there is none; there is certainly a polite distillery of perfumes and liqueurs in Condamine, but what one sees is the commerce of the shops, and the building up of more and more villas and hotels, on every shelf and ledge, to harden and whiten in the sun, and let their gardens hang over the verges of the cliffs. On the northeast, the mountains rise into magnificent steeps whose names would say nothing to the reader, except that of Turbia, which he will recall as the classic Tropaea of Augustus, who marked there the bounds between Italy and Gaul. But we were as yet in no mood to climb this height, even with the help of a funicular railway, and I made my explorations at such convenient elevations as I could reach on foot, or by the help of one of those luxurious landaus peculiar to Monte Carlo. One such point was undoubtedly the headland of Monaco, where the Greeks of Marseilles, long enough before Augustus, built a temple to Hercules Monoecus. The Grimaldi family which gave Genoa many doges, came early into the sovereignty of Monaco, by the hook or crook those days, but whether it was they who fostered its piracy in the fourteenth century, does not distinctly appear, though it seems certain that one of the Grimaldi princes served against the English under Philip of Valois, and was wounded at Crecy. In 1524 a successor went over to the empire under Charles V. Still later the principality returned to the sovereignty of France, and in 1793 the French republicans frankly annexed it, but it was given back to the Grimaldi in 1814. The Grimaldi on the whole were a baddish line of potentates, and only lacked largeness of scene to have left the memory of world-tragedies. They murdered one another, at least in two cases; in another, the people killed their ruler by publicly drowning him in the sea for insulting their women; the princes were the protectors of piracy, and in the very late times following their restoration by the Congress of Vienna, the reigning prince confiscated the property of the churches for his own behoof, and took into his hands the whole trade of the principality. He alone bought and ground the grain, and baked the bread, which he sold to his people at an extortionate price; he bought damaged flour in Genoa and fed it to his subjects at the same rate as good. When they murmured and threatened rebellion, he threatened in turn that he would rule them with a rod of iron, as if their actual conditions were not bad enough. Some of his oppressions were of a fantasticality bordering on comic opera: travellers had to give up their provisions at the frontier and eat the official bread of Monaco; ships entering the port were confiscated if they had brought more loaves than sufficed them for their voyage thither; no man might cut his own wood without leave of the police, or prune his trees, or till his land, or irrigate it; the birth and death of every animal must be publicly registered, with the payment of a given tax, and nobody could go out after ten at night without carrying a taxed lantern. When Nice was annexed to France in 1860 Monaco passed under French protection again, and now it is subject to conscription like the rest of France. Ten years after the beginning of this new order of things the great M. Blanc was expelled from Hombourg, and the Prince of Monaco rented to him the-gambling privilege of Monte Carlo. Then the modern splendor of the place began. The entire population of the three towns, Monaco, Monte Carlo, and Condamine, is not above fifteen thousand, and apparently the greater part of the inhabitants depend upon the gay industry of the Casino for their livelihood. I should say that the most of the houses in Monte Carlo were hotels, or pensions, or furnished villas, or furnished apartments, and if one could be content to live in the atmosphere of the Casino, which is not meteorologically lurid, I do not know where one could live in greater comfort. It is said that everything is rather dearer than in Nice, for instance, but such things as I wanted to buy I did not find very dear. The rates at the most expensive hotels did not seem exhorbitant when reduced to dollars, and if you went a little way from the Casino the hotels were very reasonable, so that you could spend a great deal of money at the tables which in America you would spend in board and lodging. I fancy that a villa could be got there very reasonably, and as the morals of all the inhabitants are scrupulously cared for by the administration of the Casino, and no one living in the principality is allowed to frequent the gaming-tables, it is probable that domestic service is good and cheap. If I may speak from our experience at our very simple little hotel, it is admirable, one waiter sufficing for ten or twelve guests, with leisure for much friendly conversation in the office, between the breakfasts served in our rooms and the excellent dinners at the small tables in the salon. If you liked, he would speak French or Italian, though he spoke English as well as any one, and he was of that excellent Piedmontese race which has been the saving salt of the whole peninsula. As for the food, it was far beyond that of our cold-storage, and it must have been cheap, since it was provided for us at the rate we paid. The cost of dress varies, according to the taste of and the purse, everywhere. White serge seemed the favorite wear of most of the ladies one saw in the street at Monte Carlo, especially in the region of the Casino. This may have expressed an inner condition, or it may have been a sympathetic response to the advances of the flowers in the pretty beds and parterres so fancifully designed by the gardeners of the administration, or it may have been a token of the helpless submission to which the windows of the milliners and modistes reduced all comers of the dressful sex. Many of the men with the women, or without them, were also in white serge, but they seemed more variably attired; there was a prevailing suggestion of yachting or automobiling in their dress, though doubtless most of them had not sailed or motored to the spot. Some few, say four or five, may have motored away from it, for in the centre of the charming square before the Casino there was an automobile of some newest type being raffled for in the interest of that chiefest of the Christian virtues which makes its most successful appeals in the vicinity of games of chance. Some one must have won the machine and carried a party of his friends away, and triumphantly turned turtle with it over the first of the precipices which abound at Monte Carlo. More than the tables within this opportunity of fortune tempted me, and it was only by the repeated recurrence to my principles that I was able to get away alive. In spite of myself, I did not get away without, however guiltlessly, having yielded to the spirit of the place. It was at the Administrational Art Exhibition, where there were really some good pictures, and where, on my entering, I was given a small brass disk. On going out I attempted to restore this to the door-keeper, but he went back with me to a certain piece of mechanism, where he instructed me to put the disk into a slot. Then the disk ran its course, and a small brass ball came out at the bottom. The door-keeper opened this, and showed me that it was empty; but he gave me to understand that it might have been full of diamonds, or rubies, or seed-pearls, which might have implanted in me a lust of gambling I should never have overcome. Monte Carlo was in every way tempting. A vast oblong, brilliant with flowers in artistic patterns, stretched upward from the Casino, and there was an agreeable park where one might sit. On every other side there were costly hotels and costly restaurants, including that of the unexampled, the insurpassable Giro, where one saw people eating and drinking at the windows whenever one passed, by day or night. Beyond the Casino seaward were the beautiful terraces, planted with palms and other tropic growths, where people might come out and kill themselves when they had nothing left to lose but their lives; and against the dark green of their fronds the temple of fortune lifted a frosted-cake-like front of long extent. I do not know just what type of architecture it is of, but it distinctly suggests the art of the pastry cook when he has triumphed in some edifice crowning the centre of the table at a great public dinner. What mars the pleasing effect most is a detail which enforces this suggestion, for the region of the Casino is thickly frequented by a species of black doves, and when these gather in close lines of black dots along the eaves, they have exactly the effect of flies clustering on the sugary surfaces of the cake. At intervals are bronze statues of what seem a sort of adolescent cherubs, but which have, I do not know why, a peculiarly devilish appearance. No doubt they are harmless enough; but certainly they do nothing to keep the flies off the cake. In fine, as an edifice the Casino disappoints, and if one is not pressingly curious about the interior, one rather lingers on the terrace overlooking the sea, and the lines of the railroad following the shore, and the panorama of the several towns. It is charming to sit there, and if it is in the afternoon, you may see an artist there painting water-colors of the scenery. Even if he were not painting, you could not help knowing him for an artist, because he wears a black velvet jacket and knickerbockers, and a soft slouch hat, and has a curled black mustache and pointed beard; there is no mistaking him; and at a given moment, after he has been working long enough, he puts above his sketch the sign, \\\"For Sale,\\\" as artists always do, and then, if you want a masterpiece, you go down a few steps from where you are sitting and buy it. But I never did that any more than I took tickets for the charity automobile, though there is no telling what I might not have done if I had broken the bank when at last I went into the Casino. It seems to open about eleven o'clock in the morning, for gamblers are hard-working, impatient people, and do not want to lose time. A broad stretch of red carpet is laid down the steps from the portal and they begin to go in at once, and people keep going in until I know not what hour at night. But I think mid-afternoon is the best hour to see them, and it is then that I will invite the reader to accompany me, instructing him to turn to the left on entering, and get his gratis billet of admission to the rooms from the polite officials there in charge, who will ask for his card, and inquire his country and city, but will not insist upon his street and his number in it. This form is apparently to make sure that you are not a resident of the principality, and that if you suffer in your morals from your visit to the Casino you shall not be a source of local corruption thereafter. They bow you away, first audibly pronouncing your name with polyglottic accuracy, and then you are free to wander where you like. But probably you will want to go at once from the large, nobly colonnaded reception-hall or atrium, into that series of salons where wickeder visitors than yourself are already closely seated at the oblong tables, and standing one or two deep round them. The salons of the series are four, and the tables in each are from two to five, according to the demands of the season; some are Trente et Quarante-tables, and some, by far the greater number, are Roulette-tables. Roulette seems the simpler game, and the more popular; I formed the notion that there was a sort of aristocratic quality in Trente et Quarante, and that the players of that game were of higher rank and longer purse, but I can allege no reason justifying my notion. All that I can say is that the tables devoted to it commanded the seaward views, and the tops of the gardens where the players withdrew when they wished to commit suicide. The rooms are decorated by several French painters of note, and the whole interior is designed by the famous architect Gamier, to as little effect of beauty as could well be. It is as if these French artists had worked in the German taste, rather than their own, and in any case they have achieved in their several allegories and impersonations something uniformly heavy and dull. One might fancy that the mood of the players at the tables had imparted itself to the figures in the panels, but very likely this is not so, for the players had apparently parted with none of their unpleasing dulness. They were in about equal number men and women, and they partook equally of a look of hard repression. The repression may not have been wholly from within; a little away from each table hovered, with an air of detachment, certain plain and quiet men, who, for all their apparent inattention, may have been agents of the Administration vigilant to subdue the slightest show of drama in the players. I myself saw no drama, unless I may call so the attitude of a certain tall, handsome young man, who stood at the corner of one of the tables, and, with nervously working jaws, staked his money at each invitation of the croupiers. I did not know whether he won or lost, and I could not decide from their faces which of the other men or women were winning or losing. I had supposed that I might see distinguished faces, distinguished figures, but I saw none. The players were of the average of the spectators in dress and carriage, but in the heavy atmosphere of the rooms, which was very hot and very bad, they all alike looked dull. At a psychological moment it suddenly came to me in their presence, that if there was such a place as hell, it must be very dull, like that, and that the finest misery of perdition must be the stupid dulness of it. For some unascertained reason, but probably from a mistaken purpose of ornament, there hung over the centre of each table, almost down to the level of the players' heads, lengths of large-linked chains, and it was imaginable, though not very probable, that if any of the lost souls rose violently up, or made an unseemly outcry, or other rebellious demonstration, those plain, quiet men, the agents of the Administration, would fling themselves upon him or her, and bind them with those chains, and cast them into such outer darkness as could be symbolized by the shade of the terrace trees. The thing was improbable, as I say, but not impossible, if there is truth in Swedenborg's relation that the hells are vigilantly policed, and from time to time put in order by angels detailed for that office. To be sure the plain, quiet men did not look like angels, and the Administration of which they were agents, could not, except in its love of order, be likened to any celestial authority. Commonly in the afternoon there is music in the great atrium from which the gambling-rooms open, and then there is a pleasant movement of people up and down. They are kept in motion perhaps by their preference, somewhat, but also largely by the want of seats. If you can secure one of these you may amuse yourself very well by looking on at the fashion and beauty of those who have not secured any. Here you will see much more distinction than in the gambling-rooms; the air is better, and if you choose to fancy this the limbo of that inferno, it will not be by a violent strain. In the crowd will be many pretty young girls, in proper chaperonage, and dressed in the latest effects of Paris; if they happen to be wearing the mob-cap hats of the moment it is your greater gain; they could not be so charming in anything else, or look more innocent, or more consciously innocent. You could only hope, however, such were the malign associations of the place, that their chaperons would not neglect them for the gaming-tables beyond, but you could not be sure, if the chaperons were all like that old English lady one evening at the opera in the Casino, who came in charge of her niece, or possibly some friend's daughter. She remained dutifully enough beside the girl through the first act of the stupid musical comedy, and even through the ensuing ballet, and when a flaunting female, in a hat of cart-wheel circumference, came in and shut out the whole stage from the hapless stranger behind, this good old lady authorized her charge to ask him to take the seat next them where he could see something of the action if he wished. But at the end of the ballet, she rose, and bidding the girl wait her return, she vanished in the direction of the gaming-rooms. She may merely have gone to look on at a spectacle which, dulness for dulness, was no worse than that of the musical comedy, and I have no proof that she risked her money there. The girl sat through the next act, and then in a sudden fine alarm, like that of a bird which, from no visible cause, starts from its perch, she took flight, and I hope she found her aunt, or her mother's friend, quietly sleeping on one of those seats in the atrium. It was one of those tacit, eventless dramas which in travel are always offering themselves to your witness. They begin in silence, and go quietly on to their unfinish, and leave you steeped in an interest which is life-long, whereas a story whose end you know soon perishes from your mind. Art has not yet learned the supreme lesson of life, which is never a tale that is told within the knowledge of the living. Nowhere, I think, is the \\\"sweet security of streets\\\" felt more than in Monte Carlo. Whether the control of that good Administration of the Casino reaches to the policing of the place in other respects or not, I cannot say, but one walks home at night from the theatre of the Casino with the same sense of safety that one enjoys under that paternal roof. At eleven o'clock all Monte Carlo sleeps the sleep of the innocent and the just in the dwellings of the citizens and permanent residents; though it cannot be denied that there appear to be late suppers in the hotels and restaurants surrounding the Casino, which the iniquitous may be giving to the guilty. Away from the flare of their bold lights the town reposes in a demi-dark, and presents to the more strenuous fancy the effect of a mezzotint study of itself; by day it is a group of wash-drawings near to, and farther off, of water-colors, very richly and broadly treated. I could not insist too much upon this notion with the reader who has never been there, or has not received picture postal-cards from sojourning correspondents. These would afford him a portrait of the chief features and characteristics of the place not too highly flattered, for in fact it would be impossible for even a picture postal-card to exaggerate its beauty. They will besides convey one of the few convincing proofs that in spite of the Blanc Casino and the French Republic the Prince of Monaco is still a reigning sovereign, for the postage-stamps bear the tastefully printed head of that potentate. If the visitor requires other proofs he may take a landau at the station in Monaco, and drive up over the heights of the capital into the piazza before the prince's palace. When the prince is not at home he can readily get leave to visit the palace for twenty minutes, but on my unlucky day the prince was doubly at home, for he was sick as well as in residence. I satisfied myself as well as I could, and I am very easy to satisfy, with my drive through the pleasant town, which is entirely Italian in effect, with its people standing about or looking out of their windows in their Sunday leisure, and quite Roman in the cleanliness of its streets. I took due pleasure in the unfinished exterior of the Oceanographic Museum and the newly finished interior of the Monaco Cathedral. The cathedral, which is so new as to make one rejoice that most other cathedrals are old, is of a glaring freshness, but is very handsome; somehow in spite of its newness it contains the tombs of the reigning family, and perhaps it has only been newly done over. The museum which is ultimately to be the greatest of its kind in the world, already contains somewhere in its raw inaccessible recesses the collections made by Prince Albert in his many cruises, and is of a palatiality worthy of a sovereign with a tenant so generous and prompt in its rent as the Administration of the Casino of Monte Carlo. \\nThis fact, namely, that the princely grandeur and splendor of Monaco all came out of the gaming-tables, was something that the driver of my landau made me observe, when our intimacy had mounted with our road, and we paused for the magnificent view of the sea from the headland near the museum. He was otherwise a shrewd and conversible Piedmontese who did not make me pay much above the tariff, and who had pity on my poor French after awhile, and consented to speak Italian with me. In the sort of French glare over the whole local civilization of the principality, everybody will wish to seem French, but after you break through the surface, the natives will be as comfortably and endearingly Italian as anybody in the peninsula. Among themselves they speak a Ligurian patois, but with the stranger they will use an Italian easily much better than his, and also much better than their own French. I think they prefer you in their racial parlance after you have shown some knowledge of it, and two kind women of whom I asked my way in Monte Carlo, one day when I was trying for the station of the funicular to Turbia, grew more volubly kind when I asked it in such Tuscan as I could command. That station is really not hard to find when once you know where it is, and at three o'clock in the afternoon I was mounting the precipitous incline of the alp on whose summit Augustus divided Italy from Gaul, and left the stupendous trophy which one sees there in ruins to-day. I should like to render the sense of my upward progress dramatic by pretending that we mounted from a zone of flowers at Monte Carlo into regions where only the hardiest blossoms greeted us, but what I really noticed was that by-and-by the little patches of vineyard seemed to grow less and the olive-trees scraggier. Perhaps even this was partly fancy; as for the flowers, I cannot bring myself to partake of their deceit; for they are the most shameless fakers, as regards climate, in nature. It is, for instance, perfectly true that they are in bloom along the Riviera all winter long, but this does not prove that the winter of the Riviera is always warm. It merely proves that flowers can stand a degree of cold that nips the nose bent to hale their perfume, and brings tears into the eyes dwelling in rapture on their loveliness. They are like women; they look so fragile and delicate that you think they cannot stand anything, but they can stand pretty much everything, or at least everything they wish to. Throughout that week at Monte Carlo, while we cowered round our fires or went out into a frigid sunshine, the flowers smiled from every garden-ground in a gayety emulous of that of their sisters passing in white serge. So probably I gave less attention to the details of the scenery through which my funicular was passing than to the stupendous prospects of sea and shore which it varyingly commanded. If words could paint these I should not spare the words, but when I recall them, my richest treasure of adjectives seems a beggarly array of color tubes, flattened and twisted past all col-lapsibility. Nothing less than an old-fashioned panoramic show would impart any notion of it, and even that must fail where it should most abound, namely, in the delicacy of that ineffable majesty. We climbed and climbed, with many a muted hope and many a muted fear of the mechanism which carried us so safely, and then we ran across a stretch of comparative level and reached the last station, under the cliff on which the local hotel stood, with the mighty ruin behind it. Our passengers flocked up to the terrace of the hotel, much shoved and shouldered by automobiles bearing the company which seems proper to those vehicles, and dispersed themselves at the many little tables set about for tea, and the glory of the matchless outlook. While one could yet have the ruin mostly to one's self, it seemed the most favorable moment to visit the crumbling walls and broken tower, whose fragments strewed the slopes around. The tower was of Augustus, and the fortress into which it was turned in the Middle Ages was of unknown authority, but the ruin was the work of Marshal Villars, who blew up both trophy and stronghold sometime in the French king's wars with the imperialists in the first half of the eighteenth century. The destruction was incomplete, though probably sufficient for the purpose, but as a ruin, nothing could be more admirable. There seems to be at present something like a restoration going on; it has not gone very far, however; it has developed some fragments of majestic pillars, and some breadths of Roman brick-work; a few spaces about the base of the tower are cleared; but the rehabilitation will probably never proceed to such an extreme that you may not sit down on some carven remnant of the past, and closing your eyes to the surrounding glory of alp and sea find yourself again on the Palatine or amid the memorials of the Forum. \\n\\nTHE END\\n\",\n          \"Title: A Wanderer in Florence\\nAuthor: E.

Let us do the same.\\n\\nThe real name of the Duomo is the Cathedral of S. Maria del Fiore, or\\nSt. Mary of the Flowers, the flower being the Florentine lily. Florence\\nherself is called the City of Flowers, and that, in the spring and\\nsummer, is a happy enough description. But in the winter it fails. A\\nname appropriate to all the seasons would be the City of the Miracle,\\nthe miracle being the Renaissance. For though all over Italy traces\\nof the miracle are apparent, Florence was its very home and still\\ncan point to the greatest number of its achievements. Giotto (at the\\nbeginning of this quickening movement) may at Assisi have been more\\ninspired as a painter; but here is his campanile and here are his\\nS. Maria Novella and S. Croce frescoes. Fra Angelico and Donatello\\n(in the midst of it) were never more inspired than here, where they\\nworked and died. Michelangelo (at the end of it) may be more surprising\\nin the Vatican; but here are his wonderful Medici tombs. How it came\\nabout that between the years 1300 and 1500 Italian soil -- and chiefly\\nTuscan soil -- threw up such masters, not only with the will and spirit\\nto do what they did but with the power too, no one will ever be able\\nto explain. But there it is. In the history of the world two centuries\\nwere suddenly given mysteriously to the activities of Italian men of\\nhumane genius and as suddenly the Divine gift was withdrawn. And to see\\nthe very flower of these two centuries it is to Florence we must go.\\n\\nIt is best to enter the Piazza del Duomo from the Via de' Martelli,\\nthe Via de' Cerretani, the Via Calzaioli, or the Via Pecori, because\\nthen one comes instantly upon the campanile too. The upper windows -- so\\nvery lovely -- may have been visible at the end of the streets, with\\nBrunelleschi's warm dome high in the sky beside them, but that was\\nnot to diminish the effect of the first sight of the whole. Duomo and\\ncampanile make as fair a couple as ever builders brought together: the\\nimmense comfortable church so solidly set upon the earth, and at its\\nside this delicate, slender marble creature, all gaiety and lightness,\\nwhich as surely springs from roots within the earth. For one cannot\\nbe long in Florence, looking at this tower every day and many times a\\nday, both from near and far, without being perfectly certain that it\\ngrows -- and from a bulb, I think -- and was never really built at all,\\nwhatever the records may aver.\\n\\nThe interior of the Duomo is so unexpected that one has the\\nfeeling of having entered, by some extraordinary chance, the wrong\\nbuilding. Outside it was so garish with its coloured marbles, under\\nthe southern sky; outside, too, one's ears were filled with all the\\nshattering noises in which Florence is an adept; and then, one step,\\nand behold nothing but vast and silent gloom. This surprise is the more\\nemphatic if one happens already to have been in the Baptistery. For the\\nBaptistery is also coloured marble without, yet within it is coloured\\nmarble and mosaic too: there is no disparity; whereas in the Duomo\\nthe walls have a Northern grey and the columns are brown. Austerity\\nand immensity join forces.\\n\\nWhen all is said the chief merit of the Duomo is this immensity. Such\\nworks of art as it has are not very noticeable, or at any rate do\\nnot insist upon being seen; but in its vastness it overpowers. Great\\nas are some of the churches of Florence, I suppose three or four of\\nthem could be packed within this one. And mere size with a dim light\\nand a savour of incense is enough: it carries religion. No need for\\nmasses and chants or any ceremony whatever: the world is shut out,\\none is on terms with the infinite. A forest exercises the same spell;\\namong mountains one feels it; but in such a cathedral as the Duomo one\\nfeels it perhaps most of all, for it is the work of man, yet touched\\nwith mystery and wonder, and the knowledge that man is the author of\\nsuch a marvel adds to its greatness.\\n\\nThe interior is so dim and strange as to be for a time sheer terra\\nincognita, and to see a bat flitting from side to side, as I have\\noften done even in the morning, is to receive no shock. In such a\\ntwilight land there must naturally be bats, one thinks. The darkness\\nis due not to lack of windows but to time. The windows are there,\\nbut they have become opaque. None of the coloured ones in the aisle\\nallows more than a filtration of light through it; there are only the\\nplain, circular ones high up and those rich, coloured, circular ones\\nunder the dome to do the work. In a little while, however, one's eyes\\nnot only become accustomed to the twilight but are very grateful for\\nit; and beginning to look inquiringly about, as they ever do in this\\ncity of beauty, they observe, just inside, an instant reminder of the\\nantiseptic qualities of Italy. For by the first great pillar stands a\\nreceptacle for holy water, with a pretty and charming angelic figure\\nupon it, which from its air of newness you would think was a recent\\ngift to the cathedral by a grateful Florentine. It is six hundred\\nyears old and perhaps was designed by Giotto himself.\\n\\nThe emptiness of the Duomo is another of its charms. Nothing is allowed\\nto impair the vista as you stand by the western entrance: the floor\\nhas no chairs; the great columns rise from it in the gloom as if they,\\ntoo, were rooted. The walls, too, are bare, save for a few tablets.\\n\\nThe history of the building is briefly this. The first cathedral of\\nFlorence was the Baptistery, and S. John the Baptist is still the\\npatron saint of the city. Then in 1182 the cathedral was transferred\\nto S. Reparata, which stood on part of the site of the Duomo, and in\\n1294 the decision to rebuild S. Reparata magnificently was arrived\\nat, and Arnolfo di Cambio was instructed to draw up plans. Arnolfo,\\nwhom we see not only on a tablet in the left aisle, in relief, with\\nhis plan, but also more than life size, seated beside Brunelleschi\\non the Palazzo de' Canonici on the south side of the cathedral,\\nfacing the door, was then sixty-two and an architect of great\\nreputation. Born in 1232, he had studied under Niccolo Pisano, the\\nsculptor of the famous pulpit at Pisa (now in the museum there),\\nof that in the cathedral in Siena, and of the fountain at Perugia\\n(in all of which Arnolfo probably helped), and the designer of many\\nbuildings all over Italy. Arnolfo's own unaided sculpture may be seen\\nat its best in the ciborium in S. Paolo Fuori le Mura in Rome; but\\nit is chiefly as an architect that he is now known. He had already\\ngiven Florence her extended walls and some of her most beautiful\\nbuildings -- the Or San Michele and the Badia -- and simultaneously he\\ndesigned S. Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio. Vasari has it that Arnolfo\\nwas assisted on the Duomo by Cimabue; but that is doubtful.\\n\\nThe foundations were consecrated in 1296 and the first stone laid\\non September 8th, 1298, and no one was more interested in its early\\nprogress than a young, grave lawyer who used to sit on a stone seat\\non the south side and watch the builders, little thinking how soon\\nhe was to be driven from Florence for ever. This seat -- the Sasso di\\nDante -- was still to be seen when Wordsworth visited Florence in 1837,\\nfor he wrote a sonnet in which he tells us that he in reverence sate\\nthere too, \\\"and, for a moment, filled that empty Throne\\\". But one\\ncan do so no longer, for the place which it occupied has been built\\nover and only a slab in the wall with an inscription (on the house\\nnext the Palazzo de' Canonici) marks the site.\\n\\nArnolfo died in 1310, and thereupon there seems to have been a\\ncessation or slackening of work, due no doubt to the disturbed\\nstate of the city, which was in the throes of costly wars and\\nembroilments. Not until 1332 is there definite news of its progress,\\nby which time the work had passed into the control of the Arte della\\nLana; but in that year, although Florentine affairs were by no means\\nas flourishing as they should be, and a flood in the Arno had just\\ndestroyed three or four of the bridges, a new architect was appointed,\\nin the person of the most various and creative man in the history\\nof the Renaissance -- none other than Giotto himself, who had already\\nreceived the commission to design the campanile which should stand\\nat the cathedral's side.\\n\\nGiotto was the son of a small farmer at Vespignano, near Florence. He\\nwas instructed in art by Cimabue, who discovered him drawing a lamb\\non a stone while herding sheep, and took him as his pupil. Cimabue,\\nof whom more is said, together with more of Giotto as a painter, in the\\nchapter on the Accademia, had died in 1302, leaving Giotto far beyond\\nall living artists, and Giotto, between the age of fifty and sixty, was\\nnow residing in Cimabue's house. He had already painted frescoes in the\\nBargello (introducing his friend Dante), in S. Maria Novella, S. Croce,\\nand elsewhere in Italy, particularly in the upper and lower churches\\nat Assisi, and at the Madonna dell' Arena chapel at Padua when Dante\\nwas staying there during his exile. In those days no man was painter\\nonly or architect only; an all-round knowledge of both arts and crafts\\nwas desired by every ambitious youth who was attracted by the wish to\\nmake beautiful things, and Giotto was a universal master. It was not\\nthen surprising that on his settling finally in Florence he should be\\ninvited to design a campanile to stand for ever beside the cathedral,\\nor that he should be appointed superintendent of the cathedral works.\\n\\nGiotto did not live to see even his tower completed -- it is the unhappy\\ndestiny of architects to die too soon -- but he was able during the\\nfour years left him to find time for certain accessory decorations,\\nof which more will be said later, and also to paint for S. Trinit\\u00e0\\nthe picture which we shall see in the Accademia, together with a few\\nother works, since perished, for the Badia and S. Giorgio. He died in\\n1336 and was buried in the cathedral, as the tablet, with Benedetto\\nda Maiano's bust of him, tells. He is also to be seen full length,\\nin stone, in a niche at the Uffizi; but the figure is misleading,\\nfor if Vasari is to be trusted (and for my part I find it amusing to\\ntrust him as much as possible) the master was insignificant in size.\\n\\nGiotto has suffered, I think, in reputation, from Ruskin, who took\\nhim peculiarly under his wing, persistently called him \\\"the Shepherd,\\\"\\nand made him appear as something between a Sunday-school superintendent\\nand the Creator. The \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" and \\\"Giotto and his Works\\nin Padua\\\" so insist upon the artist's holiness and conscious purpose\\nin all he did that his genial worldliness, shrewdness, and humour, as\\nbrought out by Dante, Vasari, Sacchetti, and Boccaccio, are utterly\\nexcluded. What we see is an intense saint where really was a very\\nrobust man. Sacchetti's story of Giotto one day stumbling over a\\npig that ran between his legs and remarking, \\\"And serve me right;\\nfor I've made thousands with the help of pigs' bristles and never\\nonce given them even a cup of broth,\\\" helps to adjust the balance;\\nwhile to his friend Dante he made a reply, so witty that the poet\\ncould not forget his admiration, in answer to his question how was\\nit that Giotto's pictures were so beautiful and his six children so\\nugly; but I must leave the reader to hunt it for himself, as these\\nare modest pages. Better still, for its dry humour, was his answer\\nto King Robert of Naples, who had commanded him to that city to paint\\nsome Scriptural scenes, and, visiting the artist while he worked, on\\na very hot day, remarked, \\\"Giotto, if I were you I should leave off\\npainting for a while\\\". \\\"Yes,\\\" replied Giotto, \\\"if I were you I should.\\\"\\n\\nTo Giotto happily we come again and again in this book. Enough at\\npresent to say that upon his death in 1336 he was buried, like Arnolfo,\\nin the cathedral, where the tablet to his memory may be studied,\\nand was succeeded as architect, both of the church and the tower,\\nby his friend and assistant, Andrea Pisano, whose chief title to\\nfame is his Baptistery doors and the carving, which we are soon to\\nexamine, of the scenes round the base of the campanile. He, too,\\ndied -- in 1348 -- before the tower was finished.\\n\\nFrancesco Talenti was next called in, again to superintend both\\nbuildings, and not only to superintend but to extend the plans of the\\ncathedral. Arnolfo and Giotto had both worked upon a smaller scale;\\nTalenti determined the present floor dimensions. The revised fa\\u00e7ade\\nwas the work of a committee of artists, among them Giotto's godson\\nand disciple, Taddeo Gaddi, then busy with the Ponte Vecchio, and\\nAndrea Orcagna, whose tabernacle we shall see at Or San Michele. And\\nso the work went on until the main structure was complete in the\\nthirteen-seventies.\\n\\nAnother longish interval then came, in which nothing of note in the\\nconstruction occurred, and the next interesting date is 1418, when a\\ncompetition for the design for the dome was announced, the work to\\nbe given eventually to one Filippo Brunelleschi, then an ambitious\\nand nervously determined man, well known in Florence as an architect,\\nof forty-one. Brunelleschi, who, again according to Vasari, was small,\\nand therefore as different as may be from the figure which is seated\\non the clergy house opposite the south door of the cathedral, watching\\nhis handiwork, was born in 1377, the son of a well-to-do Florentine of\\ngood family who wished to make him a notary. The boy, however, wanted\\nto be an artist, and was therefore placed with a goldsmith, which was\\nin those days the natural course. As a youth he attempted everything,\\nbeing of a pertinacious and inquiring mind, and he was also a great\\ndebater and student of Dante; and, taking to sculpture, he was one\\nof those who, as we shall see in a later chapter, competed for the\\ncommission for the Baptistery gates. It was indeed his failure in that\\ncompetition which decided him to concentrate on architecture. That\\nhe was a fine sculptor his competitive design, now preserved in the\\nBargello, and his Christ crucified in S. Maria Novella, prove; but\\nin leading him to architecture the stars undoubtedly did rightly.\\n\\nIt was in 1403 that the decision giving Ghiberti the Baptistery\\ncommission was made, when Brunelleschi was twenty-six and Donatello,\\ndestined to be his life-long friend, was seventeen; and when\\nBrunelleschi decided to go to Rome for the study of his new branch of\\nindustry, architecture, Donatello went too. There they worked together,\\ncopying and measuring everything of beauty, Brunelleschi having always\\nbefore his mind the problem of how to place a dome upon the cathedral\\nof his native city. But, having a shrewd knowledge of human nature\\nand immense patience, he did not hasten to urge upon the authorities\\nhis claims as the heaven-born architect, but contented himself with\\nsmaller works, and even assisted his rival Ghiberti with his gates,\\njoining at that task Donatello and Luca della Robbia, and giving\\nlessons in perspective to a youth who was to do more than any man\\nafter Giotto to assure the great days of painting and become the\\nexemplar of the finest masters -- Masaccio.\\n\\nIt was not until 1419 that Brunelleschi's persistence and belief\\nin his own powers satisfied the controllers of the cathedral works\\nthat he might perhaps be as good as his word and was the right man\\nto build the dome; but at last he was able to begin. For the\\nstory of his difficulties, told minutely and probably with sufficient\\naccuracy, one must go to Vasari: it is well worth reading, and is a\\nlurid commentary on the suspicions and jealousies of the world. The\\nbuilding of the dome, without scaffolding, occupied fourteen years,\\nBrunelleschi's device embracing two domes, one within the other,\\ntied together with stone for material support and strength. It is\\nbecause of this inner dome that the impression of its size, from\\nwithin the cathedral, can disappoint. Meanwhile, in spite of all the\\nwear and tear of the work, the satisfying of incredulous busy-bodies,\\nand the removal of such an incubus as Ghiberti, who because he was a\\nsuperb modeller of bronze reliefs was made for a while joint architect\\nwith a salary that Brunelleschi felt should either be his own or no\\none's, the little man found time also to build beautiful churches\\nand cloisters all over Florence. He lived to see his dome finished\\nand the cathedral consecrated by Pope Eugenius IV in 1436, dying ten\\nyears later. He was buried in the cathedral, and his adopted son and\\npupil, Buggiano, made the head of him on the tablet to his memory.\\n\\nBrunelleschi's lantern, the model of which from his own hand we shall\\nsee in the museum of the cathedral, was not placed on the dome until\\n1462. The copper ball above it was the work of Verrocchio. In 1912\\nthere are still wanting many yards of stone border to the dome.\\n\\nOf the man himself we know little, except that he was of iron\\ntenacity and lived for his work. Vasari calls him witty, but gives\\na not good example of his wit; he seems to have been philanthropic\\nand a patron of poor artists, and he grieved deeply at the untimely\\ndeath of Masaccio, who painted him in one of the Carmine frescoes,\\ntogether with Donatello and other Florentines.\\n\\nAs one walks about Florence, visiting this church and that, and\\npeering into cool cloisters, one's mind is always intent upon the\\nsculpture or paintings that may be preserved there for the delectation\\nof the eye. The tendency is to think little of the architect who made\\nthe buildings where they are treasured. Asked to name the greatest\\nmakers of this beautiful Florence, the ordinary visitor would\\nsay Michelangelo, Giotto, Raphael, Donatello, the della Robbias,\\nGhirlandaio, and Andrea del Sarto: all before Brunelleschi, even if\\nhe named him at all. But this is wrong. Not even Michelangelo did\\nso much for Florence as he. Michelangelo was no doubt the greatest\\nindividualist in the whole history of art, and everything that he did\\ngrips the memory in a vice; but Florence without Michelangelo would\\nstill be very nearly Florence, whereas Florence without Brunelleschi\\nis unthinkable. No dome to the cathedral, first of all; no S. Lorenzo\\nchurch or cloisters; no S. Croce cloisters or Pazzi chapel; no Badia\\nof Fiesole. Honour where honour is due. We should be singing the\\npraises of Filippo Brunelleschi in every quarter of the city.\\n\\nAfter Brunelleschi the chief architect of the cathedral was Giuliano da\\nMaiano, the artist of the beautiful intarsia woodwork in the sacristy,\\nand the uncle of Benedetto da Maiano who made the S. Croce pulpit.\\n\\nThe present fa\\u00e7ade is the work of the architect Emilio de Fabris,\\nwhose tablet is to be seen on the left wall. It was finished in 1887,\\nfive hundred and more years after the abandonment of Arnolfo's original\\ndesign and three hundred and more years after the destruction of the\\nsecond one, begun in 1357 and demolished in 1587. Of Arnolfo's fa\\u00e7ade\\nthe primitive seated statue of Boniface VIII (or John XXII) just inside\\nthe cathedral is, with a bishop in one of the sacristies, the only\\nremnant; while of the second fa\\u00e7ade, for which Donatello and other\\nearly Renaissance sculptors worked, the giant S. John the Evangelist,\\nin the left aisle, is perhaps the most important relic. Other statues\\nin the cathedral were also there, while the central figure -- the Madonna\\nwith enamel eyes -- may be seen in the cathedral museum. Although not\\ngreat, the group of the Madonna and Child now over the central door\\nof the Duomo has much charm and benignancy.\\n\\nThe present fa\\u00e7ade, although attractive as a mass of light, is not\\nreally good. Its patterns are trivial, its paintings and statues\\ncommonplace; and I personally have the feeling that it would have\\nbeen more fitting had Giotto's marble been supplied rather with\\na contrast than an imitation. As it is, it is not till Giotto's\\ntower soars above the fa\\u00e7ade that one can rightly (from the front)\\nappreciate its roseate delicacy, so strong is this rival.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nThe Duomo II: Its Associations\\n\\nDante's picture -- Sir John Hawkwood -- Ancestor and Descendant -- The Pazzi\\nConspiracy -- Squeamish Montesecco -- Giuliano de' Medici dies -- Lorenzo's\\nescape -- Vengeance on the Pazzi -- Botticelli's cartoon -- High\\nMass -- Luca della Robbia -- Michelangelo nearing the end -- The Miracles\\nof Zenobius -- East and West meet in splendour -- Marsilio Ficino and\\nthe New Learning -- Beautiful glass.\\n\\nOf the four men most concerned in the structure of the Duomo I have\\nalready spoken. There are other men held in memory there, and certain\\npaintings and statues, of which I wish to speak now.\\n\\nThe picture of Dante in the left aisle was painted by command of\\nthe Republic in 1465, one hundred and sixty-three years after his\\nbanishment from the city. Lectures on Dante were frequently delivered\\nin the churches of Florence during the fourteenth and fifteenth\\ncenturies, and it was interesting for those attending them to have\\na portrait on the wall. This picture was painted by Domenico di\\nMichelino, the portrait of Dante being prepared for him by Alessio\\nBaldovinetti, who probably took it from Giotto's fresco in the chapel\\nof the Podest\\u00e1 at the Bargello. In this picture Dante stands between\\nthe Inferno and a concentrated Florence in which portions of the\\nDuomo, the Signoria, the Badia, the Bargello, and Or San Michele are\\nvisible. Behind him is Paradise. In his hand is the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\". I\\nsay no more of the poet here, because a large part of the chapter on\\nthe Badia is given to him.\\n\\nNear the Dante picture in the left aisle are two Donatellos -- the\\nmassive S. John the Evangelist, seated, who might have given ideas\\nto Michelangelo for his Moses a century and more later; and, nearer\\nthe door, between the tablets to De Fabris and Squarciaparello, the\\nso-called Poggio Bracciolini, a witty Italian statesman and Humanist\\nand friend of the Medici, who, however, since he was much younger than\\nthis figure at the time of its exhibition, and is not known to have\\nvisited Florence till later, probably did not sit for it. But it is\\na powerful and very natural work, although its author never intended\\nit to stand on any floor, even of so dim a cathedral as this. The\\nS. John, I may say, was brought from the old fa\\u00e7ade -- not Arnolfo's,\\nbut the committee's fa\\u00e7ade -- where it had a niche about ten feet from\\nthe ground. The Poggio was also on this fa\\u00e7ade, but higher. It was\\nPoggio's son, Jacopo, who took part in the Pazzi Conspiracy, of which\\nwe are about to read, and was very properly hanged for it.\\n\\nOf the two pictures on the entrance wall, so high as to be imperfectly\\nseen, that on the right as you face it has peculiar interest to\\nEnglish visitors, for (painted by Paolo Uccello, whose great battle\\npiece enriches our National Gallery) it represents Sir John Hawkwood,\\nan English free-lance and head of the famous White Company, who\\nafter some successful raids on Papal territory in Provence, put his\\nsword, his military genius, and his bravoes at the service of the\\nhighest bidder among the warlike cities and provinces of Italy, and,\\neventually passing wholly into the employment of Florence (after\\nharrying her for other pay-masters for some years), delivered her\\nvery signally from her enemies in 1392. Hawkwood was an Essex man,\\nthe son of a tanner at Hinckford, and was born there early in the\\nfourteenth century. He seems to have reached France as an archer under\\nEdward III, and to have remained a free-booter, passing on to Italy,\\nabout 1362, to engage joyously in as much fighting as any English\\ncommander can ever have had, for some thirty years, with very good\\npay for it. Although, by all accounts, a very Salomon Brazenhead,\\nHawkwood had enough dignity to be appointed English Ambassador to Rome,\\nand later to Florence, which he made his home, and where he died in\\n1394. He was buried in the Duomo, on the north side of the choir, and\\nwas to have reposed beneath a sumptuous monument made under his own\\ninstructions, with frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi and Giuliano d'Arrigo;\\nbut something intervened, and Uccello's fresco was used instead,\\nand this, some sixty years ago, was transferred to canvas and moved\\nto the position in which it now is seen.\\n\\nHawkwood's life, briskly told by a full-blooded hand, would make a fine\\nbook. One pleasant story at least is related of him, that on being\\nbeset by some begging friars who prefaced their mendicancy with the\\nwords, \\\"God give you peace,\\\" he answered, \\\"God take away your alms\\\";\\nand, on their protesting, reminded them that such peace was the last\\nthing he required, since should their pious wish come true he would\\ndie of hunger. One of the daughters of this fire-eater married John\\nShelley, and thus became an ancestress of Shelley the poet, who,\\nas it chances, also found a home for a while in this city, almost\\nwithin hailing distance of his ancestor's tomb and portrait, and here\\nwrote not only his \\\"Ode to the West Wind,\\\" but his caustic satire,\\n\\\"Peter Bell the Third\\\".\\n\\nHawkwood's name is steeped sufficiently in carnage; but we get to the\\nscene of bloodshed in reality as we approach the choir, for it was\\nhere that Giuliano de' Medici was assassinated, as he attended High\\nMass, on April 26th, 1478, with the connivance, if not actually at the\\ninstigation, of Christ's Vicar himself, Pope Sixtus IV. Florentine\\nhistory is so eventful and so tortuous that beyond the bare outline\\ngiven in chapter V, I shall make in these pages but little effort to\\nfollow it, assuming a certain amount of knowledge on the part of the\\nreader; but it must be stated here that periodical revolts against\\nthe power and prestige of the Medici often occurred, and none was\\nmore desperate than that of the Pazzi family in 1478, acting with\\nthe support of the Pope behind all and with the co-operation of\\nGirolamo Riario, nephew of the Pope, and Salviati, Archbishop of\\nPisa. The Pazzi, who were not only opposed to the temporal power\\nof the Medici, but were their rivals in business -- both families\\nbeing bankers -- wished to rid Florence of Lorenzo and Giuliano in\\norder to be greater both civically and financially. Girolamo wished\\nthe removal of Lorenzo and Giuliano in order that hostility to his\\nplans for adding Forli and Faenza to the territory of Imola, which\\nthe Pope had successfully won for him against Lorenzo's opposition,\\nmight disappear. The Pope had various political reasons for wishing\\nLorenzo's and Giuliano's death and bringing Florence, always headstrong\\nand dangerous, to heel. While as for Salviati, it was sufficient that\\nhe was Archbishop of Pisa, Florence's ancient rival and foe; but he\\nwas a thoroughly bad lot anyway. Assassination also was in the air,\\nfor Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan had been stabbed in church in 1476,\\nthus to some extent paving the way for this murder, since Lorenzo\\nand Sforza, when acting together, had been practically unassailable.\\n\\nIn 1478 Lorenzo was twenty-nine, Giuliano twenty-five. Lorenzo had\\nbeen at the head of Florentine affairs for nine years and he was\\nsteadily growing in strength and popularity. Hence it was now or never.\\n\\nThe conspirators' first idea was to kill the brothers at a banquet\\nwhich Lorenzo was to give to the great-nephew of the Pope, the\\nyouthful Cardinal Raffaello Riario, who promised to be an amenable\\ncatspaw. Giuliano, however, having hurt his leg, was not well enough to\\nbe present, but as he would attend High Mass, the conspirators decided\\nto act then. That is to say, it was then, in the cathedral, that the\\ndeath of the Medici brothers was to be effected; meanwhile another\\ndetachment of conspirators under Salviati was to rise simultaneously to\\ncapture the Signoria, while the armed men of the party who were outside\\nand inside the walls would begin their attacks on the populace. Thus,\\nat the same moment Medici and city would fall. Such was the plan.\\n\\nThe actual assassins were Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini,\\nwho were nominally friends of the Medici (Francesco's brother Guglielmo\\nhaving married Bianca de' Medici, Lorenzo's sister), and two priests\\nnamed Maffeo da Volterra and Stefano da Bagnone. A professional bravo\\nnamed Montesecco was to have killed Lorenzo, but refused on learning\\nthat the scene of the murder was to be a church. At that, he said,\\nhe drew the line: murder anywhere else he could perform cheerfully,\\nbut in a sacred building it was too much to ask. He therefore did\\nnothing, but, subsequently confessing, made the guilt of all his\\nassociates doubly certain.\\n\\nWhen High Mass began it was found that Giuliano was not present,\\nand Francesco de' Pazzi and Bandini were sent to persuade him to\\ncome -- a Judas-like errand indeed. On the way back, it is said, one\\nof them affectionately placed his arm round Giuliano -- to see if he\\nwore a shirt of mail -- remarking, to cover the action, that he was\\ngetting fat. On his arrival, Giuliano took his place at the north\\nside of the circular choir, near the door which leads to the Via de'\\nServi, while Lorenzo stood at the opposite side. At the given signal\\nBandini and Pazzi were to stab Giuliano and the two priests were to\\nstab Lorenzo. The signal was the breaking of the Eucharistic wafer,\\nand at this solemn moment Giuliano was instantly killed, with one stab\\nin the heart and nineteen elsewhere, Francesco so overdoing his attack\\nthat he severely wounded himself too; but Lorenzo was in time to see\\nthe beginning of the assault, and, making a movement to escape, he\\nprevented the priest from doing aught but inflict a gash in his neck,\\nand, springing away, dashed behind the altar to the old sacristy,\\nwhere certain of his friends who followed him banged the heavy bronze\\ndoors on the pursuing foe. Those in the cathedral, mean-while, were in\\na state of hysterical alarm; the youthful cardinal was hurried into\\nthe new sacristy; Guglielmo de' Pazzi bellowed forth his innocence\\nin loud tones; and his murderous brother and Bandini got off.\\n\\nOrder being restored, Lorenzo was led by a strong bodyguard to\\nthe Palazzo Medici, where he appeared at a window to convince the\\nmomentarily increasing crowd that he was still living. Meanwhile\\nthings were going not much more satisfactorily for the Pazzi at\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio, where, according to the plan, the gonfalonier,\\nCesare Petrucci, was to be either killed or secured. The Archbishop\\nSalviati, who was to effect this, managed his interview so clumsily\\nthat Petrucci suspected something, those being suspicious times,\\nand, instead of submitting to capture, himself turned the key on his\\nvisitors. The Pazzi faction in the city, meanwhile, hoping that all\\nhad gone well in the Palazzo Vecchio, as well as in the cathedral\\n(as they thought), were running through the streets calling \\\"Viva la\\nLibert\\u00e0!\\\" to be met with counter cries of \\\"Palle! palle!\\\" -- the palle\\nbeing the balls on the Medici escutcheon, still to be seen all over\\nFlorence and its vicinity and on every curtain in the Uffizi.\\n\\nThe truth gradually spreading, the city then rose for the Medici and\\njustice began to be done. The Archbishop was handed at once, just as\\nhe was, from a window of the Palazzo Vecchio. Francesco de' Pazzi,\\nwho had got home to bed, was dragged to the Palazzo and hanged too. The\\nmob meanwhile were not idle, and most of the Pazzi were accounted for,\\ntogether with many followers -- although Lorenzo publicly implored them\\nto be merciful. Poliziano, the scholar-poet and friend of Lorenzo,\\nhas left a vivid account of the day. With his own eyes he saw the\\nhanging Salviati, in his last throes, bite the hanging Francesco de\\nPazzi. Old Jacopo succeeded in escaping, but not for long, and a day\\nor so later he too was hanged. Bandini got as far as Constantinople,\\nbut was brought back in chains and hanged. The two priests hid in\\nthe Benedictine abbey in the city and for a while evaded search,\\nbut being found they were torn to pieces by the crowd. Montesecco,\\nhaving confessed, was beheaded in the courtyard of the Bargello.\\n\\nThe hanging of the chief conspirators was kept in the minds of the\\nshort-memoried Florentines by a representation outside the Palazzo\\nVecchio, by none other than the wistful, spiritual Botticelli; while\\nthree effigies, life size, of Lorenzo -- one of them with his bandaged\\nneck -- were made by Verrocchio in coloured wax and set up in places\\nwhere prayers might be offered. Commemorative medals which may be\\nseen in the Bargello, were also struck, and the family of Pazzi was\\nbanished and its name removed by decree from the city's archives. Poor\\nGiuliano, who was generally beloved for his charm and youthful spirits,\\nwas buried at S. Lorenzo in great state.\\n\\nI have often attended High Mass in this Duomo choir -- the theatre of\\nthe Pazzi tragedy -- but never without thinking of that scene.\\n\\nLuca della Robbia's doors to the new sacristy, which gave the young\\ncardinal his safety, had been finished only eleven years. Donatello was\\nto have designed them, but his work at Padua was too pressing. The\\ncommission was then given to Michelozzo, Donatello's partner,\\nand to Luca della Robbia, but it seems likely that Luca did nearly\\nall. The doors are in very high relief, thus differing absolutely\\nfrom Donatello's at S. Lorenzo, which are in very low. Luca's work\\nhere is sweet and mild rather than strong, and the panels derive\\ntheir principal charm from the angels, who, in pairs, attend the\\nsaints. Above the door was placed, at the time of Lorenzo's escape,\\nthe beautiful cantoria, also by Luca, which is now in the museum of\\nthe cathedral, while above the door of the old sacristy was Donatello's\\ncantoria. Commonplace new ones now take their place. In the semicircle\\nover each door is a coloured relief by Luca: that over the bronze doors\\nbeing the \\\"Resurrection,\\\" and the other the \\\"Ascension\\\"; and they are\\ninteresting not only for their beauty but as being the earliest-known\\nexamples in Luca's newly-discovered glazed terra-cotta medium,\\nwhich was to do so much in the hands of himself, his nephew Andrea,\\nand his followers, to make Florence still lovelier and the legend\\nof the Virgin Mary still sweeter. But of the della Robbias and their\\nexquisite genius I shall say more later, when we come to the Bargello.\\n\\nAs different as would be possible to imagine is the genius of that\\nyounger sculptor, the author of the Piet\\u00e0 at the back of the altar,\\nnear where we now stand, who, when Luca finished these bronze doors,\\nin 1467, was not yet born -- Michelangelo Buonarroti. This group, which\\nis unfinished, is the last the old and weary Titan ever worked at,\\nand it was meant to be part of his own tomb. Vasari, to whose \\\"Lives\\nof the Painters\\\" we shall be indebted, as this book proceeds, for so\\nmuch good human nature, and who speaks of Michelangelo with peculiar\\nauthority, since he was his friend, pupil, and correspondent, tells us\\nthat once when he went to see the sculptor in Rome, near the end, he\\nfound him at work upon this Piet\\u00e0, but the sculptor was so dissatisfied\\nwith one portion that he let his lantern fall in order that Vasari\\nmight not see it, saying: \\\"I am so old that death frequently drags\\nat my mantle to take me, and one day my person will fall like this\\nlantern\\\". The Piet\\u00e0 is still in deep gloom, as the master would have\\nliked, but enough is revealed to prove its pathos and its power.\\n\\nIn the east end of the nave is the chapel of S. Zenobius, containing a\\nbronze reliquary by Ghiberti, with scenes upon it from the life of this\\nsaint, so important in Florentine religious history. It is, however,\\nvery hard to see, and should be illuminated. Zenobius was born at\\nFlorence in the reign of Constantine the Great, when Christianity\\nwas by no means the prevailing religion of the city, although the\\nway had been paved by various martyrs. After studying philosophy\\nand preaching with much acceptance, Zenobius was summoned to Rome\\nby Pope Damasus. On the Pope's death he became Bishop of Florence,\\nand did much, says Butler, to \\\"extirpate the kingdom of Satan\\\". The\\nsaint lived in the ancient tower which still stands -- one of the few\\nsurvivors of Florence's hundreds of towers -- at the corner of the Via\\nPor S. Maria (which leads from the Mercato Nuovo to the Ponte Vecchio)\\nand the Via Lambertesca. It is called the Torre de' Girolami, and\\non S. Zenobius' day -- May 25th -- is decorated with flowers; and since\\nnever are so many flowers in the city of flowers as at that time, it\\nis a sight to see. The remains of the saint were moved to the Duomo,\\nalthough it had not then its dome, from S. Lorenzo, in 1330, and the\\nsimple column in the centre of the road opposite Ghiberti's first\\nBaptistery doors was erected to mark the event, since on that very\\nspot, it is said, stood a dead elm tree which, when the bier of the\\nsaint chanced to touch it, immediately sprang to life again and burst\\ninto leaf; even, the enthusiastic chronicler adds, into flower. The\\nresult was that the tree was cut completely to pieces by relic hunters,\\nbut the column by the Baptistery, the work of Brunelleschi (erected on\\nthe site of an earlier one), fortunately remains as evidence of the\\nmiracle. Ghiberti, however, did not choose this miracle but another\\nfor representation; for not only did Zenobius dead restore animation,\\nbut while he was himself living he resuscitated two boys. The one was a\\nward of his own; the second was an ordinary Florentine, for whom the\\nsame modest boon was craved by his sorrowing parents. It is one of\\nthese scenes of resuscitation which Ghiberti has designed in bronze,\\nwhile Ridolfo Ghirlandaio painted it in a picture in the Uffizi. We\\nshall see S. Zenobius again in the fresco by Ridolfo's father, the\\ngreat Ghirlandaio, in the Palazzo Vecchio; while the portrait on the\\nfirst pillar of the left aisle, as one enters the cathedral is of\\nZenobius too.\\n\\nThe date of the Pazzi Conspiracy was 1478. A few years later the\\nsame building witnessed the extraordinary effects of Savonarola's\\noratory, when such was the terrible picture he drew of the fate of\\nunregenerate sinners that his listeners' hair was said actually to\\nrise with fright. Savonarola came towards the end of the Renaissance,\\nto give it its death-blow. By contrast there is a tablet on the right\\nwall of the cathedral in honour of one who did much to bring about the\\npaganism and sophistication against which the impassioned reformer\\nuttered his fiercest denunciations: Marsilio Ficino (1433-1491),\\nthe neo-Platonist proteg\\u00e9 of Cosimo de' Medici, and friend both\\nof Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo. To explain Marsilio's influence\\nit is necessary to recede a little into history. In 1439 Cosimo de'\\nMedici succeeded in transferring the scene of the Great Council of the\\nChurch to Florence. At this conference representatives of the Western\\nChurch, centred in Rome, met those of the Eastern Church, centred\\nin Constantinople, which was still Christian, for the purpose of\\ndiscussing various matters, not the least of which was the protection\\nof the Eastern Church against the Infidel. Not only was Constantinople\\ncontinually threatened by the Turks, and in need of arms as well\\nas sympathy, but the two branches of the Church were at enmity over\\na number of points. It was as much to heal these differences as to\\nseek temporal aid that the Emperor John Palaeologus, the Patriarch\\nof Constantinople, and a vast concourse of nobles, priests, and\\nGreek scholars, arrived in Italy, and, after sojourning at Venice\\nand Ferrara, moved on to Florence at the invitation of Cosimo. The\\nEmperor resided in the Peruzzi palace, now no more, near S. Croce;\\nthe Patriarch of Constantinople lodged (and as it chanced, died, for\\nhe was very old) at the Ferrantini palace, now the Casa Vernaccia,\\nin the Borgo Pinti; while Pope Eugenius was at the convent attached\\nto S. Maria Novella. The meetings of the Council were held where we\\nnow stand -- in the cathedral, whose dome had just been placed upon it\\nall ready for them.\\n\\nThe Council failed in its purpose, and, as we know, Constantinople\\nwas lost some years later, and the great empire of which John\\nPalaeologus was the last ruler ceased to be. That, however, at the\\nmoment is beside the mark. The interesting thing to us is that among\\nthe scholars who came from Constantinople, bringing with them numbers\\nof manuscripts and systems of thought wholly new to the Florentines,\\nwas one Georgius Gemisthos, a Greek philosopher of much personal\\ncharm and comeliness, who talked a bland and beautiful Platonism that\\nwas extremely alluring not only to his youthful listeners but also\\nto Cosimo himself. Gemisthos was, however, a Greek, and Cosimo was\\ntoo busy a man in a city of enemies, or at any rate of the envious,\\nto be able to do much more than extend his patronage to the old man\\nand despatch emissaries to the East for more and more manuscripts;\\nbut discerning the allurements of the new gospel, Cosimo directed\\na Florentine enthusiast who knew Greek to spread the serene creed\\namong his friends, who were all ripe for it, and this enthusiast was\\nnone other than a youthful scholar by name Marsilio Ficino, connected\\nwith S. Lorenzo, Cosimo's family church, and the son of Cosimo's own\\nphysician. To the young and ardent Marsilio, Plato became a god and\\nGemisthos not less than divine for bringing the tidings. He kept a lamp\\nalways burning before Plato's bust, and later founded the Platonic\\nAcademy, at which Plato's works were discussed, orations delivered,\\nand new dialogues exchanged, between such keen minds as Marsilio,\\nPulci, Landini, Giovanni Cavalcanti, Leon Battista Alberti, the\\narchitect and scholar, Pico dell a Mirandola, the precocious disputant\\nand aristocratic mystic, Poliziano, the tutor of Lorenzo's sons, and\\nLorenzo the Magnificent himself. It was thus from the Greek invasion\\nof Florence that proceeded the stream of culture which is known as\\nHumanism, and which, no doubt, in time, was so largely concerned in\\nbringing about that indifference to spiritual things which, leading\\nto general laxity and indulgence, filled Savonarola with despair.\\n\\nI am not concerned to enter deeply into the subject of the\\nRenaissance. But this must be said -- that the new painting and\\nsculpture, particularly the painting of Masaccio and the sculpture\\nof Donatello, had shown the world that the human being could be made\\nthe measure of the Divine. The Madonna and Christ had been related\\nto life. The new learning, by leading these keen Tuscan intellects,\\nso eager for reasonableness, to the Greek philosophers who were so\\nwise and so calm without any of the consolations of Christianity,\\nnaturally set them wondering if there were not a religion of Humanity\\nthat was perhaps a finer thing than the religion that required all the\\nmachinery and intrigue of Rome. And when, as the knowledge of Greek\\nspread and the minute examination of documents ensued, it was found\\nthat Rome had not disdained forgery to gain her ends, a blow was struck\\nagainst the Church from which it never recovered; -- and how much of this\\nwas due to this Florentine Marsilio, sitting at the feet of the Greek\\nGemisthos, who came to Florence at the invitation of Cosimo de' Medici!\\n\\nThe cathedral glass, as I say, is mostly overladen with grime; but the\\ncircular windows in the dome seem to be magnificent in design. They\\nare attributed to Ghiberti and Donatello, and are lovely in colour. The\\ngreens in particular are very striking. But the jewel of these circular\\nwindows of Florence is that by Ghiberti on the west wall of S. Croce.\\n\\nAnd here I leave the Duomo, with the counsel to visitors to Florence\\nto make a point of entering it every day -- not, as so many Florentines\\ndo, in order to make a short cut from the Via Calzaioli to the Via de'\\nServi, and vice vers\\u00e2, but to gather its spirit. It is different every\\nhour in the day, and every hour the light enters it with new beauty.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nThe Duomo III: A Ceremony and a Museum\\n\\nThe Scoppio del Carro -- The Pazzi beneficent -- Holy Saturday's\\nprogramme -- April 6th, 1912 -- The flying palle -- The nervous\\npyrotechnist -- The influence of noon -- A little sister of the\\nDuomo -- Donatello's cantoria -- Luca della Robbia's cantoria.\\n\\nIn the last chapter we saw the Pazzi family as very black sheep,\\nalthough there are plenty of students of Florentine history who\\nhold that any attempt to rid Florence of the Medici was laudable. In\\nthis chapter we see them in a kindlier situation as benefactors to\\nthe city. For it happened that when Pazzo de' Pazzi, a founder of\\nthe house, was in the Holy Land during the First Crusade, it was his\\nproud lot to set the Christian banner on the walls of Jerusalem, and,\\nas a reward, Godfrey of Boulogne gave him some flints from the Holy\\nSepulchre. These he brought to Florence, and they are now preserved\\nat SS. Apostoli, the little church in the Piazza del Limbo, off the\\nBorgo SS. Apostoli, and every year the flints are used to kindle\\nthe fire needed for the right preservation of Easter Day. Gradually\\nthe ceremony enlarged until it became a spectacle indeed, which the\\nPazzi family for centuries controlled. After the Pazzi conspiracy\\nthey lost it and the Signoria took it over; but, on being pardoned,\\nthe Pazzi again resumed.\\n\\nThe Carro is a car containing explosives, and the Scoppio is its\\nexplosion. This car, after being drawn in procession through the\\nstreets by white oxen, is ignited by the sacred fire borne to it by\\na mechanical dove liberated at the high altar of the Duomo, and with\\nits explosion Easter begins. There is still a Pazzi fund towards the\\nexpenses, but a few years ago the city became responsible for the\\nwhole proceedings, and the ceremony as it is now given, under civic\\nmanagement, known as the Scoppio del Cairo, is that which I saw on\\nHoly Saturday last and am about to describe.\\n\\nFirst, however, let me state what had happened before the proceedings\\nopened in the Piazza del Duomo. At six o'clock mass began at\\nSS. Apostoli, lasting for more than two hours. At its close the\\ncelebrant was handed a plate on which were the sacred flints, and these\\nhe struck with a steel in view of the congregation, thus igniting a\\ntaper. The candle, in an ancient copper porta fuoco surmounted by a\\ndove, was then lighted, and the procession of priests started off for\\nthe cathedral with their precious flame, escorted by a civic guard\\nand various standard bearers. Their route was the Piazza del Limbo,\\nalong the Borgo SS. Apostoli to the Via Por S. Maria and through\\nthe Vacchereccia to the Piazza della Signoria, the Via Condotta, the\\nVia del Proconsolo, to the Duomo, through whose central doors they\\npassed, depositing the sacred burden at the high altar. I should add\\nthat anyone on the route in charge of a street shrine had the right\\nto stop the procession in order to take a light from it; while at\\nSS. Apostoli women congregated with tapers and lanterns in the hope\\nof getting these kindled from the sacred flame, in order to wash\\ntheir babies or cook their food in water heated with the fire.\\n\\nMeanwhile at seven o'clock the four oxen, which are kept in the\\nCascine all the year round and do no other work, had been harnessed to\\nthe car and had drawn it to the Piazza del Duomo, which was reached\\nabout nine. The oxen were then tethered by the Pisano doors of the\\nBaptistery until needed again.\\n\\nAfter some haggling on the night before, I had secured a seat on a\\nbalcony facing Ghiberti's first Baptistery doors, for eleven lire, and\\nto this place I went at half-past ten. The piazza was then filling up,\\nand at a quarter to eleven the trams running between the Cathedral and\\nthe Baptistery were stopped. In this space was the car. The present\\none, which dates from 1622, is more like a catafalque, and unless one\\nsees it in motion, with the massive white oxen pulling it, one cannot\\nbelieve in it as a vehicle at all. It is some thirty feet high, all\\nblack, with trumpery coloured-paper festoons (concealing fireworks)\\nupon it: trumpery as only the Roman Catholic Church can contrive. It\\nstood in front of the Duomo some four yards from the Baptistery gates\\nin a line with the Duomo's central doors and the high altar. The\\ndoors were open, seats being placed on each side of the aisle the\\nwhole distance, and people making a solid avenue. Down this avenue\\nwere to come the clergy, and above it was to be stretched the line\\non which the dove was to travel from the altar, with the Pazzi fire,\\nto ignite the car.\\n\\nThe space in front of the cathedral was cleared at about eleven,\\nand cocked hats and red-striped trousers then became the most\\nnoticeable feature. The crowd was jolly and perhaps a little cynical;\\npicture-postcard hawkers made most of the noise, and for some reason\\nor other a forlorn peasant took this opportunity to offer for sale two\\nequally forlorn hedgehogs. Each moment the concourse increased, for it\\nis a fateful day and every one wants to know the issue: because, you\\nsee, if the dove runs true, lights the car, and returns, as a good dove\\nshould, to the altar ark, there will be a prosperous vintage and the\\npyrotechnist who controls the sacred bird's movements will receive his\\nwages. But if the dove runs defectively and there is any hitch, every\\none is dismayed, for the harvest will be bad and the pyrotechnist will\\nreceive nothing. Once he was imprisoned when things went astray -- and\\nquite right too -- but the Florentines have grown more lenient.\\n\\nAt about a quarter past eleven a procession of clergy emerged from the\\nDuomo and crossed the space to the Baptistery. First, boys and youths\\nin surplices. Then some scarlet hoods, waddling. Then purple hoods,\\nand other colours, a little paunchier, waddling more, and lastly the\\narchbishop, very sumptuous. All having disappeared into the Baptistery,\\nthrough Ghiberti's second gates, which I never saw opened before, the\\ndove's wire was stretched and fastened, a matter needing much care;\\nand the crowds began to surge. The cocked hats and officers had the\\nspace all to themselves, with the car, the firemen, the pyrotechnist\\nand the few privileged and very self-conscious civilians who were\\nallowed inside.\\n\\nA curious incident, which many years ago might have been magnified\\ninto a portent, occurred while the ecclesiastics were in the Artistry.\\nSome one either bought and liberated several air balloons, or the\\nstring holding them was surreptitiously cut; but however it happened,\\nthe balls escaped and suddenly the crowd sent up a triumphant yell. At\\nfirst I could see no reason for it, the Baptistery intervening,\\nbut then the balls swam into our ken and steadily floated over\\nthe cathedral out of sight amid tremendous satisfaction. And the\\nportent? Well, as they moved against the blue sky they formed\\nthemselves into precisely the pattern of the palle on the Medici\\nescutcheon. That is all. But think what that would have meant in the\\nfifteenth century; the nods and frowns it would have occasioned; the\\ndispersal of the Medici, the loss of power, and all the rest of it,\\nthat it would have presaged!\\n\\nAt about twenty to twelve the ecclesiastics returned and were\\nswallowed up by the Duomo, and then excitement began to be acute. The\\npyrotechnist was not free from it; he fussed about nervously; he tested\\neverything again and again; he crawled under the car and out of it;\\nhe talked to officials; he inspected and re-inspected. Photographers\\nbegan to adjust their distances; the detached men in bowlers looked\\nat their watches; the cocked hats drew nearer to the Duomo door. And\\nthen we heard a tearing noise. All eyes were turned to the great door,\\nand out rushed the dove emitting a wake of sparks, entered the car\\nand was out again on its homeward journey before one realized what had\\nhappened. And then the explosions began, and the bells -- silent since\\nThursday -- broke out. How many explosions there were I do not know;\\nbut they seemed to go on for ten minutes.\\n\\nThis is a great moment not only for the spectator but for all Florence,\\nfor in myriad rooms mothers have been waiting, with their babies\\non their knees, for the first clang of the belfries, because if a\\nchild's eyes are washed then it is unlikely ever to have weak sight,\\nwhile if a baby takes its first steps to this accompaniment its legs\\nwill not be bowed.\\n\\nAt the last explosion the pyrotechnist, now a calm man once more\\nand a proud one, approached the car, the firemen poured water on\\nsmouldering parts, and the work of clearing up began. Then came\\nthe patient oxen, their horns and hooves gilt, and great masses of\\nflowers on their heads, and red cloths with the lily of Florence\\non it over their backs -- much to be regretted since they obliterated\\ntheir beautiful white skins -- and slowly the car lumbered off, and,\\nthe cocked hats relenting, the crowd poured after it and the Scoppio\\ndel Carro was over.\\n\\nThe Duomo has a little sister in the shape of the Museo di Santa\\nMaria del Fiore, or the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo, situated in the\\nPiazza opposite the apse; and we should go there now. This museum,\\nwhich is at once the smallest and, with the exception of the Natural\\nHistory Museum, the cheapest of the Florentine museums, for it\\ncosts but half a lira, is notable for containing the two cantorie,\\nor singing galleries, made for the cathedral, one by Donatello and\\none by Luca della Robbia. A cantoria by Donatello we shall soon see in\\nits place in S. Lorenzo; but that, beautiful as it is, cannot compare\\nwith this one, with its procession of merry, dancing children, its\\nmassiveness and grace, its joyous ebullitions of gold mosaic and blue\\nenamel. Both the cantorie -- Donatello's, begun in 1433 and finished\\nin 1439, and Luca's, begun in 1431 and finished in 1438 -- fulfilled\\ntheir melodious functions in the Duomo until 1688, when they were\\nruthlessly cleared away to make room for large wooden balconies to\\nbe used in connexion with the nuptials of Ferdinand de' Medici and\\nthe Princess Violante of Bavaria. In the year 1688 taste was at a low\\nebb, and no one thought the deposed cantorie even worth preservation,\\nso that they were broken up and occasionally levied upon for cornices\\nand so forth. The fragments were collected and taken to the Bargello\\nin the middle of the last century, and in 1883 Signer del Moro, the\\nthen architect of the Duomo (whose bust is in the courtyard of this\\nmuseum), reconstructed them to the best of his ability in their present\\nsituation. It has to be remembered not only that, with the exception\\nof the figures, the galleries are not as their artists made them,\\nlacking many beautiful accessories, but that, as Vasari tells us,\\nDonatello deliberately designed his for a dim light. None the less,\\nthey remain two of the most delightful works of the Renaissance and\\ntwo of the rarest treasures of Florence.\\n\\nThe dancing boys behind the small pillars with their gold chequering,\\nthe brackets, and the urn of the cornice over the second pair\\nof pillars from the right, are all that remain of Donatello's own\\nhandiwork. All else is new and conjectural. It is supposed that bronze\\nheads of lions filled the two circular spaces between the brackets\\nin the middle. But although the loss of the work as a whole is to be\\nregretted, the dancing boys remain, to be for ever an inspiration and\\na pleasure. The Luca della Robbia cantoria opposite is not quite so\\ntriumphant a masterpiece, but from the point of view of suitability it\\nis perhaps better. We can believe that Luca's children hymn the glory\\nof the Lord, as indeed the inscription makes them, whereas Donatello's\\nromp with a gladness that might easily be purely pagan. Luca's design\\nis more formal, more conventional; Donatello's is rich and free and\\nfluid with personality. The two end panels of Luca's are supplied in\\nthe cantoria by casts; the originals are on the wall below and may\\nbe carefully studied. The animation and fervour of these choristers\\nare unforgettable.\\n\\nIt is well, while enjoying Donatello's work, to remember that Prato\\nis only half an hour from Florence, and that there may be seen\\nthe open-air pulpit, built on the corner of the cathedral, which\\nDonatello, with Michelozzo, his friend and colleague, made at the\\nsame time that the cantoria was in progress, and which in its relief\\nof happy children is very similar, although not, I think, quite so\\nremarkable. It lacks also the peculiarly naturalistic effect gained\\nin the cantoria by setting the dancing boys behind the pillars, which\\nundoubtedly, as comparison with the Luca shows, assists realism. The\\nrow of pillars attracts the eye first and the boys are thus thrown\\ninto a background which almost moves.\\n\\nAlthough the cantorie dominate the museum they must not be allowed to\\novershadow all else. A marble relief of the Madonna and Children by\\nAgostino di Duccio (1418-1481) must be sought for: it is No. 77 and\\nthe children are the merriest in Florence. Another memorable Madonna\\nand Child is No. 94, by Pagno di Lapo Portigiani (1406-1470), who has\\ninterest for us in this place as being one of Donatello's assistants,\\nvery possibly on this very cantoria, and almost certainly on the Prato\\npulpit. Everything here, it must be remembered, has some association\\nwith the Duomo and was brought here for careful preservation and that\\nwhoever has fifty centimes might take pleasure in seeing it; but the\\ngreat silver altar is from the Baptistery, and being made for that\\ntemple is naturally dedicated to the life of John the Baptist. Although\\nmuch of it was the work of not the greatest modellers in the second\\nhalf of the fourteenth century, three masters at least contributed\\nlater: Michelozzo adding the statue of the Baptist, Pollaiuolo the\\nside relief depicting his birth, and Verrocchio that of his death,\\nwhich is considered one of the most remarkable works of this sculptor,\\nwhom we are to find so richly represented at the Bargello. Before\\nleaving this room, look for 100^3, an unknown terra-cotta of the\\nBirth of Eve, which is both masterly and amusing, and 110^4, a very\\nlovely intaglio in wood. I might add that among the few paintings,\\nall very early, is a S. Sebastian in whose sacred body I counted no\\nfewer than thirty arrows; which within my knowledge of pictures of\\nthis saint -- not inconsiderable -- is the highest number.\\n\\nThe next room is given to models and architectural plans and\\ndrawings connected with the cathedral, the most interesting thing\\nbeing Brunelleschi's own model for the lantern. On the stairs are a\\nseries of fine bas-reliefs by Bandinelli and Giovanni dell' Opera from\\nthe old choir screen of the Duomo, and downstairs, among many other\\npieces of sculpture, is a bust of Brunelleschi from a death-mask and\\nseveral beautiful della Robbia designs for lunettes over doors.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nThe Campanile and the Baptistery\\n\\nA short way with Veronese critics -- Giotto's missing spire -- Donatello's\\nholy men -- Giotto as encyclopaedist -- The seven and twenty\\nreliefs -- Ruskin in American -- At the top of the tower -- A sea of\\nred roofs -- The restful Baptistery -- Historic stones -- An ex-Pope's\\ntomb -- Andrea Pisano's doors -- Ghiberti's first doors -- Ghiberti's second\\ndoors -- Michelangelo's praise -- A gentleman artist.\\n\\nIt was in 1332, as I have said, that Giotto was made capo-maestro,\\nand on July 18th, 1334, the first stone of his campanile was laid, the\\nunderstanding being that the structure was to exceed \\\"in magnificence,\\nheight, and excellence of workmanship\\\" anything in the world. As\\nsome further indication of the glorious feeling of patriotism then\\nanimating the Florentines, it may be remarked that when a Veronese\\nwho happened to be in Florence ventured to suggest that the city\\nwas aiming rather too high, he was at once thrown into gaol, and,\\non being set free when his time was done, was shown the treasury as\\nan object lesson. Of the wealth and purposefulness of Florence at\\nthat time, in spite of the disastrous bellicose period she had been\\npassing through, Villani the historian, who wrote history as it was\\nbeing made, gives an excellent account, which Macaulay summarizes in\\nhis vivid way. Thus: \\\"The revenue of the Republic amounted to three\\nhundred thousand florins; a sum which, allowing for the depreciation of\\nthe precious metals, was at least equivalent to six hundred thousand\\npounds sterling; a larger sum than England and Ireland, two centuries\\nago, yielded to Elizabeth. The manufacture of wool alone employed two\\nhundred factories and thirty thousand workmen. The cloth annually\\nproduced sold, at an average, for twelve hundred thousand florins;\\na sum fully equal in exchangeable value to two millions and a half of\\nour money. Four hundred thousand florins were annually coined. Eighty\\nbanks conducted the commercial operations, not of Florence only but of\\nall Europe. The transactions of these establishments were sometimes\\nof a magnitude which may surprise even the contemporaries of the\\nBarings and the Rothschilds. Two houses advanced to Edward III of\\nEngland upwards of three hundred thousand marks, at a time when the\\nmark contained more silver than fifty shillings of the present day,\\nand when the value of silver was more than quadruple of what it now\\nis. The city and its environs contained a hundred and seventy thousand\\nchildren inhabitants. In the various schools about ten thousand\\nchildren were taught to read; twelve hundred studied arithmetic;\\nsix hundred received a learned education.\\\"\\n\\nGiotto died in 1386, and after his death, as I have said, Andrea\\nPisano came in for a while; to be followed by Talenti, who is said\\nto have made considerable alterations in Giotto's design and to\\nbe responsible for the happy idea of increasing the height of the\\nwindows with the height of the tower and thus adding to the illusion\\nof springing lightness. The topmost ones, so bold in size and so\\nlovely with their spiral columns, almost seem to lift it.\\n\\nThe campanile to-day is 276 feet in height, and Giotto proposed to\\nadd to that a spire of 105 feet. The Florentines completed the fa\\u00e7ade\\nof the cathedral in 1887 and are now spending enormous sums on the\\nMedici chapel at S. Lorenzo; why should they not one day carry out\\ntheir greatest artist's intention?\\n\\nThe campanile as a structure had been finished in 1387, but not for\\nmany years did it receive its statues, of which something must be said,\\nalthough it is impossible to get more than a vague idea of them, so\\nhigh are they. A captive balloon should be arranged for the use of\\nvisitors. Those by Donatello, on the Baptistery side, are the most\\nremarkable. The first of these -- that nearest to the cathedral and\\nthe most striking as seen from the distant earth -- is called John the\\nBaptist, always a favourite subject with this sculptor, who, since\\nhe more than any at that thoughtful time endeavoured to discover\\nand disclose the secret of character, is curiously unfortunate in\\nthe accident that has fastened names to these figures. This John,\\nfor example, bears no relation to his other Baptists; nor does the\\nnext figure represent David, as is generally supposed, but owes that\\nerror to the circumstance that when the David that originally stood\\nhere was moved to the north side, the old plinth bearing his name was\\nleft behind. This famous figure is stated by Vasari to be a portrait of\\na Florentine merchant named Barduccio Cherichini, and for centuries it\\nhas been known as Il Zuccone (or pumpkin) from its baldness. Donatello,\\naccording to Vasari, had a particular liking for the work, so much that\\nhe used to swear by it; while, when engaged upon it, he is said to\\nhave so believed in its reality as to exclaim, \\\"Speak, speak! or may\\na dysentery seize thee!\\\" It is now generally considered to represent\\nJob, and we cannot too much regret the impossibility of getting near\\nenough to study it. Next is the Jeremiah, which, according to Vasari,\\nwas a portrait of another Florentine, but which, since he bears his\\nname on a scroll, may none the less be taken to realize the sculptor's\\nidea of Jeremiah. It is (according to the photographs) a fine piece\\nof rugged vivacity, and the head is absolutely that of a real man. On\\nthe opposite side of the tower is the magnificent Abraham's sacrifice\\nfrom the same strong hand, and by it Habakkuk, who is no less near\\nlife than the Jeremiah and Job, but a very different type. At both\\nOr San Michele and the Bargello we are to find Donatello perhaps in\\na finer mood than here, and comfortably visible.\\n\\nFor most visitors to Florence and all disciples of Ruskin, the chief\\ninterest of the campanile (\\\"The Shepherd's Tower\\\" as he calls it)\\nis the series of twenty-seven reliefs illustrating the history of\\nthe world and the progress of mankind, which are to be seen round the\\nbase, the design, it is supposed, of Giotto, executed by Andrea Pisano\\nand Luca della Robbia. To Andrea are given all those on the west (7),\\nsouth (7), east (5), and the two eastern ones on the north; to Luca the\\nremaining five on the north. Ruskin's fascinating analysis of these\\nreliefs should most certainly be read (without a total forgetfulness\\nof the shepherd's other activities as a painter, architect, humorist,\\nand friend of princes and poets), but equally certainly not in the\\nAmerican pirated edition which the Florentine booksellers are so ready\\n(to their shame) to sell you. Only Ruskin in his best mood of fury\\ncould begin to do justice to the misspellings and mispunctuations of\\nthis terrible production.\\n\\nRuskin, I may say, believes several of the carvings to be from\\nGiotto's own chisel as well as design, but other and more modern\\nauthorities disagree, although opinion now inclines to the belief\\nthat the designs for Pisano's Baptistery doors are also his. Such\\nthoroughness and ingenuity were all in Giotto's way, and they certainly\\nsuggest his active mind. The campanile series begins at the west side\\nwith the creation of man. Among the most attractive are, I think,\\nthose devoted to agriculture, with the spirited oxen, to astronomy, to\\narchitecture, to weaving, and to pottery. Giotto was even so thorough\\nas to give one relief to the conquest of the air; and he makes Noah\\nmost satisfactorily drunk. Note also the Florentine fleur-de-lis\\nround the base of the tower. Every fleur-de-lis in Florence is\\nbeautiful -- even those on advertisements and fire-plugs -- but few are\\nmore beautiful than these.\\n\\nI climbed the campanile one fine morning -- 417 steps from the\\nground -- and was well repaid; but I think it is wiser to ascend the\\ntower of the Palazzo Vecchio, because one is higher there and, since\\nthe bulk of the dome, which intrudes from the campanile, is avoided,\\none has a better all-round view. Florence seen from this eminence\\nis very red -- so uniformly so that many towers rise against it almost\\nindistinguishably, particularly the Bargello's and the Badia's. One\\nsees at once how few straight streets there are -- the Ricasoli standing\\nout among them as the exception; and one realizes how the city has\\ndeveloped outside, with its boulevards where the walls once were,\\nleaving the gates isolated, and its cincture of factories. The\\noccasional glimpses of cloisters and verdure among the red are very\\npleasant. One of the objects cut off by the cathedral dome is the\\nEnglish cemetery, but the modern Jewish temple stands out as noticeably\\nalmost as any of the ancient buildings. The Pitti looks like nothing\\nbut a barracks and the Porta Ferdinando has prominence which it gets\\nfrom no other point. The roof of the Mercato Centrale is the ugliest\\nthing in the view. While I was there the midday gun from the Boboli\\nfortress was fired, instantly having its punctual double effect of\\nsending all the pigeons up in a grey cloud of simulated alarm and\\nstarting every bell in the city.\\n\\nThose wishing to make either the campanile or Duomo ascents must\\nremember to do it early. The closing hour for the day being twelve,\\nno one is allowed to start up after about a quarter past eleven: a\\nvery foolish arrangement, since Florence and the surrounding Apennines\\nunder a slanting sun are more beautiful than in the morning glare,\\nand the ascent would be less fatiguing. As it was, on descending, after\\nbeing so long at the top, I was severely reprimanded by the custodian,\\nwho had previously marked me down as a barbarian for refusing his offer\\nof field-glasses. But the Palazzo Vecchio tower is open till five.\\n\\nThe Baptistery is the beautiful octagonal building opposite the\\ncathedral, and once the cathedral itself. It dates from the seventh\\nor eighth century, but as we see it now is a product chiefly of the\\nthirteenth. The bronze doors opposite the Via Calzaioli are open every\\nday, a circumstance which visitors, baffled by the two sets of Ghiberti\\ndoors always so firmly closed, are apt to overlook. All children born\\nin Florence are still baptized here, and I watched one afternoon an old\\npriest at the task, a tiny Florentine being brought in to receive the\\nname of Tosca, which she did with less distaste than most, considering\\nhow thorough was his sprinkling. The Baptistery is rich in colour\\nboth without and within. The floor alone is a marvel of intricate\\ninlaying, including the signs of the zodiac and a gnomic sentence which\\nreads the same backwards and forwards -- \\\"En gire torte sol ciclos et\\nroterigne\\\". On this very pavement Dante, who called the church his\\n\\\"beautiful San Giovanni,\\\" has walked. Over the altar is a gigantic\\nand primitive Christ in mosaic, more splendid than spiritual. The\\nmosaics in the recesses of the clerestory -- grey and white -- are the\\nmost soft and lovely of all. I believe the Baptistery is the most\\nrestful place in Florence; and this is rather odd considering that it\\nis all marble and mosaic patterns. But its shape is very soothing,\\nand age has given it a quality of its own, and there is just that\\ntouch of barbarism about it such as one gets in Byzantine buildings\\nto lend it a peculiar character here.\\n\\nThe most notable sculpture in the Baptistery is the tomb of the ex-Pope\\nJohn XXIII, whose licentiousness was such that there was nothing for\\nit but to depose and imprison him. He had, however, much money, and on\\nhis liberation he settled in Florence, presented a true finger of John\\nthe Baptist to the Baptistery, and arranged in return for his bones\\nto repose in that sanctuary. One of his executors was that Niccol\\u00f2\\nda Uzzano, the head of the noble faction in the city, whose coloured\\nbust by Donatello is in the Bargello. The tomb is exceedingly fine,\\nthe work of Donatello and his partner Michelozzo, who were engaged\\nto make it by Giovanni de' Medici, the ex-pontiff's friend, and the\\nfather of the great Cosimo. The design is all Donatello's, and his\\nthe recumbent cleric, lying very naturally, hardly as if dead at\\nall, a little on one side, so that his face is seen nearly full;\\nthe three figures beneath are Michelozzo's; but Donatello probably\\ncarved the seated angels who display the scroll which bears the\\ndead Pope's name. The Madonna and Child above are by Donatello's\\nassistant, Pagno di Lapo Portigiani, a pretty relief by whom we saw\\nin the Museum of the Cathedral. Being in red stone, and very dusty,\\nlike Ghiberti's doors (which want the hose regularly), the lines of\\nthe tomb are much impaired. Donatello is also represented here by a\\nMary Magdalene in wood, on an altar at the left of the entrance door,\\nvery powerful and poignant.\\n\\nIn the ordinary way, when visitors to Florence speak of the Baptistery\\ndoors they mean those opposite the Duomo, and when they go to the\\nBargello and look at the designs made by Ghiberti and Brunelleschi in\\ncompetition, they think that the competition was for those. But that\\nis wrong. Ghiberti won his spurs with the doors on the north side,\\nat which comparatively few persons look. The famous doors opposite\\nthe Duomo were commissioned many years later, when his genius was\\nacknowledged and when he had become so accomplished as to do what\\nhe liked with his medium. Before, however, coming to Ghiberti,\\nwe ought to look at the work of an early predecessor but for whom\\nthere might have been no Ghiberti at all; for while Ghiberti was at\\nwork with his assistants on these north doors, between 1403 and 1424,\\nthe place which they occupy was filled by those executed seventy years\\nearlier by Andrea Pisano (1270-1348), possibly from Giotto's designs,\\nwhich are now at the south entrance, opposite the charming little\\nloggia at the corner of the Via Calzaioli, called the Bigallo. These\\nrepresent twenty scenes in the life of S. John the Baptist, and below\\nthem are eight figures of cardinal and Christian virtues, and they\\nemployed their sculptor from 1330 to 1336. They have three claims to\\nnotice: as being admirably simple and vigorous in themselves; as having\\ninfluenced all later workers in this medium, and particularly Ghiberti\\nand Donatello; and as being the bronze work of the sculptor of certain\\nof the stone scenes round the base of Giotto's campanile. The panel\\nin which the Baptist is seen up to his waist in the water is surely\\nthe very last word in audacity in bronze. Ghiberti was charged with\\nmaking bronze do things that it was ill fitted for; but I do not know\\nthat even he moulded water -- and transparent water -- from it.\\n\\nThe year 1399 is one of the most notable in the history of modern art,\\nsince it was then that the competition for the Baptistery gates was\\nmade public, this announcement being the spring from which many rivers\\nflowed. In that year Lorenzo Ghiberti, a young goldsmith assisting\\nhis father, was twenty-one, and Filippo Brunelleschi, another\\ngoldsmith, was twenty-two, while Giotto had been dead sixty-three\\nyears and the impulse he had given to painting had almost worked\\nitself out. The new doors were to be of the same shape and size as\\nthose by Andrea Pisano, which were already getting on for seventy\\nyears old, and candidates were invited to make a specimen relief to\\nscale, representing the interrupted sacrifice of Isaac, although\\nthe subject-matter of the doors was to be the Life of S. John the\\nBaptist. Among the judges was that Florentine banker whose name\\nwas beginning to be known in the city as a synonym for philanthropy,\\nenlightenment, and sagacity, Giovanni de' Medici. In 1401 the specimens\\nwere ready, and after much deliberation as to which was the better,\\nGhiberti's or Brunelleschi's -- assisted, some say, by Brunelleschi's\\nown advice in favour of his rival -- the award was given to Ghiberti,\\nand he was instructed to proceed with his task; while Brunelleschi,\\nas we have seen, being a man of determined ambition, left for Rome to\\nstudy architecture, having made up his mind to be second to no one\\nin whichever of the arts and crafts he decided to pursue. Here then\\nwas the first result of the competition -- that it turned Brunelleschi\\nto architecture.\\n\\nGhiberti began seriously in 1408 and continued till 1424, when the\\ndoors were finished; but, in order to carry out the work, he required\\nassistance in casting and so forth, and for that purpose engaged among\\nothers a sculptor named Donatello (born in 1386), a younger sculptor\\nnamed Luca della Robbia (born in 1400), and a gigantic young painter\\ncalled Masaccio (born in 1401), each of whom was destined, taking\\nfire no doubt from Ghiberti and his fine free way, to be a powerful\\ninnovator -- Donatello (apart from other and rarer achievements) being\\nthe first sculptor since antiquity to place a statue on a pedestal\\naround which observers could walk; Masaccio being the first painter\\nto make pictures in the modern use of the term, with men and women\\nof flesh and blood in them, as distinguished from decorative saints,\\nand to be by example the instructor of all the greatest masters,\\nfrom his pupil Lippo Lippi to Leonardo and Michelangelo; and Luca\\ndella Robbia being the inspired discoverer of an inexpensive means of\\nglazing terra-cotta so that his beautiful and radiant Madonnas could\\nbe brought within the purchasing means of the poorest congregation in\\nItaly. These alone are remarkable enough results, but when we recollect\\nalso that Brunelleschi's defeat led to the building of the cathedral\\ndome, the significance of the event becomes the more extraordinary.\\n\\nThe doors, as I say, were finished in 1424, after twenty-one years'\\nlabour, and the Signoria left the Palazzo Vecchio in procession to see\\ntheir installation. In the number and shape of the panels Pisano set\\nthe standard, but Ghiberti's work resembled that of his predecessor\\nvery little in other ways, for he had a mind of domestic sweetness\\nwithout austerity and he was interested in making everything as easy\\nand fluid and beautiful as might be. His thoroughness recalls Giotto\\nin certain of his frescoes. The impression left by Pisano's doors is\\nakin to that left by reading the New Testament; but Ghiberti makes\\neverything happier than that. Two scenes -- both on the level of the\\neye -- I particularly like: the \\\"Annunciation,\\\" with its little, lithe,\\nreluctant Virgin, and the \\\"Adoration\\\". The border of the Pisano doors\\nis, I think, finer than that of Ghiberti's; but it is a later work.\\n\\nLooking at them even now, with eyes that remember so much of the\\nbest art that followed them and took inspiration from them, we\\ncan understand the better how delighted Florence must have been\\nwith this new picture gallery and how the doors were besieged by\\nsightseers. But greater still was to come. Ghiberti at once received\\nthe commission to make two more doors on his own scale for the south\\nside of the Baptistery, and in 1425 he had begun on them. These were\\nnot finished until 1452, so that Ghiberti, then a man of seventy-four,\\nhad given practically his whole life to the making of four bronze\\ndoors. It is true that he did a few other things besides, such as the\\ncasket of S. Zenobius in the Duomo, and the Baptist and S. Matthew\\nfor Or San Michele; but he may be said justly to live by his doors,\\nand particularly by the second pair, although it was the first pair\\nthat had the greater effect on his contemporaries and followers.\\n\\nAmong his assistants on these were Antonio Pollaiuolo (born in\\n1429), who designed the quail in the left border, and Paolo Uccello\\n(born in 1397), both destined to be men of influence. The bald head\\non the right door is a portrait of Ghiberti; that of the old man\\non the left is his father, who helped him to polish the original\\ncompetition plaque. Although commissioned for the south side they\\nwere placed where they now are, on the east, as being most worthy of\\nthe position of honour, and Pisano's doors, which used to be here,\\nwere moved to the south, where they now are.\\n\\nOn Ghiberti's workshop opposite S. Maria Nuova, in the Via Bufalini,\\nthe memorial tablet mentions Michelangelo's praise -- that these doors\\nwere beautiful enough to be the Gates of Paradise. After that what is\\nan ordinary person to say? That they are lovely is a commonplace. But\\nthey are more. They are so sensitive; bronze, the medium which Horace\\nhas called, by implication, the most durable of all, has become in\\nGhiberti's hands almost as soft as wax and tender as flesh. It does\\nall he asks; it almost moves; every trace of sternness has vanished\\nfrom it. Nothing in plastic art that we have ever seen or shall see\\nis more easy and ingratiating than these almost living pictures.\\n\\nBefore them there is steadily a little knot of admirers, and on\\nSundays you may always see country people explaining the panels to each\\nother. Every one has his favourite among these fascinating Biblical\\nscenes, and mine are Cain and Abel, with the ploughing, and Abraham\\nand Isaac, with its row of fir trees. It has been explained by the\\npurists that the sculptor stretched the bounds of plastic art too\\nfar and made bronze paint pictures; but most persons will agree to\\nignore that. Of the charm of Ghiberti's mind the border gives further\\nevidence, with its fruits and foliage, birds and woodland creatures,\\nso true to life, and here fixed for all time, so naturally, that if\\nthese animals should ever (as is not unlikely in Italy where every\\none has a gun and shoots at his pleasure) become extinct, they could\\nbe created again from these designs.\\n\\nGhiberti, who enjoyed great honour in his life and a considerable\\nsalary as joint architect of the dome with Brunelleschi, died three\\nyears after the completion of the second doors and was buried in\\nS. Croce. His place in Florentine art is unique and glorious.\\n\\nThe broken porphyry pillars by these second doors were a gift from\\nPisa to Florence in recognition of Florence's watchfulness over Pisa\\nwhile the Pisans were away subduing the Balearic islanders.\\n\\nThe bronze group over Ghiberti's first doors, representing John\\nthe Baptist preaching between a Pharisee and a Levite, are the\\nwork (either alone or assisted by his master Leonardo da Vinci)\\nof an interesting Florentine sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Rustici\\n(1474-1554), who was remarkable among the artists of his time in\\nbeing what we should call an amateur, having a competence of his own\\nand the manners of a patron. Placing himself under Verrocchio, he\\nbecame closely attached to Leonardo, a fellow-pupil, and made him his\\nmodel rather than the older man. He took his art lightly, and lived,\\nin Vasari's phrase, \\\"free from care,\\\" having such beguilements as a\\ntame menagerie (Leonardo, it will be remembered, loved animals too and\\nhad a habit of buying small caged birds in order to set them free),\\nand two or three dining clubs, the members of which vied with each\\nother in devising curious and exotic dishes. Andrea del Sarto, for\\nexample, once brought as his contribution to the feast a model of this\\nvery church we are studying, the Baptistery, of which the floor was\\nconstructed of jelly, the pillars of sausages, and the choir desk of\\ncold veal, while the choristers were roast thrushes. Rustici further\\npaved the way to a life free from care by appointing a steward of his\\nestate whose duty it was to see that his money-box, to which he went\\nwhenever he wanted anything, always had money in it. This box he never\\nlocked, having learned that he need fear no robbery by once leaving\\nhis cloak for two days under a bush and then finding it again. \\\"This\\nworld,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"is too good: it will not last.\\\" Among his pets\\nwere a porcupine trained to prick the legs of his guests under the\\ntable \\\"so that they drew them in quickly\\\"; a raven that spoke like a\\nhuman being; an eagle, and many snakes. He also studied necromancy,\\nthe better to frighten his apprentices. He left Florence in 1528,\\nafter the Medici expulsion, and, like Leonardo, took service with\\nFrancis the First. He died at the age of eighty.\\n\\nI had an hour and more exactly opposite the Rustici group, on the same\\nlevel, while waiting for the Scoppio del Carro, and I find it easy\\nto believe that Leonardo himself had a hand in the work. The figure\\nof the Baptist is superb, the attitude of his listeners masterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nThe Riccardi Palace and the Medici\\n\\nAn evasion of history -- \\\"Il Caparra\\\" -- The Gozzoli frescoes -- Giovanni\\nde' Medici (di Bicci) -- Cosimo de' Medici -- The first banishment -- Piero\\nde' Medici -- Lorenzo de' Medici -- Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici -- The\\nsecond banishment -- Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici -- Leo X -- Lorenzo di\\nPiero di Lorenzo de' Medici -- Clement VII -- Third banishment of the\\nMedici -- The siege of Florence -- Alessandro de' Medici -- Ippolito de'\\nMedici -- Lorenzino de' Medici -- Giovanni delle Bande Nere -- Cosimo I -- The\\nGrand Dukes.\\n\\nThe natural step from the Baptistery would be to the Uffizi. But for\\nus not yet; because in order to understand Florence, and particularly\\nthe Florence that existed between the extreme dates that I have chosen\\nas containing the fascinating period -- namely 1296, when the Duomo was\\nbegun, and 1564, when Michelangelo died -- one must understand who and\\nwhat the Medici were.\\n\\nWhile I have been enjoying the pleasant task of writing this\\nbook -- which has been more agreeable than any literary work I have ever\\ndone -- I have continually been conscious of a plaintive voice at my\\nshoulder, proceeding from one of the vigilant and embarrassing imps\\nwho sit there and do duty as conscience, inquiring if the time is not\\nabout ripe for introducing that historical sketch of Florence without\\nwhich no account such as this can be rightly understood. And ever I\\nhave replied with words of a soothing and procrastinating nature. But\\nnow that we are face to face with the Medici family, in their very\\nhouse, I am conscious that the occasion for that historical sketch\\nis here indeed, and equally I am conscious of being quite incapable\\nof supplying it. For the history of Florence between, say the birth\\nof Giotto or Dante and the return of Cosimo de' Medici from exile,\\nwhen the absolute Medici rule began, is so turbulent, crowded, and\\ncomplex that it would require the whole of this volume to describe\\nit. The changes in the government of the city would alone occupy a\\ngood third, so constant and complicated were they. I should have to\\nexplain the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, the Neri and the Bianchi,\\nthe Guilds and the Priors, the gonfalonieri and the podesta, the\\nsecondo popolo and the buonuomini.\\n\\nRather than do this imperfectly I have chosen to do it not at all;\\nand the curious must resort to historians proper. But there is at\\nthe end of the volume a table of the chief dates in Florentine and\\nEuropean history in the period chosen, together with births and deaths\\nof artists and poets and other important persons, so that a bird's-eye\\nview of the progress of affairs can be quickly gained, while in this\\nchapter I offer an outline of the great family of rulers of Florence\\nwho made the little city an aesthetic lawgiver to the world and with\\nwhom her later fame, good or ill, is indissolubly united. For the rest,\\nis there not the library?\\n\\nThe Medici, once so powerful and stimulating, are still ever in the\\nbackground of Florence as one wanders hither and thither. They are\\nbehind many of the best pictures and most of the best statues. Their\\nescutcheon is everywhere. I ought, I believe, to have made them\\nthe subject of my first chapter. But since I did not, let us without\\nfurther delay turn to the Via Cavour, which runs away to the north from\\nthe Baptistery, being a continuation of the Via de' Martelli, and pause\\nat the massive and dignified palace at the first corner on the left.\\nFor that is the Medici's home; and afterwards we will step into\\nS. Lorenzo and see the church which Brunelleschi and Donatello made\\nbeautiful and Michelangelo wonderful that the Medici might lie there.\\n\\nVisitors go to the Riccardi palace rather to see Gozzoli's frescoes\\nthan anything else; and indeed apart from the noble solid Renaissance\\narchitecture of Michelozzo there is not much else to see. In the\\ncourtyard are certain fragments of antique sculpture arranged against\\nthe walls, and a sarcophagus is shown in which an early member of the\\nfamily, Guccio de' Medici, who was gonfalonier in 1299, once reposed.\\nThere too are Donatello's eight medallions, but they are not very\\ninteresting, being only enlarged copies of old medals and cameos and\\nnot notable for his own characteristics.\\n\\nHence it is that, after Gozzoli, by far the most interesting\\npart of this building is its associations. For here lived Cosimo\\nde' Medici, whose building of the palace was interrupted by his\\nbanishment as a citizen of dangerous ambition; here lived Piero\\nde' Medici, for whom Gozzoli worked; here was born and here lived\\nLorenzo the Magnificent. To this palace came the Pazzi conspirators\\nto lure Giuliano to the Duomo and his doom. Here did Charles\\nVIII -- Savonarola's \\\"Flagellum Dei\\\" -- lodge and loot, and it was here\\nthat Capponi frightened him with the threat of the Florentine bells;\\nhither came in 1494 the fickle and terrible Florentine mob, always\\npassionate in its pursuit of change and excitement, and now inflamed\\nby the sermons of Savonarola, to destroy the priceless manuscripts\\nand works of art; here was brought up for a year or so the little\\nCatherine de' Medici, and next door was the house in which Alessandro\\nde' Medici was murdered.\\n\\nIt was in the seventeenth century that the palace passed to the\\nRiccardi family, who made many additions. A century later Florence\\nacquired it, and to-day it is the seat of the Prefect of the\\ncity. Cosimo's original building was smaller; but much of it remains\\nuntouched. The exquisite cornice is Michelozzo's original, and the\\ncourtyard has merely lost its statues, among which are Donatello's\\nJudith, now in the Loggia de' Lanzi, and his bronze David, now in the\\nBargello, while Verrocchio's David was probably on the stairs. The\\nescutcheon on the corner of the house gives us the period of its\\nerection. The seven plain balls proclaim it Cosimo's. Each of\\nthe Medici sported these palle, although each had also his private\\ncrest. Under Giovanni, Cosimo's father, the balls were eight in number;\\nunder Cosimo, seven; under Piero, seven, with the fleur-de-lis of\\nFrance on the uppermost, given him by Louis XI; under Lorenzo, six;\\nand as one walks about Florence one can approximately fix the date of\\na building by remembering these changes. How many times they occur on\\nthe fa\\u00e7ades of Florence and its vicinity, probably no one could say;\\nbut they are everywhere. The French wits, who were amused to derive\\nCatherine de' Medici from a family of apothecaries, called them pills.\\n\\nThe beautiful lantern at the corner was added by Lorenzo and was\\nthe work of an odd ironsmith in Florence for whom he had a great\\nliking -- Niccol\\u00f2 Grosso. For Lorenzo had all that delight in character\\nwhich belongs so often to the born patron and usually to the born\\nconnoisseur. This Grosso was a man of humorous independence and\\nbluntness. He had the admirable custom of carrying out his commissions\\nin the order in which they arrived, so that if he was at work upon a\\nset of fire-irons for a poor client, not even Lorenzo himself (who as\\na matter of fact often tried) could induce him to turn to something\\nmore lucrative. The rich who cannot wait he forced to wait. Grosso\\nalso always insisted upon something in advance and payment on\\ndelivery, and pleasantly described his workshop as being the Sign\\nof the Burning Books, -- since if his books were burnt how could he\\nenter a debt? This rule earned for him from Lorenzo the nickname of\\n\\\"Il Caparra\\\" (earnest money). Another of Grosso's eccentricities was\\nto refuse to work for Jews.\\n\\nWithin the palace, up stairs, is the little chapel which Gozzoli made\\nso gay and fascinating that it is probably the very gem among the\\nprivate chapels of the world. Here not only did the Medici perform\\ntheir devotions -- Lorenzo's corner seat is still shown, and anyone\\nmay sit in it -- but their splendour and taste are reflected on the\\nwalls. Cosimo, as we shall see when we reach S. Marco, invited Fra\\nAngelico to paint upon the walls of that convent sweet and simple\\nfrescoes to the glory of God. Piero employed Fra Angelico's pupil,\\nBenozzo Gozzoli to decorate this chapel.\\n\\nIn the year 1439, as chapter II related, through the instrumentality\\nof Cosimo a great episcopal Council was held at Florence, at which\\nJohn Palaeologus, Emperor of the East, met Pope Eugenius IV. In that\\nyear Cosimo's son Piero was twenty-three, and Gozzoli nineteen,\\nand probably upon both, but certainly on the young artist, such\\npomp and splendour and gorgeousness of costume as then were visible\\nin Florence made a deep impression. When therefore Piero, after\\nbecoming head of the family, decided to decorate the chapel with\\na procession of Magi, it is not surprising that the painter should\\nrecall this historic occasion. We thus get the pageantry of the East\\nwith more than common realism, while the portraits, or at any rate\\nrepresentations, of the Patriarch of Constantinople (the first king)\\nand the Emperor (the second king) are here, together with those of\\ncertain Medici, for the youthful third king is none other than Piero's\\neldest son Lorenzo. Among their followers are (the third on the left)\\nCosimo de' Medici, who is included as among the living, although,\\nlike the Patriarch of Constantinople, he was dead, and his brother\\nLorenzo (the middle one of the three), whose existence is forgotten\\nso completely until the accession of Cosimo I, in 1537, brings his\\nbranch of the family into power; while on the right is Piero de'\\nMedici himself. Piero's second son Giuliano is on the white horse,\\npreceded by a negro carrying his bow. The head immediately above\\nGiuliano I do not know, but that one a little to the left above it\\nis Gozzoli's own. Among the throng are men of learning who either\\ncame to Florence from the East or Florentines who assimilated their\\nphilosophy -- such as Georgius Gemisthos, Marsilio Ficino, and perhaps\\ncertain painters among them, all prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9s of Cosimo and Piero, and\\nall makers of the Renaissance.\\n\\nThe assemblage alone, apart altogether from any beauty and charm\\nthat the painting possesses, makes these frescoes valuable. But the\\npainting is a delight. We have a pretty Gozzoli in our National\\nGallery -- No. 283 -- but it gives no indication of the ripeness and\\nrichness and incident of this work; while the famous Biblical\\nseries in the Campo Santo of Pisa has so largely perished as to be\\nscarcely evidence to his colour. The first impression made by the\\nMedici frescoes is their sumptuousness. When Gozzoli painted -- if the\\nstory be true -- he had only candle light: the window over the altar\\nis new. But think of candle light being all the illumination of these\\nwalls as the painter worked! A new door and window have also been cut\\nin the wall opposite the altar close to the three daughters of Piero,\\nby vandal hands; and \\\"Bruta, bruta!\\\" says the guardian, very rightly.\\n\\nThe landscape behind the procession is hardly less interesting than the\\nprocession itself; but it is when we come to the meadows of paradise,\\nwith the angels and roses, the cypresses and birds, in the two chancel\\nscenes, that this side of Gozzoli's art is most fascinating. He has\\ntravelled a long way from his master Fra Angelico here: the heaven\\nis of the visible rather than the invisible eye; sense is present\\nas well as the rapturous spirit. The little Medici who endured the\\ntedium of the services here are to be felicitated with upon such an\\nadorable presentment of glory. With plenty of altar candles the sight\\nof these gardens of the blest must have beguiled many a mass. Thinking\\nhere in England upon the Medici chapel, I find that the impression\\nit has left upon me is chiefly cypresses -- cypresses black and comely,\\ndisposed by a master hand, with a glint of gold among them.\\n\\nThe picture that was over the altar has gone. It was a Lippo Lippi\\nand is now in Berlin.\\n\\nThe first of the Medici family to rise to the highest power was\\nGiovanni d'Averardo de' Medici (known as Giovanni di Bicci), 1360-1429,\\nwho, a wealthy banker living in what is now the Piazza del Duomo,\\nwas well known for his philanthropy and interest in the welfare of\\nthe Florentines, but does not come much into public notice until\\n1401, when he was appointed one of the judges in the Baptistery door\\ncompetition. He was a retiring, watchful man. Whether he was personally\\nambitious is not too evident, but he was opposed to tyranny and was the\\nsteady foe of the Albizzi faction, who at that time were endeavouring\\nto obtain supreme power in Florentine affairs. In 1419 Giovanni\\nincreased his popularity by founding the Spedale degli Innocenti,\\nand in 1421 he was elected gonfalonier, or, as we might now say,\\nPresident of the Republic. In this capacity he made his position\\nsecure and reduced the nobles (chief of whom was Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano)\\nto political weakness. Giovanni died in 1429, leaving one son, Cosimo,\\naged forty, a second, Lorenzo, aged thirtyfour, a fragrant memory\\nand an immense fortune.\\n\\nTo Lorenzo, who remained a private citizen, we shall return in time;\\nit is Cosimo (1389-1464) with whom we are now concerned. Cosimo de'\\nMedici was a man of great mental and practical ability: he had been\\neducated as well as possible; he had a passion both for art and\\nletters; he inherited his father's financial ability and generosity,\\nwhile he added to these gifts a certain genius for the management\\nof men. One of the first things that Cosimo did after his father's\\ndeath was to begin the palace where we now are, rejecting a plan by\\nBrunelleschi as too splendid, and choosing instead one by Michelozzo,\\nthe partner of Donatello, two artists who remained his personal\\nfriends through life. Cosimo selected this site, in what was then\\nthe Via Larga but is now the Via Cavour, partly because his father\\nhad once lived there, and partly because it was close to S. Lorenzo,\\nwhich his father, with six other families, had begun to rebuild,\\na work he intended himself to carry on.\\n\\nThe palace was begun in 1430 abd was still in progress in 1433 when\\nthe Albizzi, who had always viewed the rise of the Medici family\\nwith apprehension and misgiving, and were now strengthened by the\\ndeath of Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano, who, though powerful, had been a very\\ncautious and temperate adviser, succeeded in getting a majority\\nin the Signoria and passing a sentence of banishment on the whole\\nMedici tribe as being too rich and ambitious to be good citizens of\\na simple and frugal Republic. Cosimo therefore, after some days of\\nimprisonment in the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, during which he\\nexpected execution at any moment, left Florence for Venice, taking\\nhis architect with him. In 1434, however, the Florentines, realizing\\nthat under the Albizzi they were losing their independence, and what\\nwas to be a democracy was become an oligarchy, revolted, and Cosimo\\nwas recalled, and, like his father, was elected gonfalonier. With this\\nrecall began his long supremacy; for he returned like a king and like\\na king remained, quickly establishing himself as the leading man in\\nthe city, the power behind the Signoria. Not only did he never lose\\nthat position, but he made it so naturally his own that when he died\\nhe was able to transmit it to his son.\\n\\nCosimo de' Medici was, I think, the wisest and best ruler that Florence\\never had and ranks high among the rulers that any state ever had. But\\nhe changed the Florentines from an independent people to a dependent\\none. In his capacity of Father of his Country he saw to it that his\\nchildren lost their proud spirit. He had to be absolute; and this\\nend he achieved in many ways, but chiefly by his wealth, which made\\nit possible to break the rich rebel and to enslave the poor. His\\ngreatest asset -- next his wealth -- was his knowledge of the Florentine\\ncharacter. To know anything of this capricious, fickle, turbulent\\nfolk even after the event was in itself a task of such magnitude that\\nalmost no one else had compassed it; but Cosimo did more, he knew what\\nthey were likely to do. By this knowledge, together with his riches,\\nhis craft, his tact, his business ramifications as an international\\nbanker, his open-handedness and air of personal simplicity, Cosimo\\nmade himself a power. For Florence could he not\\ndo enough. By inviting the Pope and the Greek Emperor to meet there\\nhe gave it great political importance, and incidentally brought\\nabout the New Learning. He established the Platonic Academy and\\nformed the first public library in the west. He rebuilt and endowed\\nthe monastery of S. Marco. He built and rebuilt other churches. He\\ngave Donatello a free hand in sculpture and Fra Lippo Lippi and Fra\\nAngelico in painting. He distributed altogether in charity and churches\\nfour hundred thousand of those golden coins which were invented by\\nFlorence and named florins after her -- a sum equal to a million pounds\\nof to-day. In every direction one comes upon traces of his generosity\\nand thoroughness. After his death it was decided that as Pater Patriae,\\nor Father of his Country, he should be for ever known.\\n\\nCosimo died in 1464, leaving an invalid son, Piero, aged forty-eight,\\nknown for his almost continuous gout as Il Gottoso. Giovanni and Cosimo\\nhad had to work for their power; Piero stepped naturally into it,\\nalthough almost immediately he had to deal with a plot -- the first for\\nthirty years -- to ruin the Medici prestige, the leader of which was that\\nLuca Pitti who began the Pitti palace in order to have a better house\\nthan the Medici. The plot failed, not a little owing to young Lorenzo\\nde' Medici's address, and the remaining few years of Piero's life were\\ntranquil. He was a quiet, kindly man with the traditional family love\\nof the arts, and it was for him that Gozzoli worked. He died in 1469,\\nleaving two sons, Lorenzo (1449-1492) and Giuliano (1453-1478).\\n\\nLorenzo had been brought up as the future leading citizen of Florence:\\nhe had every advantage of education and environment, and was rich in\\nthe aristocratic spirit which often blossoms most richly in the second\\nor third generation of wealthy business families. Giovanni had been\\na banker before everything, Cosimo an administrator, Piero a faithful\\ninheritor of his father's wishes; it was left for Lorenzo to be the\\nfirst poet and natural prince of the Medici blood. Lorenzo continued\\nto bank but mismanaged the work and lost heavily; while his poetical\\ntendencies no doubt distracted his attention generally from affairs.\\nYet such was his sympathetic understanding and his native splendour and\\ngift of leadership that he could not but be at the head of everything,\\nthe first to be consulted and ingratiated. Not only was he the first\\nMedici poet but the first of the family to marry not for love but\\nfor policy, and that too was a sign of decadence.\\n\\nLorenzo came into power when only twenty, and at the age of forty-two\\nhe was dead, but in the interval, by his interest in every kind of\\nintellectual and artistic activity, by his passion for the greatness\\nand glory of Florence, he made for himself a name that must always\\nconnote liberality, splendour, and enlightenment. But it is beyond\\nquestion that under Lorenzo the Florentines changed deeply and for\\nthe worse. The old thrift and simplicity gave way to extravagance and\\nostentation; the old faith gave way too, but that was not wholly the\\neffect of Lorenzo's natural inclination towards Platonic philosophy,\\nfostered by his tutor Marsilio Ficino and his friends Poliziano and\\nPico della Mirandola, but was due in no small measure also to the\\nhostility of Pope Sixtus, which culminated in the Pazzi Conspiracy of\\n1478 and the murder of Giuliano. Looking at the history of Florence\\nfrom our present vantage-point we can see that although under\\nLorenzo the Magnificent she was the centre of the world's culture\\nand distinction, there was behind this dazzling front no seriousness\\nof purpose. She was in short enjoying the fruits of her labours as\\nthough the time of rest had come; and this when strenuousness was more\\nthan ever important. Lorenzo carried on every good work of his father\\nand grandfather (he spent \\u00a365,000 a year in books alone) and was as\\njealous of Florentine interests; but he was also \\\"The Magnificent,\\\"\\nand in that lay the peril. Florence could do with wealth and power,\\nbut magnificence went to her head.\\n\\nLorenzo died in 1492, leaving three sons, of whom the eldest, Piero\\n(1471-1503), succeeded him. Never was such a decadence. In a moment\\nthe Medici prestige, which had been steadily growing under Cosimo,\\nPiero, and Lorenzo until it was world famous, crumbled to dust. Piero\\nwas a coarse-minded, pleasure-loving youth -- \\\"The Headstrong\\\" his\\nfather had called him -- whose one idea of power was to be sensual and\\ntyrannical; and the enemies of Florence and of Italy took advantage\\nof this fact. Savonarola's sermons had paved the way from within\\ntoo. In 1494 Charles VIII of France marched into Italy; Piero pulled\\nhimself together and visited the king to make terms for Florence,\\nbut made such terms that on returning to the city he found an order\\nof banishment and obeyed it. On November 9th, 1494, he and his family\\nwere expelled, and the mob, forgetting so quickly all that they owed\\nto the Medici who had gone before, rushed to this beautiful palace and\\nlooted it. The losses that art and learning sustained in a few hours\\ncan never be estimated. A certain number of treasures were subsequently\\ncollected again, such as Donatello's David and Verrocchio's David,\\nwhile Donatello's Judith was removed to the Palazzo Vecchio, where\\nan inscription was placed upon it saying that her short way with\\nHolofernes was a warning to all traitors; but priceless pictures,\\nsculpture, and MSS. were ruthlessly demolished.\\n\\nIn the chapter on S. Marco we shall read of what experiments in\\ngovernment the Florentines substituted for that of the Medici,\\nSavonarola for a while being at the head of the government, although\\nonly for a brief period which ended amid an orgy of lawlessness; and\\nthen, after a restless period of eighteen years, in which Florence\\nhad every claw cut and was weakened also by dissension, the Medici\\nreturned -- the change being the work of Lorenzo's second son, Giovanni\\nde' Medici, who on the eve of becoming Pope Leo X procured their\\nreinstatement, thus justifying the wisdom of his father in placing\\nhim in the Church. Piero having been drowned long since, his admirable\\nbut ill-starred brother Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, now thirty-three,\\nassumed the control, always under Leo X; while their cousin, Giulio,\\nalso a Churchman, and the natural son of the murdered Giuliano,\\nwas busy, behind the scenes, with the family fortunes.\\n\\nGiuliano lived only till 1516 and was succeeded by his nephew\\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, a son of Peiro, a young man of no more\\npolitical use than his father, and one who quickly became almost\\nequally unpopular. Things indeed were going so badly that Leo X sent\\nGiulio de' Medici (now a cardinal) from Rome to straighten them out,\\nand by some sensible repeals he succeeded in allaying a little of\\nthe bitterness in the city. Lorenzo had one daughter, born in this\\npalace, who was destined to make history -- Catherine de' Medici -- and\\nno son. When therefore he died in 1519, at the age of twenty-seven,\\nafter a life of vicious selfishness (which, however, was no bar\\nto his having the noblest tomb in the world, at S. Lorenzo), the\\nsuccession should have passed to the other branch of the Medici\\nfamily, the descendants of old Giovanni's second son Lorenzo,\\nbrother of Cosimo. But Giulio, at Rome, always at the ear of the\\nindolent, pleasure-loving Leo X, had other projects. Born in 1478,\\nthe illegitimate son of a charming father, Giulio had none of the\\ngreat Medici traditions, and the Medici name never stood so low as\\nduring his period of power. Himself illegitimate, he was the father\\nof an illegitimate son, Alessandro, for whose advancement he toiled\\nmuch as Alexander VI had toiled for that of Caesar Borgia. He had not\\nthe black, bold wickedness of Alexander VI, but as Pope Clement VII,\\nwhich he became in 1523, he was little less admirable. He was cunning,\\nambitious, and tyrannical, and during his pontificate he contrived not\\nonly to make many powerful enemies and to see both Rome and Florence\\nunder siege, but to lose England for the Church.\\n\\nWe move, however, too fast. The year is 1519 and Lorenzo is dead,\\nand the rightful heir to the Medici wealth and power was to be\\nkept out. To do this Giulio himself moved to Florence and settled\\nin the Medici palace, and on his return to Rome Cardinal Passerini\\nwas installed in the Medici palace in his stead, nominally as the\\ncustodian of little Catherine de' Medici and Ippolito, a boy of ten,\\nthe illegitimate son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours. That Florence\\nshould have put up with this Roman control shows us how enfeebled\\nwas her once proud spirit. In 1521 Leo X died, to be succeeded, in\\nspite of all Giulio's efforts, by Adrian of Utrecht, as Adrian VI,\\na good, sincere man who, had he lived, might have enormously changed\\nthe course not only of Italian but of English history. He survived,\\nhowever, for less than two years, and then came Giulio's chance,\\nand he was elected Pope Clement VII.\\n\\nClement's first duty was to make Florence secure, and he therefore\\nsent his son Alessandro, then about thirteen, to join the others\\nat the Medici palace, which thus now contained a resident cardinal,\\nwatchful of Medici interests; a legitimate daughter of Lorenzo, Duke\\nof Urbino (but owing to quarrels she was removed to a convent); an\\nillegitimate son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, the nominal heir and\\nalready a member of the Government; and the Pope's illegitimate son,\\nof whose origin, however, nothing was said, although it was implied\\nthat Lorenzo, Duke of Nemours, was his father.\\n\\nThis was the state of affairs during Clement's war with the Emperor\\nCharles V, which ended with the siege of Rome and the imprisonment\\nof the Pope in the Castle of S. Angelo for some months until he\\ncontrived to escape to Orvieto; and meanwhile Florence, realizing his\\npowerlessness, uttered a decree again banishing the Medici family, and\\nin 1527 they were sent forth from the city for the third time. But even\\nnow, when the move was so safe, Florence lacked courage to carry it\\nout until a member of the Medici family, furious at the presence of the\\nbase-born Medici in the palace, and a professed hater of her base-born\\nuncle Clement VII and all his ways -- Clarice Strozzi, n\\u00e9e Clarice de'\\nMedici, granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent -- came herself to this\\nhouse and drove the usurpers from it with her extremely capable tongue.\\n\\nTo explain clearly the position of the Florentine Republic at this\\ntime would be too deeply to delve into history, but it may briefly be\\nsaid that by means of humiliating surrenders and much crafty diplomacy,\\nClement VII was able to bring about in 1529 peace between the Emperor\\nCharles V and Francis I of France, by which Charles was left master\\nof Italy, while his partner and ally in these transactions, Clement,\\nexpected for his own share certain benefits in which the humiliation\\nof Florence and the exaltation of Alessandro came first. Florence,\\nhaving taken sides with Francis, found herself in any case very badly\\nleft, with the result that at the end of 1529 Charles V's army, with\\nthe papal forces to assist, laid siege to her. The siege lasted for\\nten months, in which the city was most ably defended by Ferrucci,\\nthat gallant soldier whose portrait by Piero di Cosimo is in our\\nNational Gallery -- No. 895 -- and then came a decisive battle in which\\nthe Emperor and Pope were conquerors, a thousand brave Florentines\\nwere put to death and others were imprisoned.\\n\\nAlessandro de' Medici arrived at the Medici palace in 1531, and\\nin 1532 the glorious Florentine Republic of so many years' growth,\\nfor the establishment of which so much good blood had been spilt, was\\ndeclared to be at an end. Alessandro being proclaimed Duke, his first\\nact was to order the demolition of the great bell of the Signoria which\\nhad so often called the citizens to arms or meetings of independence.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ippolito, the natural son of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, and\\ntherefore the rightful heir, after having been sent on various missions\\nby Clement VII, to keep him out of the way, settled at Bologna and took\\nto poetry. He was a kindly, melancholy man with a deep sense of human\\ninjustice; and in 1535, when, after Clement VII's very welcome demise,\\nthe Florentine exiles who either had been banished from Florence by\\nAlessandro or had left of their own volition rather than live in the\\ncity under such a contemptible ruler, sent an embassy to the Emperor\\nCharles V to help them against this new tyrant, Ippolito headed it;\\nbut Alessandro prudently arranged for his assassination en route.\\n\\nIt is unlikely, however, that the Emperor would have done anything,\\nfor in the following year he allowed his daughter Margaret to become\\nAlessandro's wife. That was in 1536. In January, 1537, Lorenzino de'\\nMedici, a cousin, one of the younger branch of the family, assuming\\nthe mantle of Brutus, or liberator, stabbed Alessandro to death while\\nhe was keeping an assignation in the house that then adjoined this\\npalace. Thus died, at the age of twenty-six, one of the most worthless\\nof men, and, although illegitimate, the last of the direct line of\\nCosimo de' Medici, the Father of his Country, to govern Florence.\\n\\nThe next ruler came from the younger branch, to which we now turn. Old\\nGiovanni di Bicci had two sons, Cosimo and Lorenzo. Lorenzo's son, Pier\\nFrancesco de' Medici, had a son Giovanni de' Medici. This Giovanni,\\nwho married Caterina Sforza of Milan, had also a son named Giovanni,\\nborn in 1498, and it was he who was the rightful heir when Lorenzo,\\nDuke of Urbino, died in 1519. He was connected with both sides of\\nthe family, for his father, as I have said, was the great grandson\\nof the first Medici on our list, and his wife was Maria Salviati,\\ndaughter of Lucrezia de' Medici -- herself a daughter of Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent -- and Jacopo Salviati, a wealthy Florentine. When, however,\\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, died in 1519, Giovanni was a young man of\\ntwenty-one with an absorbing passion for fighting, which Clement VII\\n(then Giulio) was only too keen to foster, since he wished him out of\\nthe way in order that his own projects for the ultimate advancement\\nof the base-born Alessandro, and meanwhile of the catspaw, the\\nbase-born Ippolito, might be furthered. Giovanni had already done\\nsome good service in the field, was becoming famous as the head of\\nhis company of Black Bands, and was known as Giovanni delle Bande\\nNere; and his marriage to his cousin Maria Salviati and the birth\\nof his only son Cosimo in 1519 made no difference to his delight\\nin warfare. He was happy only when in the field of battle, and the\\nstruggle between Francis and Charles gave him ample opportunities,\\nfighting on the side of Charles and the Pope and doing many brave and\\ndashing things. He died at an early age, only twenty-eight, in 1526,\\nthe idol of his men, leaving a widow and child in poverty.\\n\\nAlmost immediately afterwards came the third banishment of the Medici\\nfamily from Florence. Giovanni's widow and their son Cosimo got\\nalong as best they could until the murder of Alessandro in 1537,\\nwhen Cosimo was nearly eighteen. He was a quiet, reserved youth,\\nwho had apparently taken but little interest in public affairs, and\\nhad spent his time in the country with his mother, chiefly in field\\nsports. But no sooner was Alessandro dead, and his slayer Lorenzino\\nhad escaped, than Cosimo approached the Florentine council and claimed\\nto be appointed to his rightful place as head of the State, and this\\nclaim he put, or suggested, with so much humility that his wish was\\ngranted. Instantly one of the most remarkable transitions in history\\noccurred: the youth grew up almost in a day and at once began to exert\\nunsuspected reserves of power and authority. In despair a number of\\nthe chief Florentines made an effort to depose him, and a battle was\\nfought at Montemurlo, a few miles from Florence, between Cosimo's\\ntroops, fortified by some French allies, and the insurgents. That\\nwas in 1537; the victory fell to Cosimo; and his long and remarkable\\nreign began with the imprisonment and execution of the chief rebels.\\n\\nAlthough Cosimo made so bloody a beginning he was the first imaginative\\nand thoughtful administrator that Florence had had since Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent. He set himself grimly to build upon the ruins which the\\npast forty and more years had produced; and by the end of his reign he\\nhad worked wonders. As first he lived in the Medici palace, but after\\nmarrying a wealthy wife, Eleanora of Toledo, he transferred his home\\nto the Signoria, now called the Palazzo Vecchio, as a safer spot, and\\nestablished a bodyguard of Swiss lancers in Orcagna's loggia, close\\nby. Later he bought the unfinished Pitti palace with his wife's\\nmoney, finished it, and moved there. Meanwhile he was strengthening\\nhis position in every way by alliances and treaties, and also by the\\nconvenient murder of Lorenzino, the Brutus who had rid Florence of\\nAlessandro ten years earlier, and whose presence in the flesh could\\nnot but be a cause of anxiety since Lorenzino derived from an elder\\nson of the Medici, and Cosimo from a younger. In 1555 the ancient\\nrepublic of Siena fell to Cosimo's troops after a cruel and barbarous\\nsiege and was thereafter merged in Tuscany, and in 1570 Cosimo assumed\\nthe title of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and was crowned at Rome.\\n\\nWhether or not the common accusation against the Medici as a\\nfamily, that they had but one motive -- mercenary ambition and\\nself-aggrandisement -- is true, the fact remains that the crown did\\nnot reach their brows until one hundred and seventy years from the\\nfirst appearance of old Giovanni di Bicci in Florentine affairs. The\\nstatue of Cosimo I in the Piazza della Signoria has a bas-relief of\\nhis coronation. He was then fifty-one; he lived but four more years,\\nand when he died he left a dukedom flourishing in every way: rich,\\npowerful, busy, and enlightened. He had developed and encouraged\\nthe arts, capriciously, as Cellini's \\\"Autobiography\\\" tells us, but\\ngenuinely too, as we can see at the Uffizi and the Pitti. The arts,\\nhowever, were not what they had been, for the great period had passed\\nand Florence was in the trough of the wave. Yet Cosimo found the best\\nmen he could -- Cellini, Bronzino, and Vasari -- and kept them busy. But\\nhis greatest achievement as a connoisseur was his interest in Etruscan\\nremains and the excavations at Arezzo and elsewhere which yielded\\nthe priceless relics now at the Archaeological Museum.\\n\\nWith Cosimo I this swift review of the Medici family ends. The\\nrest have little interest for the visitor to Florence to-day,\\nfor whom Cellini's Perseus, made to Cosimo I's order, is the last\\ngreat artistic achievement in the city in point of time. But I may\\nsay that Cosimo I's direct descendants occupied the throne (as it\\nhad now become) until the death of Gian Gastone, son of Cosimo III,\\nwho died in 1737. Tuscany passed to Austria until 1801. In 1807 it\\nbecame French, and in 1814 Austrian again. In 1860 it was merged in\\nthe Kingdom of Italy under the rule of the monarch who has given his\\nname to the great new Piazza -- Vittorio Emmanuele.\\n\\nAfter Gian Gastone's death one other Medici remained alive: Anna\\nMaria Ludovica, daughter of Cosimo III. Born in 1667, she married\\nthe Elector Palatine of the Rhine, and survived until 1743. It was\\nshe who left to the city the priceless Medici collections, as I have\\nstated in chapter VIII. The earlier and greatest of the Medici are\\nburied in the church of S. Lorenzo or in Michelangelo's sacristy; the\\nlater Medici, beginning with Giovanni delle Bande Nere and his wife,\\nand their son Cosimo I, are in the gorgeous mausoleum that adjoins\\nS. Lorenzo and is still being enriched with precious marbles.\\n\\nSuch is an outline of the history of this wonderful family, and we\\nleave their ancient home, built by the greatest and wisest of them,\\nwith mixed feelings of admiration and pity. They were seldom lovable;\\nthey were often despicable; but where they were great they were\\nvery great indeed. A Latin inscription in the courtyard reminds the\\ntraveller of the distinction which the house possesses, calling it\\nthe home not only of princes but of knowledge herself and a treasury\\nof the arts. But Florence, although it bought the palace from the\\nRiccardi family a century and more ago, has never cared to give it\\nback its rightful name.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nS. Lorenzo and Michelangelo\\n\\nA forlorn fa\\u00e7ade -- The church of the Medici -- Cosimo's\\nparents' tomb -- Donatello's cantoria and pulpits -- Brunelleschi's\\nsacristy -- Donatello again -- The palace of the dead Grand Dukes -- Costly\\nintarsia -- Michelangelo's sacristy -- A weary Titan's life -- The victim\\nof capricious pontiffs -- The Medici tombs -- Mementi mori -- The Casa\\nBuonarroti -- Brunelleschi's cloisters -- A model library.\\n\\nArchitecturally S. Lorenzo does not attract as S. Croce and S. Maria\\nNovella do; but certain treasures of sculpture make it unique. Yet it\\nis a cool scene of noble grey arches, and the ceiling is very happily\\npicked out with gold and colour. Savonarola preached some of his most\\nimportant sermons here; here Lorenzo the Magnificent was married.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade has never yet been finished: it is just ragged brickwork\\nwaiting for its marble, and likely to wait, although such expenditure\\non marble is going on within a few yards of it as makes one gasp. Not\\nvery far away, in the Via Ghibellina, is a house which contains some\\nrough plans by a master hand for this fa\\u00e7ade, drawn some four hundred\\nyears ago -- the hand of none other than Michelangelo, whose scheme\\nwas to make it not only a wonder of architecture but a wonder also\\nof statuary, the fa\\u00e7ade having many niches, each to be filled with\\na sacred figure. But Michelangelo always dreamed on a scale utterly\\ndisproportionate to the foolish little span of life allotted to us\\nand the S. Lorenzo fa\\u00e7ade was never even begun.\\n\\nThe piazza which these untidy bricks overlook is now given up to stalls\\nand is the centre of the cheap clothing district. Looking diagonally\\nacross it from the church one sees the great walls of the courtyard\\nof what is now the Riccardi palace, but was in the great days the\\nMedici palace; and at the corner, facing the Borgo S. Lorenzo, is\\nGiovanni delle Bande Nere, in stone, by the impossible Bandinelli,\\nlooking at least twenty years older than he ever lived to be.\\n\\nS. Lorenzo was a very old church in the time of Giovanni de' Medici,\\nthe first great man of the family, and had already been restored\\nonce, in the eleventh century, but it was his favourite church,\\nchosen by him for his own resting-place, and he spent great sums\\nin improving it. All this with the assistance of Brunelleschi, who\\nis responsible for the interior as we now see it, and would, had he\\nlived, have completed the fa\\u00e7ade. After Giovanni came Cosimo, who also\\ndevoted great sums to the glory of this church, not only assisting\\nBrunelleschi with his work but inducing Donatello to lavish his genius\\nupon it; and the church was thus established as the family vault of\\nthe Medici race. Giovanni lies here; Cosimo lies here; and Piero;\\nwhile Lorenzo the Magnificent and Giuliano and certain descendants\\nwere buried in the Michelangelo sacristy, and all the Grand Dukes in\\nthe ostentatious chapel behind the altar.\\n\\nCosimo is buried beneath the floor in front of the high altar,\\nin obedience to his wish, and by the special permission of the\\nRoman Church; and in the same vault lies Donatello. Cosimo, who\\nwas buried with all simplicity on August 22nd, 1464, in his last\\nillness recommended Donatello, who was then seventy-eight, to his son\\nPiero. The old sculptor survived his illustrious patron and friend\\nonly two and a half years, declining gently into the grave, and his\\nbody was brought here in December, 1466. A monument to his memory\\nwas erected in the church in 1896. Piero (the Gouty), who survived\\nuntil 1469, lies close by, his bronze monument, with that of his\\nbrother, being that between the sacristy and the adjoining chapel,\\nin an imposing porphyry and bronze casket, the work of Verrocchio, one\\nof the richest and most impressive of all the memorial sculptures of\\nthe Renaissance. The marble pediment is supported by four tortoises,\\nsuch as support the monoliths in the Piazza S. Maria Novella. The\\niron rope work that divides the sacristy from the chapel is a marvel\\nof workmanship.\\n\\nBut we go too fast: the church before the sacristy, and the glories of\\nthe church are Donatello's. We have seen his cantoria in the Museum of\\nthe Cathedral. Here is another, not so riotous and jocund in spirit,\\nbut in its own way hardly less satisfying. The Museum cantoria has\\nthe wonderful frieze of dancing figures; this is an exercise in\\nmarble intarsia. It has the same row of pillars with little specks\\nof mosaic gold; but its beauty is that of delicate proportions and\\nsoft tones. The cantoria is in the left aisle, in its original place;\\nthe two bronze pulpits are in the nave. These have a double interest\\nas being not only Donatello's work but his latest work. They were\\nincomplete at his death, and were finished by his pupil Bertoldo\\n(1410-1491), and since, as we shall see, Bertoldo became the master of\\nMichelangelo, when he was a lad of fifteen and Bertoldo an old man of\\neighty, these pulpits may be said to form a link between the two great\\nS. Lorenzo sculptors. How fine and free and spirited Bertoldo could\\nbe, alone, we shall see at the Bargello. The S. Lorenzo pulpits are\\nvery difficult to study: nothing wants a stronger light than a bronze\\nrelief, and in Florence students of bronze reliefs are accustomed\\nto it, since the most famous of all -- the Ghiberti doors -- are in the\\nopen air. Only in course of time can one discern the scenes here. The\\nleft pulpit is the finer, for it contains the \\\"Crucifixion\\\" and the\\n\\\"Deposition,\\\" which to me form the most striking of the panels.\\n\\nThe other piece of sculpture in the church itself is a ciborium\\nby Desiderio da Settignano, in the chapel at the end of the\\nright transept -- an exquisite work by this rare and playful and\\ndistinguished hand. It is fitting that Desiderio should be here, for\\nhe was Donatello's favourite pupil. The S. Lorenzo ciborium is wholly\\ncharming, although there is a \\\"Deposition\\\" upon it; the little Boy is\\nadorable; but one sees it with the greatest difficulty owing to the\\ncrowded state of the altar and the dim light. The altar picture in\\nthe Martelli chapel, where the sympathetic Donatello monument (in the\\nsame medium as his \\\"Annunciation\\\" at S. Croce) is found -- on the way to\\nthe Library -- is by Lippo Lippi, and is notable for the pretty Virgin\\nreceiving the angel's news. There is nice colour in the predella.\\n\\nAs I have said in the first chapter, we are too prone to ignore the\\narchitect. We look at the jewels and forget the casket. Brunelleschi is\\na far greater maker of Florence than either Donatello or Michelangelo;\\nbut one thinks of him rather as an abstraction than a man or forgets\\nhim altogether. Yet the S. Lorenzo sacristy is one of the few perfect\\nthings in the world. What most people, however, remember is its tombs,\\nits doors, and its reliefs; the proportions escape them. I think its\\nshallow easy dome beyond description beautiful. Brunelleschi, who had\\nan investigating genius, himself painted the quaint constellations in\\nthe ceiling over the altar. At the Pazzi chapel we shall find similar\\narchitecture; but there extraneous colour was allowed to come in. Here\\nsuch reliefs as were admitted are white too.\\n\\nThe tomb under the great marble and porphyry table in the centre is\\nthat of Giovanni di Bicci, the father, and Piccarda, the mother, of\\nCosimo Pater, and is usually attributed to Buggiano, the adopted son\\nof Brunelleschi, but other authorities give it either to Donatello\\nalone or to Donatello with Michelozzo: both from the evidence of\\nthe design and because it is unlikely that Cosimo would ask any one\\nelse than one of these two friends of his to carry out a commission\\nso near his heart. The table is part of the scheme and not a chance\\ncovering. I think the porphyry centre ought to be movable, so that\\nthe beautiful flying figures on the sarcophagus could be seen. But\\nDonatello's most striking achievement here is the bronze doors, which\\nare at once so simple and so strong and so surprising by the activity\\nof the virile and spirited holy men, all converting each other, thereon\\ndepicted. These doors could not well be more different from Ghiberti's,\\nin the casting of which Donatello assisted; those in such high relief,\\nthese so low; those so fluid and placid, and these so vigorous.\\n\\nDonatello presides over this room (under Brunelleschi). The vivacious,\\nspeaking terra-cotta bust of the young S. Lorenzo on the altar is\\nhis; the altar railing is probably his; the frieze of terra-cotta\\ncherubs may be his; the four low reliefs in the spandrels, which it\\nis so difficult to discern but which photographs prove to be wonderful\\nscenes in the life of S. John the Evangelist -- so like, as one peers up\\nat them, plastic Piranesis, with their fine masonry -- are his. The other\\nreliefs are Donatello's too; but the lavabo in the inner sacristy is\\nVerrocchio's, and Verrocchio's tomb of Piero can never be overlooked\\neven amid such a wealth of the greater master's work.\\n\\nFrom this fascinating room -- fascinating both in itself and in its\\npossessions -- we pass, after distributing the necessary largesse to\\nthe sacristan, to a turnstile which admits, on payment of a lira,\\nto the Chapel of the Princes and to Michelangelo's sacristy. Here is\\ncontrast, indeed: the sacristy, austere and classic, and the chapel\\na very exhibition building of floridity and coloured ornateness,\\ndating from the seventeenth century and not finished yet. In paying\\nthe necessary fee to see these buildings one thinks again what the\\nfeelings of Giovanni and Cosimo and Lorenzo the Magnificent, and\\neven of Cosimo I, all such generous patrons of Florence, would be,\\nif they could see the present feverish collection of lire in their\\nbeautiful city.\\n\\nOf the Chapel of the Princes I have little to say. To pass from\\nMichelangelo's sacristy to this is an error; see it, if see it you\\nmust, first. While the fa\\u00e7ade of S. Lorenzo is still neglected and the\\ncornice of Brunelleschi's dome is still unfinished, this lapidary's\\nshow-room is being completed at a cost of millions of lire. Ever since\\n1888 has the floor been in progress, and there are many years' work\\nyet. An enthusiastic custodian gave me a list of the stones which were\\nused in the designs of the coats of arms of Tuscan cities, of which\\nthat of Fiesole is the most attractive: -- Sicily jasper, French jasper,\\nTuscany jasper, petrified wood, white and yellow, Corsican granite,\\nCorsican jasper, Oriental alabaster, French marble, lapis lazuli,\\nverde antico, African marble, Siena marble, Carrara marble, rose agate,\\nmother of pearl, and coral. The names of the Medici are in porphyry\\nand ivory. It is all very marvellous and occasionally beautiful; but...\\n\\nThis pretentious building was designed by a natural son of Cosimo\\nI in 1604, and was begun as the state mausoleum of the Grand Dukes;\\nand all lie here. All the Grand Duchesses too, save Bianca Capella,\\nwife of Francis I, who was buried none knows where. It is strange to\\nrealize as one stands here that this pavement covers all those ladies,\\nburied in their wonderful clothes. We shall see Eleanor of Toledo,\\nwife of Cosimo I, in Bronzino's famous picture at the Uffizi, in an\\namazing brocaded dress: it is that dress in which she reposes beneath\\nus! They had their jewels too, and each Grand Duke his crown and\\nsceptre; but these, with one or two exceptions, were stolen during\\nthe French occupation of Tuscany, 1801-1814. Only two of the Grand\\nDukes have their statues -- Ferdinand I and Cosimo II -- and the Medici\\nno longer exist in the Florentine memory; and yet the quiet brick\\nfloor is having all this money squandered on it to superimpose costly\\nmarbles which cannot matter to anybody.\\n\\nMichelangelo's chapel, called the New Sacristy, was begun for Leo X\\nand finished for Giulio de' Medici, illegitimate son of the murdered\\nGiuliano and afterwards Pope Clement VII. Brunelleschi's design\\nfor the Old Sacristy was followed but made more severe. This, one\\nwould feel to be the very home of dead princes even if there were no\\nstatues. The only colours are the white of the walls and the brown\\nof the pillars and windows; the dome was to have been painted, but\\nit fortunately escaped.\\n\\nThe contrast between Michelangelo's dome and Brunelleschi's is\\ncomplete -- Brunelleschi's so suave and gentle in its rise, with its\\ngrey lines to help the eye, and this soaring so boldly to its lantern,\\nwith its rigid device of dwindling squares. The odd thing is that\\nwith these two domes to teach him better the designer of the Chapel\\nof the Princes should have indulged in such floridity.\\n\\nSuch is the force of the architecture in the sacristy that one is\\nprofoundly conscious of being in melancholy's most perfect home;\\nand the building is so much a part of Michelangelo's life and it\\ncontains such marvels from his hand that I choose it as a place\\nto tell his story. Michelangelo Buonarroti was born on March 6th,\\n1475, at Caprese, of which town his father was Podest\\u00e0. At that time\\nBrunelleschi had been dead twenty-nine years, Fra Angelico twenty\\nyears, Donatello nine years, Leonardo da Vinci was twenty-three years\\nold, and Raphael was not yet born. Lorenzo the Magnificent had been\\non what was virtually the throne of Florence since 1469 and was a\\nyoung man of twenty-six. For foster-mother the child had the wife\\nof a stone-mason at Settignano, whither the family soon moved, and\\nMichelangelo used to say that it was with her milk that he imbibed\\nthe stone-cutting art. It was from the air too, for Settignano's\\nprincipal industry was sculpture. The village being only three miles\\nfrom Florence, from it the boy could see the city very much as we see\\nit now -- its Duomo, its campanile, with the same attendant spires. He\\nwas sent to Florence to school and intended for either the wool or silk\\ntrade, as so many Florentines were; but displaying artistic ability,\\nhe induced his father to apprentice him, at the age of thirteen, to\\na famous goldsmith and painter of Florence who had a busy atelier -- no\\nother than Domenico Ghirlandaio, who was then a man of thirty-nine.\\n\\nMichelangelo remained with him for three years, and although his\\npower and imagination were already greater than his master's, he\\nlearned much, and would never have made his Sixtine Chapel frescoes\\nwith the ease he did but for this early grounding. For Ghirlandaio,\\nalthough not of the first rank of painters in genius, was pre-eminently\\nthere in thoroughness, while he was good for the boy too in spirit,\\nhaving a large way with him. The first work of Ghirlandaio which\\nthe boy saw in the making was the beautiful \\\"Adoration of the Magi,\\\"\\nin the Church of the Spedale degli Innocenti, completed in 1488, and\\nthe S. Maria Novella frescoes, and it is reasonable to suppose that\\nhe helped with the frescoes in colour grinding, even if he did not,\\nas some have said, paint with his own hand the beggar sitting on the\\nsteps in the scene representing the \\\"Presentation of the Virgin\\\". That\\nhe was already clever with his pencil, we know, for he had made some\\ncaricatures and corrected a drawing or two.\\n\\nThe three years with Ghirlandaio were reduced eventually to one, the\\nboy having the good fortune to be chosen as one of enough promise to be\\nworth instruction, both by precept and example, in the famous Medici\\ngarden. Here he was more at home than in a painting room, for plastic\\nart was his passion, and not only had Lorenzo the Magnificent gathered\\ntogether there many of those masterpieces of ancient sculpture which we\\nshall see at the Uffizi, but Bertoldo, the aged head of this informal\\nschool, was the possessor of a private collection of Donatellos and\\nother Renaissance work of extraordinary beauty and worth. Donatello's\\ninfluence on the boy held long enough for him to make the low relief\\nof the Madonna, much in his style, which is now preserved in the\\nCasa Buonarroti, while the plaque of the battle of the Centaurs and\\nLapithae which is also there shows Bertoldo's influence.\\n\\nThe boy's first encounter with Lorenzo occurred while he was modelling\\nthe head of an aged faun. His magnificent patron stopped to watch him,\\npointing out that so old a creature would probably not have such a\\nfine set of teeth, and Michelangelo, taking the hint, in a moment had\\nnot only knocked out a tooth or two but -- and here his observation\\ntold -- hollowed the gums and cheeks a little in sympathy. Lorenzo\\nwas so pleased with his quickness and skill that he received him\\ninto his house as the companion of his three sons: of Piero, who\\nwas so soon and so disastrously to succeed his father, but was now a\\nhigh-spirited youth; of Giovanni, who, as Pope Leo X many years after,\\nwas to give Michelangelo the commission for this very sacristy; and\\nof Giuliano, who lies beneath one of the tombs. As their companion\\nhe enjoyed the advantage of sharing their lessons under Poliziano,\\nthe poet, and of hearing the conversation of Pico della Mirandola,\\nwho was usually with Lorenzo; and to these early fastidious and\\nintellectual surroundings the artist owed much.\\n\\nThat he read much, we know, the Bible and Dante being constant\\ncompanions; and we know also that in addition to modelling and copying\\nunder Bertoldo, he was assiduous in studying Masaccio's frescoes at\\nthe church of the Carmine across the river, which had become a school\\nof painting. It was there that his fellow-pupil, Pietro Torrigiano,\\nwho was always his enemy and a bully, broke his nose with one blow\\nand flew to Rome from the rage of Lorenzo.\\n\\nIt was when Michelangelo was seventeen that Lorenzo died, at the early\\nage of forty-two, and although the garden still existed and the Medici\\npalace was still open to the youth, the spirit had passed. Piero, who\\nsucceeded his father, had none of his ability or sagacity, and in two\\nyears was a refugee from the city, while the treasures of the garden\\nwere disposed by auction, and Michelangelo, too conspicuous as a Medici\\nprot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 to be safe, hurried away to Bologna. He was now nineteen.\\n\\nOf his travels I say nothing here, for we must keep to Florence,\\nwhither he thought it safe to return in 1495. The city was now governed\\nby the Great Council and the Medici banished. Michelangelo remained\\nonly a brief time and then went to Rome, where he made his first Piet\\u00e0,\\nat which he was working during the trial and execution of Savonarola,\\nwhom he admired and reverenced, and where he remained until 1501,\\nwhen, aged twenty-six, he returned to Florence to do some of his most\\nfamous work. The Medici were still in exile.\\n\\nIt was in August, 1501, that the authorities of the cathedral asked\\nMichelangelo to do what he could with a great block of marble on\\ntheir hands, from which he carved that statue of David of which I\\ntell the story in chapter XVI. This established his pre-eminence as\\na sculptor. Other commissions for statues poured in, and in 1504 he\\nwas invited to design a cartoon for the Palazzo Vecchio, to accompany\\none by Leonardo, and a studio was given him in the Via Guelfa for\\nthe purpose. This cartoon, when finished, so far established him\\nalso as the greatest of painters that the Masaccios in the Carmine\\nwere deserted by young artists in order that this might be studied\\ninstead. The cartoon, as I relate in the chapter on the Palazzo\\nVecchio, no longer exists.\\n\\nThe next year, 1505, Michelangelo, nearing his thirtieth birthday,\\nreturned to Rome and entered upon the second and tragic period of his\\nlife, for he arrived there only to receive the order for the Julius\\ntomb which poisoned his remaining years, and of which more is said\\nin the chapter on the Accademia, where we see so many vestiges of it\\nboth in marble and plaster. But I might remark here that this vain\\nand capricious pontiff, whose pride and indecision robbed the world\\nof no one can ever say what glorious work from Michelangelo's hand,\\nis the benevolent-looking old man whose portrait by Raphael is in\\nthe Pitti and Uffizi in colour, in the Corsini Palace in charcoal,\\nand again in our own National Gallery in colour.\\n\\nOf Michelangelo at Rome and Carrara, whither he went to superintend\\nin person the quarrying of the marble that was to be transferred to\\nlife and where he had endless vexations and mortifications, I say\\nnothing. Enough that the election of his boy friend Giovanni de'\\nMedici as Pope Leo X in 1513 brought him again to Florence, the Pope\\nhaving a strong wish that Michelangelo should complete the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nthe Medici family church, S. Lorenzo, where we now are. As we know,\\nthe scheme was not carried out, but in 1520 the Pope substituted\\nanother and more attractive one: namely, a chapel to contain the\\ntombs not only of his father the Magnificent, and his uncle, who had\\nbeen murdered in the Duomo many years before, but also his nephew\\nPiero de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, who had just died, in 1519, and\\nhis younger brother (and Michelangelo's early playmate) Giuliano de'\\nMedici, Duke of Nemours, who had died in 1516. These were not Medici\\nof the highest class, but family pride was strong. It is, however,\\nodd that no memorial of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici, who had been\\ndrowned at the age of twenty-two in 1503, was required; perhaps it\\nmay have been that since it was Piero's folly that had brought the\\nMedici into such disgrace in 1494, the less thought of him the better.\\n\\nMichelangelo took fire at once, and again hastened to Carrara to\\narrange for marble to be sent to his studio in the Via Mozzi, now the\\nVia S. Zenobi; while the building stone was brought from Fiesole. Leo\\nX lived only to know that the great man had begun, the new patron\\nbeing Giulio de' Medici, natural son of the murdered Giuliano,\\nnow a cardinal, and soon, in 1523, to become Pope Clement VII. This\\nPope showed deep interest in the project, but wished not only to add\\ntombs of himself and Pope Leo X, but also to build a library for the\\nLaurentian collection, which Michelangelo must design. A little later\\nhe had decided that he would prefer to lie in the choir of the church,\\nand Leo X with him, and instead therefore of tombs Michelangelo might\\nmerely make a colossal statue of him to stand in the piazza before the\\nchurch. The sculptor's temper had not been improved by his many years'\\nexperience of papal caprice, and he replied to this suggestion with\\na letter unique even in the annals of infuriated artists. Let the\\nstatue be made, of course, he said, but let it be useful as well as\\nornamental: the lower portion to be also a barber's shop, and the\\nhead, since it would be empty, a greengrocer's. The Pope allowed\\nhimself to be rebuked, and abandoned the statue, writing a mild and\\neven pathetic reply.\\n\\nUntil 1527 Michelangelo worked away at the building and the tombs,\\nalways secretly, behind impenetrable barriers; and then came the\\ntroubles which led to the siege of Florence, following upon the\\nbanishment of Alessandro, Duke of Urbino, natural son of the very\\nLorenzo whom the sculptor was to dignify for all time. By the Emperor\\nCharles V and Pope Clement VII the city was attacked, and Michelangelo\\nwas called away from Clement's sacristy to fortify Florence against\\nClement's soldiers. Part of his ramparts at S. Miniato still remain,\\nand he strengthened all the gates; but, feeling himself slighted and\\nhating the whole affair, he suddenly disappeared. One story is that he\\nhid in the church tower of S. Niccol\\u00f2, below what is now the Piazzale\\ndedicated to his memory. Wherever he was, he was proclaimed an outlaw,\\nand then, on Florence finding that she could not do without him,\\nwas pardoned, and so returned, the city meanwhile having surrendered\\nand the Medici again being restored to power.\\n\\nThe Pope showed either fine magnanimity or compounded with facts\\nin the interest of the sacristy; for he encouraged Michelangelo to\\nproceed, and the pacific work was taken up once more after the martial\\ninterregnum, and in a desultory way he was busy at it, always secretly\\nand moodily, until 1533, when he tired completely and never touched\\nit again. A year later Clement VII died, having seen only drawings\\nof the tombs, if those.\\n\\nBut though left unfinished, the sacristy is wholly satisfying -- more\\nindeed than satisfying, conquering. Whatever help Michelangelo may\\nhave had from his assistants, it is known that the symbolical figures\\non the tombs and the two seated Medici are from his hand. Of the two\\nfinished or practically finished tombs -- to my mind as finished as they\\nshould be -- that of Lorenzo is the finer. The presentment of Lorenzo in\\narmour brooding and planning is more splendid than that of Giuliano;\\nwhile the old man, whose head anticipates everything that is considered\\nmost original in Rodin's work, is among the best of Michelangelo's\\nstatuary. Much speculation has been indulged in as to the meaning\\nof the symbolism of these tombs, and having no theory of my own to\\noffer, I am glad to borrow Mr. Gerald S. Davies' summary from his\\nmonograph on Michelangelo. The figure of Giuliano typifies energy\\nand leadership in repose; while the man on his tomb typifies Day and\\nthe woman Night, or the man Action and the woman the sleep and rest\\nthat produce Action. The figure of Lorenzo typifies Contemplation,\\nthe woman Dawn, and the man Twilight, the states which lie between\\nlight and darkness, action and rest. What Michelangelo -- who owed\\nnothing to any Medici save only Lorenzo the Magnificent and had seen\\nthe best years of his life frittered away in the service of them and\\nother proud princes -- may also have intended we shall never know; but\\nhe was a saturnine man with a long memory, and he might easily have\\nmade the tombs a vehicle for criticism. One would not have another\\ntouch of the chisel on either of the symbolical male figures.\\n\\nAlthough a tomb to Lorenzo the Magnificent by Michelangelo would\\nsurely have been a wonderful thing, there is something startling and\\narresting in the circumstance that he has none at all from any hand,\\nbut lies here unrecorded. His grandfather, in the church itself,\\nrests beneath a plain slab, which aimed so consciously at modesty\\nas thereby to achieve special distinction: Lorenzo, leaving no such\\ndirections, has nothing, while in the same room are monuments to\\ntwo common-place descendants to thrill the soul. The disparity is in\\nitself monumental. That Michelangelo's Madonna and Child are on the\\nslab which covers the dust of Lorenzo and his brother is a chance. The\\nsaints on either side are S. Cosimo and S. Damian, the patron saints\\nof old Cosimo de' Medici, and are by Michelangelo's assistants. The\\nMadonna was intended for the altar of the sacristy. Into this work the\\nsculptor put much of his melancholy and, one feels, disappointment. The\\nface of the Madonna is already sad and hopeless; but the Child is\\nperhaps the most splendid and determined of any in all Renaissance\\nsculpture. He may, if we like, symbolize the new generation that is\\nalways deriving sustenance from the old, without care or thought of\\nwhat the old has to suffer; he crushes his head against his mother's\\nbreast in a very passion of vigorous dependence. \\n\\nWhatever was originally intended, it is certain that in Michelangelo's\\nsacristy disillusionment reigns as well as death. But how beautiful\\nit is!\\n\\nIn a little room leading from the sacristy I was shown by a smiling\\ncustodian Lorenzo the Magnificent's coffin, crumbling away, and\\nphotographs of the skulls of the two brothers: Giuliano's with one\\nof Francesco de' Pazzi's dagger wounds in it, and Lorenzo's, ghastly\\nin its decay. I gave the man half a lira.\\n\\nWhile he was working on the tombs Michelangelo had undertaken now and\\nthen a small commission, and to this period belongs the David which we\\nshall see in the little room on the ground floor of the Bargello. In\\n1534, when he finally abandoned the sacristy, and, leaving Florence for\\never, settled in Rome, the Laurentian library was only begun, and he\\nhad little interest in it. He never saw it again. At Rome his time was\\nfully occupied in painting the \\\"Last Judgment\\\" in the Sixtine Chapel,\\nand in various architectural works. But Florence at any rate has two\\nmarble masterpieces that belong to the later period -- the Brutus in\\nthe Bargello and the Piet\\u00e0 in the Duomo, which we have seen -- that\\npoignantly impressive rendering of the entombment upon which the old\\nman was at work when he died, and which he meant for his own grave.\\n\\nHis death came in 1564, on February 23rd, when he was nearly\\neighty-nine, and his body was brought to Florence and buried amid\\nuniversal grief in S. Croce, where it has a florid monument.\\n\\nSince we are considering the life of Michelangelo, I might perhaps\\nsay here a few words about his house, which is only a few minutes'\\ndistant -- at No. 64 Via Ghibellina -- where certain early works and\\npersonal relics are preserved. Michelangelo gave the house to his\\nnephew Leonardo; it was decorated early in the seventeenth century with\\nscenes in the life of the master, and finally bequeathed to the city\\nas a heritage in 1858. It is perhaps the best example of the rapacity\\nof the Florentines; for notwithstanding that it was left freely in\\nthis way a lira is charged for admission. The house contains more\\ncollateral curiosities, as they might be called, than those in the\\ndirect line; but there are architectural drawings from the wonderful\\nhand, colour drawings of a Madonna, a few studies, and two early pieces\\nof sculpture -- the battle of the Lapithae and Centaurs, a relief marked\\nby tremendous vigour and full of movement, and a Madonna and Child,\\nalso in relief, with many marks of greatness upon it. In a recess\\nin Room IV are some personal relics of the artist, which his great\\nnephew, the poet, who was named after him, began to collect early in\\nthe seventeenth century. As a whole the house is disappointing.\\n\\nUpstairs have been arranged a quantity of prints and drawings\\nillustrating the history of Florence.\\n\\nThe S. Lorenzo cloisters may be entered either from a side door in\\nthe church close to the Old Sacristy or from the piazza. Although an\\nofficial in uniform keeps the piazza door, they are free. Brunelleschi\\nis again the architect, and from the loggia at the entrance to the\\nlibrary you see most acceptably the whole of his cathedral dome and\\nhalf of Giotto's tower. It is impossible for Florentine cloisters -- or\\nindeed any cloisters -- not to have a certain beauty, and these are\\nunusually charming and light, seen both from the loggia and the ground.\\n\\nMichelangelo's Biblioteca Laurenziana, which leads from them,\\nis one of the most perfect of sombre buildings, the very home of\\nwell-ordered scholarship. The staircase is impressive, although perhaps\\na little too severe; the long room could not be more satisfying to\\nthe eye. Michelangelo died before it was finished, but it is his in\\ndesign, even to the ceiling and cases for MSS. in which the library\\nis so rich, and the rich red wood ceiling. Vasari, Michelangelo's\\npupil and friend and the biographer to whom we are so much indebted,\\ncarried on the work. His scheme of windows has been upset on the\\nside opposite the cloisters by the recent addition of a rotunda\\nleading from the main room. If ever rectangular windows were more\\nexquisitely and nobly proportioned I should like to see them. The\\nlibrary is free for students, and the attendants are very good in\\ncalling stray visitors' attention to illuminated missals, old MSS.,\\nearly books and so forth. One of Galileo's fingers, stolen from his\\nbody, used to be kept here, in a glass case, and may be here still;\\nbut I did not see it. I saw, however, the portraits, in an old volume,\\nof Petrarch and his Laura.\\n\\nThis wonderful collection was begun by Cosimo de' Medici; others\\nadded to it until it became one of the most valuable in the world,\\nnot, however, without various vicissitudes incident to any Florentine\\ninstitution: while one of its most cherished treasures, the Virgil\\nof the fourth or fifth century, was even carried to Paris by Napoleon\\nand not returned until the great year of restoration, 1816. Among the\\nholograph MSS. is Cellini's \\\"Autobiography\\\". The library, in time,\\nafter being confiscated by the Republic and sold to the monks of\\nS. Marco, again passed into the possession of a Medici, Leo X, son\\nof Lorenzo the Magnificent, and then of Clement VII, and he it was\\nwho commissioned Michelangelo to house it with dignity.\\n\\nAn old daily custom in the cloisters of S. Lorenzo was the feeding of\\ncats; but it has long since been dropped. If you look at Mr. Hewlett's\\n\\\"Earthwork out of Tuscany\\\" you will find an entertaining description\\nof what it used to be like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nOr San Michele and the Palazzo Vecchio\\n\\nThe little Bigallo -- The Misericordia -- Or San Michele -- Andrea\\nOrcagna -- The Tabernacle -- Old Glass -- A company of stone\\nsaints -- Donatello's S. George -- Dante conferences -- The Guilds of\\nFlorence -- The Palazzo Vecchio -- Two Towers -- Bandinelli's group -- The\\nMarzocco -- The Piazza della Signoria -- Orcagna's Loggia -- Cellini\\nand Cosimo -- The Perseus -- Verrocchio's dolphin -- The Great Council\\nHall -- Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's cartoons -- Bandinelli's\\nmalice -- The Palazzo Vecchio as a home -- Two cells and the bell of\\nindependence.\\n\\nLet us now proceed along the Via Calzaioli (which means street of\\nthe stocking-makers), running away from the Piazza del Duomo to\\nthe Piazza della Signoria. The fascinatingly pretty building at\\nthe corner, opposite Pisano's Baptistery doors, is the Bigallo,\\nin the loggia of which foundling children used to be displayed in\\nthe hope that passers-by might pity them sufficiently to make them\\npresents or even adopt them; but this custom continues no longer. The\\nBigallo was designed, it is thought, by Orcagna, and it is worth the\\nminutest study.\\n\\nThe Company of the Bigallo, which is no longer an active force, was\\none of the benevolent societies of old Florence. But the greatest\\nof these societies, still busy and merciful, is the Misericordia,\\nwhose head-quarters are just across the Via Calzaioli, in the piazza,\\nfacing the campanile, a company of Florentines pledged at a moment's\\nnotice, no matter on what they may be engaged, to assist in any\\ncharitable work of necessity. For the most part they carry ambulances\\nto the scenes of accident and perform the last offices for the dead\\nin the poorer districts. When on duty they wear black robes and\\nhoods. Their headquarters comprise a chapel, with an altar by Andrea\\ndella Robbia, and a statue of the patron saint of the Misericordia,\\nS. Sebastian. But their real patron saint is their founder, a common\\nporter named Pietro Borsi. In the thirteenth century it was the custom\\nfor the porters and loafers connected with the old market to meet\\nin a shelter here and pass the time away as best they could. Borsi,\\njoining them, was distressed to find how unprofitable were the hours,\\nand he suggested the formation of a society to be of some real use,\\nthe money to support it to be obtained by fines in payment for oaths\\nand blasphemies. A litter or two were soon bought and the machinery\\nstarted. The name was the Company of the Brothers of Mercy. That was\\nin 1240 to 1250. To-day no Florentine is too grand to take his part,\\nand at the head of the porter's band of brethren is the King.\\n\\nPassing along the Via Calzaioli we come on the right to a noble square\\nbuilding with statues in its niches -- Or San Michele, which stands on\\nthe site of the chapel of San Michele in Orto. San Michele in Orto,\\nor more probably in Horreo (meaning either in the garden or in the\\ngranary), was once part of a loggia used as a corn market, in which\\nwas preserved a picture by Ugolino da Siena representing the Virgin,\\nand this picture had the power of working miracles. Early in the\\nfourteenth century the loggia was burned down but the picture was\\nsaved (or quickly replaced), and a new building on a much larger and\\nmore splendid scale was made for it, none other than Or San Michele,\\nthe chief architect being Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's pupil and later\\nthe constructor of the Ponte Vecchio. Where the picture then was, I\\ncannot say -- whether inside the building or out -- but the principal use\\nof the building was to serve as a granary. After 1348, when Florence\\nwas visited by that ravaging plague which Boccaccio describes in\\nsuch gruesome detail at the beginning of the \\\"Decameron\\\" and which\\nsent his gay company of ladies and gentlemen to the Villa Palmieri\\nto take refuge in story telling, and when this sacred picture was\\nmore than commonly busy and efficacious, it was decided to apply\\nthe enormous sums of money given to the shrine from gratitude in\\nbeautifying the church still more, and chiefly in providing a casket\\nworthy of holding such a pictorial treasure. Hence came about the\\nnoble edifice of to-day.\\n\\nA man of universal genius was called in to execute the tabernacle:\\nAndrea Orcagna, a pupil probably of Andrea Pisano, and also much\\ninfluenced by Giotto, whom though he had not known he idolized,\\nand one who, like Michelangelo later, was not only a painter and\\nsculptor but an architect and a poet. Orcagna, or, to give him his\\nright name, Andrea di Cione, for Orcagna was an abbreviation of\\nArcagnolo, flourished in the middle of the fourteenth century. Among\\nhis best-known works in painting are the Dantesque frescoes in the\\nStrozzi chapel at S. Maria Novella, and that terrible allegory of\\nDeath and Judgment in the Campo Santo at Pisa, in which the gay riding\\nparty come upon the three open graves. Orcagna put all his strength\\ninto the tabernacle of Or San Michele, which is a most sumptuous,\\nbeautiful and thoughtful shrine, yet owing to the darkness of the\\nchurch is almost invisible. Guides, it is true, will emerge from the\\ngloom and hold lighted tapers to it, but a right conception of it is\\nimpossible. The famous miraculous picture over the altar is notable\\nrather for its properties than for its intrinsic beauty; it is the\\npanels of the altar, which contain Orcagna's most exquisite work,\\nrepresenting scenes in the life of the Virgin, with emblematical\\nfigures interspersed, that one wishes to see. Only the back, however,\\ncan be seen really well, and this only when a door opposite to it -- in\\nthe Via Calzaioli -- is opened. It should always be open, with a grille\\nacross it, that passers-by might have constant sight of this almost\\nunknown Florentine treasure. It is in the relief of the death of the\\nVirgin on the back that -- on the extreme right -- Orcagna introduced\\nhis own portrait. The marble employed is of a delicate softness, and\\nOrcagna had enough of Giotto's tradition to make the Virgin a reality\\nand to interest Her, for example, as a mother in the washing of Her\\nBaby, as few painters have done, and in particular, as, according\\nto Ruskin, poor Ghirlandaio could not do in his fresco of the birth\\nof the Virgin Herself. It was Orcagna's habit to sign his sculpture\\n\\\"Andrea di Cione, painter,\\\" and his paintings \\\"Andrea di Cione,\\nsculptor,\\\" and thus point his versatility. By this tabernacle, by\\nhis Pisan fresco, and by the designs of the Loggia de' Lanzi and the\\nBigallo (which are usually given to him), he takes his place among\\nthe most interesting and various of the forerunners of the Renaissance.\\n\\nWithin Or San Michele you learn the secret of the stoned-up windows\\nwhich one sees with regret from without. Each, or nearly each, has\\nan altar against it. What the old glass was like one can divine from\\nthe lovely and sombre top lights in exquisite patterns that are left;\\nthat on the centre of the right wall of the church, as one enters,\\nhaving jewels of green glass as lovely as any I ever saw. But blues,\\npurples, and reds predominate.\\n\\nThe tabernacle apart, the main appeal of Or San Michele is the statuary\\nand stone-work of the exterior; for here we find the early masters\\nat their best. The building being the head-quarters of the twelve\\nFlorentine guilds, the statues and decorations were commissioned by\\nthem. It is as though our City companies should unite in beautifying\\nthe Guildhall. Donatello is the greatest artist here, and it was\\nfor the Armourers that he made his S. George, which stands now, as\\nhe carved it in marble, in the Bargello, but has a bronze substitute\\nin its original niche, below which is a relief of the slaying of the\\ndragon from Donatello's chisel. Of this glorious S. George more will\\nbe said later. But I may remark now that in its place here it instantly\\nproves the modernity and realistic vigour of its sculptor. Fine though\\nthey be, all the other statues of this building are conventional;\\nthey carry on a tradition of religious sculpture such as Niccol\\u00f2\\nPisano respected, many years earlier, when he worked at the Pisan\\npulpit. But Donatello's S. George is new and is as beautiful as a\\nGreek god, with something of real human life added.\\n\\nDonatello (with Michelozzo) also made the exquisite border of the\\nniche in the Via Calzaioli fa\\u00e7ade, in which Christ and S. Thomas now\\nstand. He was also to have made the figures (for the Merchants' Guild)\\nbut was busy elsewhere, and they fell to Verrocchio, of whom also we\\nshall have much to see and say at the Bargello, and to my mind they\\nare the most beautiful of all. The John the Baptist (made for the\\nCloth-dealers), also on this fa\\u00e7ade, is by Ghiberti of the Baptistery\\ngates. On the fa\\u00e7ade of the Via de' Lamberti is Donatello's superb\\nS. Mark (for the Joiners), which led to Michelangelo's criticism that\\nhe had never seen a man who looked more virtuous, and if S. Mark\\nwere really like that he would believe all his words. \\\"Why don't\\nyou speak to me?\\\" he also said to this statue, as Donatello had\\nsaid to the Zuccone. Higher on this fa\\u00e7ade is Luca della Robbia's\\nfamous arms of the Silk-weavers, one of the perfect things. Luca\\nalso made the arms of the Guild of Merchants, with its Florentine\\nfleur-de-lis in the midst. For the rest, Ghiberti's S. Stephen,\\nand Ghiberti and Michelozzo's S. Matthew, on the entrance wall,\\nare the most remarkable. The blacksmith relief is very lively and\\nthe blacksmith's saint a noble figure.\\n\\nThe little square reliefs let into the wall at intervals\\nare often charming, and the stone-work of the windows is very\\nlovely. In fact, the four walls of this fortress church are almost\\ninexhaustible. Within, its vaulted roof is so noble, its proportions\\nso satisfying. One should often sit quietly here, in the gloom,\\nand do nothing.\\n\\nThe little building just across the way was the Guild House of the\\nArte della Lana, or Wool-combers, and is now the head-quarters of\\nthe Italian Dante Society, who hold a conference every Thursday\\nin the large room over Or San Michele, gained by the flying\\nbuttress-bridge. The dark picture on the outer wall is the very\\nMadonna to which, when its position was at the Mercato Vecchio,\\ncondemned criminals used to pray on their way to execution.\\n\\nBefore we leave Or San Michele and the Arte della Lana, a word on\\nthe guilds of Florence is necessary, for at a period in Florentine\\nhistory between, say, the middle of the thirteenth century and the\\nbeginning of the fifteenth, they were the very powerful controllers\\nof the domestic affairs of the city; and it is possible that it would\\nhave been better for the Florentines had they continued to be so. For\\nFlorence was essentially mercantile and the guilds were composed of\\nbusiness men; and it is natural that business men should know better\\nthan noblemen what a business city needed. They were divided into\\nmajor guilds, chief of which were the woollen merchants -- the Arte\\ndella Lana -- and the silk merchants -- the Calimala -- and it was their\\npride to put their riches at the city's service. Thus, the Arte della\\nLana had charge of the building of the cathedral. Each of the major\\nguilds provided a Prior, and the Priors elected the Signoria, who\\ngoverned the city. It is one of the principal charges that is brought\\nagainst Cosimo de' Medici that he broke the power of the guilds.\\n\\nReturning to the Via Calzaioli, and turning to the right, we come\\nvery quickly to the Piazza della Signoria, and see before us,\\ndiagonally across it, the Loggia de' Lanzi and the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nwith the gleaming, gigantic figure of Michelangelo's David against\\nthe dark gateway. This, more than the Piazza del Duomo, is the centre\\nof Florence.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Vecchio was for centuries called the Signoria, being the\\nhome of the Gonfalonier of Florence and the Signoria who assisted\\nhis councils. It was begun by Arnolfo, the architect of the Duomo and\\nS. Croce, at the end of the thirteenth century, that being, as we have\\nseen, a period of great prosperity and ambition in Florence, but many\\nalterations and additions were made -- by Michelozzo, Cronaca, Vasari,\\nand others -- to bring it to what it now is. After being the scene\\nof many riots, executions, and much political strife and dubiety,\\nit became a ducal palace in 1532, and is now a civic building and\\nshow-place. In the old days the Palazzo had a ringhiera, or platform,\\nin front of it, from which proclamations were made. To know what\\nthis was like one has but to go to S. Trinit\\u00e0 on a very fine morning\\nand look at Ghirlandaio's fresco of the granting of the charter to\\nS. Francis. The scene, painted in 1485, includes not only the Signoria\\nbut the Loggia de' Lanzi (then the Loggia dell' Orcagna) -- both before\\nany statues were set up.\\n\\nEvery fa\\u00e7ade of the Palazzo Vecchio is splendid. I cannot say which\\nI admire more -- that which one sees from the Loggia de' Lanzi, with\\nits beautiful coping of corbels, at once so heavy and so light, with\\ncoloured escutcheons between them, or that in the Via de' Gondi, with\\nits fine jumble of old brickwork among the stones. The Palazzo Vecchio\\nis one of the most resolute and independent buildings in the world;\\nand it had need to be strong, for the waves of Florentine revolt were\\nalways breaking against it. The tower rising from this square fortress\\nhas at once grace and strength and presents a complete contrast to\\nGiotto's campanile; for Giotto's campanile is so light and delicate and\\nreasonable and this tower of the Signoria so stern and noble. There\\nis a difference as between a beautiful woman and a powerful man. In\\nthe functions of the two towers -- the dominating towers of Florence -- is\\na wide difference also, for the campanile calls to prayer, while for\\nyears the sombre notes of the great Signoria bell -- the Vacca -- rang out\\nonly to bid the citizens to conclave or battle or to sound an alarm.\\n\\nIt was this Vacca wich (with others) the brave Piero Capponi\\nthreatened to ring when Charles VIII wished, in 1494, to force a\\ndisgraceful treaty on the city. The scene was the Medici Palace in\\nthe Via Larga. The paper was ready for signature and Capponi would\\nnot sign. \\\"Then I must bid my trumpets blow,\\\" said Charles. \\\"If you\\nsound your trumpets,\\\" Capponi replied, \\\"we will ring our bells;\\\"\\nand the King gave way, for he knew that his men had no chance in this\\ncity if it rose suddenly against them.\\n\\nBut the glory of the Palazzo Vecchio tower -- afer its proportions -- is\\nthat brilliant inspiration of the architect which led him, so to\\nspeak, to begin again by setting the four columns on the top of the\\nsolid portion. These pillars are indescribably right: so solid\\nand yet so light, so powerful and yet so comely. Their duty was\\nto support the bells, and particularly the Vacca, when he rocked\\nhis gigantic weight of green bronze to and fro to warn the city.\\nSeen from a distance the columns are always beautiful; seen close\\nby they are each a tower of comfortable strength. And how the wind\\nblows through them from the Apennines!\\n\\nThe David on the left of the Palazzo Vecchio main door is only a copy.\\nThe original stood there until 1873, when, after three hundred and\\nsixty-nine years, it was moved to a covered spot in the Accademia,\\nas we shall there see and learn its history. If we want to know what\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio looked like at the time David was placed there,\\na picture by Piero di Cosimo in our National Gallery tells us, for\\nhe makes it the background of his portrait of Ferrucci, No. 895.\\n\\nThe group on the right represents Hercules and Cacus, and\\nis by Baccio Bandinelli (1485-1560), a coarse and offensive man,\\njealous of most people and particularly of Michelangelo, to whom,\\nbut for his displeasing Pope Clement VII, the block of marble from\\nwhich the Hercules was carved would have been given. Bandinelli in\\nhis delight at obtaining it vowed to surpass that master's David,\\nand those who want to know what Florence thought of his effort should\\nconsult the amusing and malicious pages of Cellini's Autobiography.\\nOn its way to Bandinelli's studio the block fell into the Arrio, and\\nit was a joke of the time that it had drowned itself to avoid its fate\\nat the sculptor's hands. Even after he had half done it, there was a\\nmoment when Michelangelo had an opportunity of taking over the stone\\nand turning it into a Samson, but the siege of Florence intervened,\\nand eventually Bandinelli had his way and the hideous thing now on\\nview was evolved.\\n\\nThe lion at the left end of the fa\\u00e7ade is also a copy, the original\\nby Donatello being in the Bargello, close by; but the pedestal is\\nDonatello's original. This lion is the Marzocco, the legendary guardian\\nof the Florentine republic, and it stood here for four centuries and\\nmore, superseding one which was kissed as a sign of submission by\\nthousands of Pisan prisoners in 1364. The Florentine fleur-de-lis on\\nthe pediment is very beautiful. The same lion may be seen in iron on\\nhis staff at the top of the Palazzo Vecchio tower, and again on the\\nBargello, bravely flourishing his lily against the sky.\\n\\nThe great fountain with its bronze figures at this corner is by\\nBartolommeo Ammanati, a pupil of Bandinelli, and the statue of Cosimo\\nI is by Gian Bologna, who was the best of the post-Michelangelo\\nsculptors and did much good work in Florence, as we shall see at the\\nBargello and in the Boboli Gardens. He studied under Michelangelo\\nin Rome. Though born a Fleming and called a Florentine, his great\\nfountain at Bologna, which is really a fine thing, has identified his\\nfame with that city. Had not Ammanati's design better pleased Cosimo\\nI, the Bologna fountain would be here, for it was designed for this\\npiazza. Gian's best-known work is the Flying Mercury in the Bargello,\\nwhich we have seen, on mantelpieces and in shop windows, everywhere;\\nbut what is considered his masterpiece is over there, in the Loggia de'\\nLanzi, the very beautiful building on the right of the Palazzo, the\\n\\\"Rape of the Sabines,\\\" a group which, to me, gives no pleasure. The\\nbronze reliefs under the Cosimo statue -- this Cosimo being, of course,\\nfar other than Cosimo de' Medici, Father of his Country: Cosimo\\nI of Tuscany, who insisted upon a crown and reigned from 1537 to\\n1575 -- represents his assumption of rule on the death of Alessandro in\\n1537; his triumphant entry into Siena when he conquered it and absorbed\\nit; and his reception of the rank of Grand Duke. Of Cosimo (whom we\\nmet in Chapter V) more will be said when we enter the Palazzo Vecchio.\\n\\nBetween this statue and the Loggia de' Lanzi is a bronze tablet let\\ninto the paving which tells us that it was on this very spot, in 1498,\\nthat Savonarola and two of his companions were put to death. The\\nancient palace on the Duomo side of the piazza is attributed in\\ndesign to Raphael, who, like most of the great artists of his time,\\nwas also an architect and was the designer of the Palazzo Pandolfini\\nin the Via San Gallo, No. 74. The Palazzo we are now admiring for\\nits blend of massiveness and beauty is the Uguccione, and anybody\\nwho wishes may probably have a whole floor of it to-day for a few\\nshillings a week. The building which completes the piazza on the\\nright of us, with coats of arms on its fa\\u00e7ade, is now given to the\\nBoard of Agriculture and has been recently restored. It was once\\na Court of Justice. The great building at the opposite side of the\\npiazza, where the trams start, is a good example of modern Florentine\\narchitecture based on the old: the Palazzo Landi, built in 1871 and\\nnow chiefly an insurance office. In London we have a more attractive\\nthough smaller derivative of the great days of Florentine building,\\nin Standen's wool shop in Jermyn Street.\\n\\nThe Piazza della Signoria has such riches that one is in danger of\\nneglecting some. The Palazzo Vecchio, for example, so overpowers\\nthe Loggia de' Lanzi in size as to draw the eye from that perfect\\nstructure. One should not allow this to happen; one should let\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio's solid nobility wait awhile and concentrate\\non the beauty of Orcagna's three arches. Coming so freshly from his\\ntabernacle in Or San Michele we are again reminded of the versatility\\nof the early artists.\\n\\nThis structure, originally called the Loggia de' Priori or Loggia\\nd'Orcagna, was built in the fourteenth century as an open place for\\nthe delivery of proclamations and for other ceremonies, and also as\\na shelter from the rain, the last being a purpose it still serves. It\\nwas here that Savonarola's ordeal by fire would have had place had it\\nnot been frustrated. Vasari also gives Orcagna the four symbolical\\nfigures in the recesses in the spandrels of the arches. The Loggia,\\nwhich took its new name from the Swiss lancers, or lanzi, that Cosimo\\nI kept there -- he being a fearful ruler and never comfortable without a\\nbodyguard -- is now a recognized place of siesta; and hither many people\\ncarry their poste-restante correspondence from the neighbouring post\\noffice in the Uffizi to read in comfort. A barometer and thermometer\\nare almost the only novelties that a visitor from the sixteenth\\ncentury would notice.\\n\\nThe statuary is both old and new; for here are genuine antiques once\\nin Ferdinand I's Villa Medici at Rome, and such modern masterpieces\\nas Donatello's Judith and Holofernes, Cellini's Perseus, and Gian\\nBologna's two muscular and restless groups. The best of the antiques\\nis the Woman Mourning, the fourth from the end on the left, which is\\na superb creation.\\n\\nDonatello's Judith, which gives me less pleasure than any of his work,\\nboth in the statue and in the relief, was commissioned for Cosimo\\nde' Medici, who placed it in the courtyard or garden of the Medici\\npalace -- Judith, like David, by her brave action against a tyrant,\\nbeing a champion of the Florentine republic. In 1495, after Cosimo's\\nworthless grandson Piero de' Medici had been expelled from Florence\\nand the Medici palace sacked, the statue was moved to the front of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, where the David now is, and an inscription placed\\non it describing it as a warning to all enemies of liberty. This\\nposition being needed for Michelangelo's David, in 1506, Judith was\\nmoved to the Loggia to the place where the Sabine group now is. In\\n1560 it took up its present position.\\n\\nCellini's Perseus will not quite do, I think, after Donatello and\\nVerrocchio; but few bronzes are more famous, and certainly of none\\nhas so vivacious and exciting a story been written as Cellini's own,\\nsetting forth his disappointments, mortifications, and pride in\\nconnexion with this statue. Cellini, whatever one may think of his\\nveracity, is a diverting and valuable writer, and the picture of\\nCosimo I which he draws for us is probably very near the truth. We\\nsee him haughty, familiar, capricious, vain, impulsive, clear-sighted,\\nand easily flattered; intensely pleased to be in a position to command\\nthe services of artists and very unwilling to pay. Cellini was a blend\\nof lackey, child, and genius. He left Francis I in order to serve\\nCosimo and never ceased to regret the change. The Perseus was his\\ngreatest accomplishment for Cosimo, and the narrative of its casting\\nis terrific and not a little like Dumas. When it was uncovered in its\\npresent position all Florence flocked to the Loggia to praise it; the\\npoets placed commendatory sonnets on the pillars, and the sculptor\\npeacocked up and down in an ecstasy of triumph. Then, however, his\\ntroubles once more began, for Cosimo had the craft to force Cellini\\nto name the price, and we see Cellini in an agony between desire for\\nenough and fear lest if he named enough he would offend his patron.\\n\\nThe whole book is a comedy of vanity and jealousy and Florentine\\nvigour, with Courts as a background. It is good to read it; it is\\ngood, having read it, to study once again the unfevered resolute\\nfeatures of Donatello's S. George. Cellini himself we may see among\\nthe statues under the Uffizi and again in the place of honour (as a\\ngoldsmith) in the centre of the Ponte Vecchio. Looking at the Perseus\\nand remembering Donatello, one realizes that what Cellini wanted was\\ncharacter. He had temperament enough but no character. Perseus is\\nsuperb, commanding, distinguished, and one doesn't care a fig for it.\\n\\nOn entering the Palazzo Vecchio we come instantly to one of the most\\ncharming things in Florence -- Verrocchio's fountain -- which stands\\nin the midst of the courtyard. This adorable work -- a little bronze\\nCupid struggling with a spouting dolphin -- was made for Lorenzo de'\\nMedici's country villa at Careggi and was brought here when the\\npalazzo was refurnished for Francis I, Cosimo I's son and successor,\\nand his bride, Joanna of Austria, in 1565. Nothing could better\\nillustrate the accomplishment and imaginative adaptability of the great\\ncraftsmen of the day than the two works of Verrocchio that we have\\nnow seen: the Christ and S. Thomas at Or San Michele, in Donatello\\nand Michelozzo's niche, and this exquisite fountain splashing water\\nso musically. Notice the rich decorations of the pillars of this\\ncourtyard and the rich colour and power of the pillars themselves. The\\nhalf-obliterated frescoes of Austrian towns on the walls were made to\\nprevent Joanna from being homesick, but were more likely, one would\\nguess, to stimulate that malady. In the left corner is the entrance\\nto the old armoury, now empty, with openings in the walls through\\nwhich pieces might be discharged at various angles on any advancing\\nhost. The groined ceiling could support a pyramid.\\n\\nThe Palazzo Vecchio's ground floor is a series of thoroughfares in\\nwhich people are passing continually amid huge pillars and along\\ndark passages; but our way is up the stone steps immediately to the\\nleft on leaving the courtyard where Verrocchio's child eternally\\nsmiles, for the steps take us to that vast hall designed by Cronaca\\nfor Savonarola's Great Council, which was called into being for the\\ngovernment of Florence after the luckless Piero de' Medici had been\\nbanished in 1494. Here much history was made. As to its structure\\nand its architect, Vasari, who later was called in to restore it,\\nhas a deal to say, but it is too technical for us. It was built\\nby Simone di Pollaiuolo, who was known as Cronaca (the Chronicler)\\nfrom his vivid way of telling his adventures. Cronaca (1454-1508),\\nwho was a personal friend and devotee of Savonarola, drew up his plan\\nin consultation with Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo (although then\\nso young: only nineteen or twenty) and others. Its peculiarity is that\\nit is one of the largest rooms in existence without pillars. From the\\nfoot of the steps to the further wall I make it fifty-eight paces,\\nand thirty wide; and the proportions strike the eye as perfect. The\\nwall behind the steps is not at right angles with the other -- and this\\nmust be as peculiar as the absence of pillars.\\n\\nOnce there were to be paintings here by the greatest of all, for\\nmasters no less than Leonardo and Michelangelo were commissioned to\\ndecorate it, each with a great historical painting: a high honour\\nfor the youthful Michelangelo. The loss of these works is one of\\nthe tragedies of art. Leonardo chose for his subject the battle of\\nAnghiari, an incident of 1440 when the Florentines defeated Piccinino\\nand saved their Republic from the Milanese and Visconti. But both\\nthe cartoon and the fresco have gone for ever, and our sense of loss\\nis not diminished by reading in Leonardo's Thoughts on Painting the\\ndirections which he wrote for the use of artists who proposed to paint\\nbattles: one of the most interesting and exciting pieces of writing in\\nthe literature of art. Michelangelo's work, which never reached the\\nwall of the room, as Leonardo's had done, was completed as a cartoon\\nin 1504 to 1506 in his studio in the hospital of the dyers in Sant'\\nOnofrio, which is now the Via Guelfa. The subject was also military:\\nan incident in the long and bitter struggle between Florence and Pisa,\\nwhen Sir John Hawkwood (then in the pay of the Pisans, before he came\\nover finally to the Florentines) attacked a body of Florentines who\\nwere bathing in the river. The scene gave the young artist scope both\\nfor his power of delineating a spirited incident and for his drawing\\nof the nude, and those who saw it said of this work that it was finer\\nthan anything the painter ever did. While it was in progress all\\nthe young artists came to Sant' Onofrio to study it, as they and its\\ncreator had before flocked to the Carmine, where Masaccio's frescoes\\nhad for three-quarters of a century been object-lessons to students.\\n\\nWhat became of the cartoon is not definitely known, but Vasari's\\nstory is that Bandinelli, the sculptor of the Hercules and Cacus\\noutside the Palazzo, who was one of the most diligent copyists of the\\ncartoon after it was placed in a room in this building, had the key\\nof the door counterfeited, and, obtaining entrance during a moment\\nof tumult, destroyed the picture. The reasons given are: (1, and a\\nvery poor one) that he desired to own the pieces; (2) that he wished\\nto deprive other and rival students of the advantage of copying it;\\n(3) that he wanted Leonardo to be the only painter of the Palazzo to\\nbe considered; and (4, and sufficient) that he hated Michelangelo. At\\nthis time Bandinelli could not have been more than eighteen. Vasari's\\nstory is uncorroborated.\\n\\nLeonardo's battle merely perished, being done in some fugitive medium;\\nand the walls are now covered with the works of Vasari himself\\nand his pupils and do not matter, while the ceiling is a muddle\\nof undistinguished paint. There are many statues which also do not\\nmatter; but at the raised end is Leo X, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent,\\nand the first Medici Pope, and at the other a colossal modern statue\\nof Savonarola, who was in person the dominating influence here for\\nthe years between 1494 and 1497; who is to many the central figure\\nin the history of this building; and whose last night on earth was\\nspent with his companions in this very room. But to him we come in\\nthe chapter on S. Marco.\\n\\nMany rooms in the Palazzo are to be seen only on special occasions,\\nbut the great hall is always accessible. Certain rooms upstairs,\\nmostly with rich red and yellow floors, are also visible daily, all\\ninteresting; but most notable is the Salle de Lys, with its lovely blue\\nwalls of lilies, its glorious ceiling of gold and roses, Ghirlandaio's\\nfresco of S. Zenobius, and the perfect marble doorway containing\\nthe wooden doors of Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano, with the heads\\nof Dante and Petrarch in intarsia. Note the figures of Charity and\\nTemperance in the doorway and the charming youthful Baptist.\\n\\nIn Eleanor of Toledo's dining-room there are some rich and elaborate\\ngreen jugs which I remember very clearly and also the ceiling of her\\nworkroom with its choice of Penelope as the presiding genius. Both\\nEleanor's chapel and that in which Savonarola prayed before his\\nexecution are shown.\\n\\nBut the most popular room of all with visitors -- and quite naturally -- is\\nthe little boudoiresque study of Francis I, with its voluptuous\\nladies on the ceiling and the secret treasure-room leading from it,\\nwhile on the way, just outside the door, is a convenient oubliette\\ninto which to push any inconvenient visitor.\\n\\nThe loggia, which Mr. Morley has painted from the Via Castellani,\\nis also always accessible, and from it one has one of those pleasant\\nviews of warm roofs in which Florence abounds.\\n\\nOne of the most attractive of the smaller rooms usually on view is\\nthat one which leads from the lily-room and contains nothing but\\nmaps of the world: the most decorative things conceivable, next to\\nChinese paintings. Looking naturally for Sussex on the English map,\\nI found Winchelsey, Battel, Rye, Lewes, Sorham, Ar\\u00f4nde, and Cicestra.\\n\\nFrom the map-room a little room is gained where the debates in\\nthe Great Council Hall might be secretly overheard by interested\\neavesdroppers, but in particular by Cosimo I. A part of the cornice\\nhas holes in it for this purppse, but on regaining the hall itself\\nI found that the disparity in the pattern was perfectly evident even\\nto my eye, so that every one in those suspicious days must have been\\naware of the listener.\\n\\nThe tower should certainly be ascended -- not only for the view\\nand to be so near the bells and the pillars, but also for historic\\nassociations. After a little way we come to the cell where Cosimo de'\\nMedici, later to be the Father of his Country, was imprisoned, before\\nthat exile which ended in recall and triumph in 1433. This cell,\\nalthough not exactly \\\"a home from home,\\\" is possible. What is to be\\nsaid of that other, some thousands of steps (as it seems) higher,\\nwhere Savonarola was kept for forty days, varied only by intervals\\nof torture? For Savonarola's cell, which is very near the top, is\\nnothing but a recess in the wall with a door to it. It cannot be\\nmore than five feet wide and eight feet long, with an open loophole\\nto the wind. If a man were here for forty days and then pardoned his\\nlife would be worth very little. A bitter eyrie from which to watch\\nthe city one had risked all to reform. What thoughts must have been\\nhis in that trap! What reviews of policy! What illuminations as to\\nFlorentine character!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nThe Uffizi I: The Building and the Collectors\\n\\nThe growth of a gallery -- Vasari's Passaggio -- Cosimo I -- Francis\\nI -- Ferdinand I -- Ferdinand II -- Cosimo III -- Anna Maria Ludovica de'\\nMedici -- Pietro-Leopoldo -- The statues of the fa\\u00e7ade -- Art, literature,\\narms, science, and learning -- The omissions -- Florentine rapacity -- An\\nantique custom -- Window views -- The Uffizi drawings -- The best picture.\\n\\nThe foreigner should understand at once that any inquiries into the\\nhistory of the Uffizi family -- such as for example yield interesting\\nresults in the case of the Pazzi and the Albizzi -- are doomed to\\nfailure; because Uffizi merely means offices. The Palazzo degli\\nUffizi, or palace of offices, was built by Vasari, the biographer of\\nthe artists, for Cosimo I, who having taken the Signoria, or Palazzo\\nVecchio, for his own home, wished to provide another building for the\\nmunicipal government. It was begun in 1560 and still so far fulfils\\nits original purpose as to contain the general post office, while it\\nalso houses certain Tuscan archives and the national library.\\n\\nA glance at Piero di Cosimo's portrait of Ferrucci in our National\\nGallery will show that an ordinary Florentine street preceded the\\nerection of the Uffizi. At that time the top storey of the building,\\nas it now exists, was an open terrace affording a pleasant promenade\\nfrom the Palazzo Vecchio down to the river and back to the Loggia\\nde' Lanzi. Beneath this were studios and workrooms where Cosimo's\\narmy of artists and craftsmen (with Bronzino and Cellini as the most\\nfamous) were kept busy; while the public offices were on the ground\\nfloor. Then, as his family increased, Cosimo decided to move, and the\\nincomplete and abandoned Pitti Palace was bought and finished. In 1565,\\nas we have seen, Francis, Cosimo's son, married and was installed in\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio, and it was then that Vasari was called upon to\\nconstruct the Passaggio which unites the Palazzo Vecchio and the Pitti,\\ncrossing the river by the Ponte Vecchio -- Cosimo's idea (borrowed it\\nis said from Homer's description of the passage uniting the palaces of\\nPriam and Hector) being not only that he and his son might have access\\nto each other, but that in the event of danger on the other side of the\\nriver a body of soldiers could be swiftly and secretly mobilized there.\\n\\nCosimo I died in 1574, and Francis I (1574-1587) succeeded him not only\\nin rule but in that patronage of the arts which was one of the finest\\nMedicean traditions; and it was he who first thought of making the\\nUffizi a picture gallery. To do this was simple: it merely meant the\\nloss of part of the terrace by walling and roofing it in. Ferdinand\\nI (1587-1609) added the pretty Tribuna and other rooms, and brought\\nhither a number of the treasures from the Villa Medici at Rome. Cosimo\\nII (1609-1621) did little, but Ferdinand II (1621-1670) completed\\nthe roofing in of the terraces, placed there his own collection of\\ndrawings and a valuable collection of Venetian pictures which he\\nhad bought, together with those that his wife Vittoria della Rovere\\nhad brought him from Urbino, while his brothers, Cardinal Giovanni\\nCarlo de' Medici and Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici (the extremely\\nugly man with the curling chin, at the head of the Uffizi stairs),\\nadded theirs. Giovanni Carlo's pictures, which mostly went to the\\nPitti were varied; but Leopold's were chiefly portraits of artists,\\nwherever possible painted by themselves, a collection which is steadily\\nbeing added to at the present time and is to be seen in several rooms\\nof the Uffizi, and those miniature portraits of men of eminence which\\nwe shall see in the corridor between the Poccetti Gallery and Salon of\\nJustice at the Pitti. Cosimo III (1670-1723) added the Dutch pictures\\nand the famous Venus de' Medici and other Tribuna statuary.\\n\\nThe galleries remained the private property of the Medici family until\\nthe Electress Palatine, Anna Maria Ludovica de' Medici, daughter of\\nCosimo III and great niece of the Cardinal Leopold, bequeathed all\\nthese treasures, to which she had greatly added, together with bronzes\\nnow in the Bargello, Etruscan antiquities now in the Archaeological\\nMuseum, tapestries also there, and books in the Laurentian library,\\nto Florence for ever, on condition that they should never be removed\\nfrom Florence and should exist for the benefit of the public. Her\\ndeath was in 1743, and with her passed away the last descendant of\\nthat Giovanni de' Medici (1360-1429) whom we saw giving commissions\\nto Donatello, building the children's hospital, and helping Florence\\nto the best of his power: so that the first Medici and the last were\\nakin in love of art and in generosity to their beautiful city.\\n\\nThe new Austrian Grand Dukes continued to add to the Uffizi,\\nparticularly Pietro-Leopoldo (1765-1790), who also founded the\\nAccademia. To him was due the assembling, under the Uffizi roof,\\nof all the outlying pictures then belonging to the State, including\\nthose in the gallery of the hospital of S. Maria Nuova, which owned,\\namong others, the famous Hugo van der Goes. It was he also who\\nbrought together from Rome the Niobe statues and constructed a room\\nfor them. Leopold II added the Iscrizioni.\\n\\nIt was as recently as 1842 to 1856 that the statues of the great\\nFlorentines were placed in the portico. These, beginning at the Palazzo\\nVecchio, are, first, against the inner wall, Cosimo Pater (1389-1464)\\nand Lorenzo the Magnificent (1450-1492); then, outside: Orcagna;\\nAndrea Pisano, of the first Baptistery doors; Giotto and Donatello;\\nAlberti, who could do everything and who designed the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nS. Maria Novella; Leonardo and Michelangelo. Next, three poets, Dante\\n(1265-1321), Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374), and Giovanni Boccaccio\\n(1313-1375). Then Niccol\\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469-1527), the statesman,\\nand Francesco Guicciardini (1482-1540), the historian. That completes\\nthe first side.\\n\\nAt the end are Amerigo Vespucci (1451-1516), the explorer, who gave\\nhis name to America, and Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the astronomer;\\nand above is Cosimo I, the first Grand Duke.\\n\\nOn the Uffizi's river fa\\u00e7ade are four figures only -- and hundreds of\\nswallows' nests. The figures are Francesco Ferrucci, who died in 1530,\\nthe general painted by Piero di Cosimo in our National Gallery, who\\nrecaptured Volterra from Pope Clement VII in 1529; Giovanni delle Bande\\nNere (1500-1527), father of Cosimo I, and a great fighting man; Piero\\nCapponi, who died in 1496, and delivered Florence from Charles VIII in\\n1494, by threatening to ring the city bells; and Farinata degli Uberti,\\nan earlier soldier, who died in 1264 and is in the \\\"Divina Commedia\\\"\\nas a hero. It was he who repulsed the Ghibelline suggestion that\\nFlorence should be destroyed and the inhabitants emigrate to Empoli.\\n\\nWorking back towards the Loggia de' Lanzi we find less-known names:\\nPietro Antonio Michele (1679-1737), the botanist; Francesco Redi\\n(1626-1697), a poet and a man of science; Paolo Mascagni (1732-1815),\\nthe anatomist; Andrea Cesalpino (1519-1603), the philosopher;\\nS. Antonio (died 1461), Prior of the Convent of S. Marco and Archbishop\\nof Florence; Francesco Accorso (1182-1229), the jurist; Guido Aretino\\n(eleventh century), musician; and Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1572),\\nthe goldsmith and sculptor. The most notable omissions are Arnolfo\\nand Brunelleschi (but these are, as we have seen, on the fa\\u00e7ade of\\nthe Palazzo de' Canonici, opposite the south side of the cathedral),\\nGhiberti, Fra Angelico, and Savonarola. Personally I should like to\\nhave still others here, among them Giorgio Vasari, in recognition\\nof his enthusiastic and entertaining biographies of the Florentine\\nartists, to say nothing of the circumstance that he designed this\\nbuilding.\\n\\nBefore we enter any Florentine gallery let me say that there is only\\none free day and that the crowded Sabbath. Admittance to nearly all is\\na lira. Moreover, there is no re-admission. The charge strikes English\\nvisitors, accustomed to the open portals of their own museums and\\ngalleries, as an outrage, and it explains also the little interest in\\ntheir treasures which most Florentines display, for being essentially\\na frugal people they have seldom seen them. Visitors who can satisfy\\nthe authorities that they are desirous of studying the works of art\\nwith a serious purpose can obtain free passes; but only after certain\\npreliminaries, which include a seance with a photographer to satisfy\\nthe doorkeeper, by comparing the real and counterfeit physiognomies,\\nthat no illicit transference of the precious privilege has been\\nmade. Italy is, one knows, not a rich country; but the revenue which\\nthe gallery entrance-fees represent cannot reach any great volume,\\nand such as it is it had much better, I should say, be raised by\\nother means. Meanwhile, the foreigner chiefly pays it. What Giovanni\\nde' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici, and -- even more -- what Anna Maria\\nLudovica de' Medici, who bequeathed to the State these possessions,\\nwould think could they see this feverish and implacable pursuit of\\npence, I have not imagination, or scorn, enough to set down.\\n\\nInfirm and languid visitors should get it clearly into their heads (1)\\nthat the tour of the Uffizi means a long walk and (2) that there is\\na lift. You find it in the umbrella room -- at every Florentine gallery\\nand museum is an official whose one object in life is to take away your\\numbrella -- and it costs twopence-halfpenny and is worth far more. But\\nwalking downstairs is imperative, because otherwise one would miss\\nSilenus and Bacchus, and a beautiful urgent Mars, in bronze, together\\nwith other fine sculptured things.\\n\\nOne of the quaintest symbols of conservatism in Florence is the\\nscissors of the officials who supply tickets of entrance. Apparently\\nthe perforated line is unknown in Italy; hence the ticket is divided\\nfrom its counterfoil (which I assume goes to the authorities in\\norder that they may check their horrid takings) by a huge pair\\nof shears. These things are snip-snapping all over Italy, all day\\nlong. Having obtained your ticket you hand it to another official at a\\nturn-stile, and at last you are free of cupidity and red tape and may\\nbreathe easily again and examine the products of the light-hearted,\\ngenerous Renaissance in the right spirit.\\n\\nOne should never forget, in any gallery of Florence, to look out\\nof the windows. There is always a courtyard, a street, or a spire\\nagainst the sky; and at the Uffizi there are the river and bridges\\nand mountains. From the loggia of the Palazzo Vecchio I once saw a\\nwoman with some twenty or thirty city pigeons on the table of her\\nlittle room, feeding them with maize.\\n\\nExcept for glimpses of the river and the Via Guicciardini which it\\ngives, I advise no one to walk through the passage uniting the Pitti\\nand the Uffizi -- unless of course bent on catching some of the ancient\\nthrill when armed men ran swiftly from one palace to the other to quell\\na disturbance or repulse an assault. Particularly does this counsel\\napply to wet days, when all the windows are closed and there is no\\nair. A certain interest attaches to the myriad portraits which line\\nthe walls, chiefly of the Medici and comparatively recent worthies;\\nbut one must have a glutton's passion either for paint or history to\\nwish to examine these. As a matter of fact, only a lightning-speed\\ntourist could possibly think of seeing both the Uffizi and the Pitti\\non the same day, and therefore the need of the passage disappears. It\\nis hard worked only on Sundays.\\n\\nThe drawings in the cases in the first long corridor are worth close\\nstudy -- covering as they do the whole range of great Italian art: from,\\nsay, Uccello to Carlo Dolci. But as they are from time to time changed\\nit is useless to say more of them. There is also on the first landing\\nof the staircase a room in which exhibitions of drawings of the Old\\nMasters are held, and this is worth knowing about, not only because\\nof the riches of the portfolios in the collection, but also because\\nonce you have passed the doors you are inside the only picture gallery\\nin Florence for which no entrance fee is asked. How the authorities\\nhave come to overlook this additional source of revenue, I have no\\nnotion; but they have, and visitors should hasten to make the most\\nof it for fear that a translation of these words of mine may wander\\ninto bad hands.\\n\\nTo name the most wonderful picture in the Uffizi would be a very\\ndifficult task. At the Accademia, if a plebiscite were taken, there is\\nlittle doubt but that Botticelli's \\\"Primavera\\\" would win. At the Pitti\\nI personally would name Giorgione's \\\"Concert\\\" without any hesitation at\\nall; but probably the public vote would go to Raphael's \\\"Madonna della\\nSedia\\\". But the Uffizi? Here we are amid such wealth of masterpieces,\\nand yet when one comes to pass them in review in memory none stands\\nout as those other two I have named. Perhaps Botticelli would win\\nagain, with his \\\"Birth of Venus\\\". Were the Leonardo finished ... but\\nit is only a sketch. Luca Signorelli's wild flowers in No. 74 seem to\\nabide with me as vividly and graciously as anything; but they are but a\\ndetail and it is a very personal predilection. Perhaps the great exotic\\nwork painted far away in Belgium -- the Van der Goes triptych -- is the\\nmost memorable; but to choose an alien canvas is to break the rules of\\nthe game. Is it perhaps the unfinished Leonardo after all? If not, and\\nnot the Botticelli, it is beyond question that lovely adoring Madonna,\\nso gentle and sweet, against the purest and bluest of Tuscan skies,\\nwhich is attributed to Filippino Lippi: No. 1354.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nThe Uffizi II: The First Six Rooms\\n\\nLorenzo Monaco -- Fra Angelico -- Mariotto Albertinelli turns\\ninnkeeper -- The Venetian rooms -- Giorgione's death -- Titian -- Mantegna\\nuniting north and south -- Giovanni Bellini -- Domenico\\nGhirlandaio -- Michelangelo -- Luca Signorelli -- Wild flowers -- Leonardo\\nda Vinci -- Paolo Uccello.\\n\\nThe first and second rooms are Venetian; but I am inclined to think\\nthat it is better to take the second door on the left -- the first Tuscan\\nsalon -- and walking straight across it come at once to the Salon of\\nLorenzo Monaco and the primitives. For the earliest good pictures\\nare here. Here especially one should remember that the pictures\\nwere painted never for a gallery but for churches. Lorenzo Monaco\\n(Lawrence the Monk, 1370-c. 1425), who gives his name to this room,\\nwas a monk of the Camaldolese order in the Monastery of the Angeli,\\nand was a little earlier than Fra Angelico (the Angelic Brother),\\nthe more famous painting monk, whose dates are 1387-1455. Lorenzo\\nwas influenced by Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's godson, friend, pupil, and\\nassistant. His greatest work is this large Uffizi altar-piece -- he\\npainted nothing but altar-pieces -- depicting the Coronation of the\\nVirgin: a great gay scene of splendour, containing pretty angels who\\nmust have been the delight of children in church. The predella -- and\\nhere let me advise the visitor never to overlook the predellas, where\\nthe artist often throws off formality and allows his more natural\\nfeelings to have play, almost as though he painted the picture for\\nothers and the predella for himself -- is peculiarly interesting. Look,\\nat the left, at the death of an old Saint attended by monks and nuns,\\nwhose grief is profound. One other good Lorenzo is here, an \\\"Adoration\\nof the Magi,\\\" No. 39, a little out of drawing but full of life.\\n\\nBut for most people the glory of the room is not Lorenzo the Monk,\\nbut Brother Giovanni of Fiesole, known ever more as Beato, or Fra,\\nAngelico. Of that most adoring and most adorable of painters I say much\\nin the chapter on the Accademia, where he is very fully represented,\\nand it might perhaps be well to turn to those pages (227-230) and read\\nhere, on our first sight of his genius, what is said. Two Angelicos are\\nin this room -- the great triptych, opposite the chief Lorenzo, and the\\n\\\"Crowning of the Virgin,\\\" on an easel. The triptych is as much copied\\nas any picture in the gallery, not, however, for its principal figures,\\nbut for the border of twelve angels round the centre panel. Angelico's\\nbenignancy and sweetness are here, but it is not the equal of the\\n\\\"Coronation,\\\" which is a blaze of pious fervour and glory. The group\\nof saints on the right is very charming; but we are to be more pleased\\nby this radiant hand when we reach the Accademia. Already, however,\\nwe have learned his love of blue. Another altar-piece with a subtle\\nquality of its own is the early Annunciation by Simone Martini of\\nSiena (1285-1344) and Lippo Memmi, his brother (d. 1357), in which\\nthe angel speaks his golden words across the picture through a vase\\nof lilies, and the Virgin receives them shrinkingly. It is all very\\nprimitive, but it has great attraction, and it is interesting to\\nthink that the picture must be getting on for six hundred years of\\nage. This Simone was a pupil of Giotto and the painter of a portrait\\nof Petrarch's Laura, now preserved in the Laurentian library, which\\nearned him two sonnets of eulogy. It is also two Sienese painters\\nwho have made the gayest thing in this room, the predella, No. 1304,\\nby Neroccio di Siena (1447-1500) and Francesco di Giorgio di Siena\\n(1439-1502), containing scenes in the life of S. Benedetto. Neroccio\\ndid the landscape and figures; the other the architecture, and very\\nfine it is. Another delightful predella is that by Benozzo Gozzoli\\n(1420-1498), Fra Angelico's pupil, whom we have seen at the Riccardi\\npalace. Gozzoli's predella is No. 1302. Finally, look at No. 64,\\nwhich shows how prettily certain imitators of Fra Angelico could paint.\\n\\nAfter the Sala di Lorenzo Monaco let us enter the first Tuscan\\nroom. The draughtsmanship of the great Last Judgment fresco by Fra\\nBartolommeo (1475-1517) and Mariotto Albertinelli (1474-1515) is very\\nfine. It is now a ruin, but enough remains to show that it must have\\nbeen impressive. These collaborators, although intimate friends,\\nultimately went different ways, for Fra Bartolommeo came under\\nthe influence of Savonarola, burned his nude drawings, and entered\\nthe Convent of S. Marco; whereas Albertinelli, who was a convivial\\nfollower of Venus, tiring of art and even more of art jargon, took\\nan inn outside the S. Gallo gate and a tavern on the Ponte Vecchio,\\nremarking that he had found a way of life that needed no knowledge\\nof muscles, foreshortening, or perspective, and better still, was\\nwithout critics. Among his pupils was Franciabigio, whose lovely\\nMadonna of the Well we are coming to in the Tribuna.\\n\\nChief among the other pictures are two by the delightful Alessio\\nBaldovinetti, the master of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Nos. 60 and 56;\\nand a large early altar-piece by the brothers Orcagna, painted in\\n1367 for S. Maria Nuova, now the principal hospital of Florence\\nand once the home of many beautiful pictures. This work is rather\\ndingy now, but it is interesting as coming in part from the hand\\nthat designed the tabernacle in Or San Michele and the Loggia de'\\nLanzi. Another less-known painter represented here is Francesco\\nGranacci (1469-1543), the author of Nos. 1541 and 1280, both rich\\nand warm and pleasing. Granacci was a fellow-pupil of Michelangelo\\nboth in Lorenzo de' Medici's garden and in Ghirlandaio's workshop,\\nand the bosom friend of that great man all his life. Like Piero\\ndi Cosimo, Granacci was a great hand at pageantry, and Lorenzo de'\\nMedici kept him busy. He was not dependent upon art for his living,\\nbut painted for love of it, and Vasari makes him a very agreeable man.\\n\\nHere too is Gio. Antonio Sogliani (1492-1544), also a rare painter,\\nwith a finely coloured and finely drawn \\\"Disputa,\\\" No. 63. This painter\\nseems to have had the same devotion to his master, Lorenzo di Credi,\\nthat di Credi had for his master, Verrocchio. Vasari calls Sogliani a\\nworthy religious man who minded his own affairs -- a good epitaph. His\\nwork is rarely met with in Florence, but he has a large fresco at\\nS. Marco. Lorenzo di Credi (1459-1537) himself has two pretty circular\\npaintings here, of which No. 1528 is particularly sweet: \\\"The Virgin\\nand Child with St. John and Angels,\\\" all comfortable and happy in\\na Tuscan meadow; while on an easel is another circular picture, by\\nPacchiarotto (1477-1535). This has good colour and twilight beauty,\\nbut it does not touch one and is not too felicitously composed. Over\\nthe door to the Venetian room is a Cosimo Rosselli with a prettily\\naffectionate Madonna and Child.\\n\\nFrom this miscellaneous Tuscan room we pass to the two rooms which\\ncontain the Venetian pictures, of which I shall say less than might\\nperhaps be expected, not because I do not intensely admire them but\\nbecause I feel that the chief space in a Florentine book should be\\ngiven to Florentine or Tuscan things. As a matter of fact, I find\\nmyself when in the Uffizi continually drawn to revisit these walls. The\\nchief treasures are the Titians, the Giorgiones, the Mantegnas,\\nthe Carpaccio, and the Bellini allegory. These alone would make\\nthe Uffizi a Mecca of connoisseurs. Giorgione is to be found in his\\nrichest perfection at the Pitti, in his one unforgettable work that\\nis preserved there, but here he is wonderful too, with his Cavalier\\nof Malta, black and golden, and the two rich scenes, Nos. 621 and\\n630, nominally from Scripture, but really from romantic Italy. To me\\nthese three pictures are the jewels of the Venetian collection. To\\ndescribe them is impossible: enough to say that some glowing genius\\nproduced them; and whatever the experts admit, personally I prefer\\nto consider that genius Giorgione. Giorgione, who was born in 1477\\nand died young -- at thirty-three -- was, like Titian, the pupil of\\nBellini, but was greatly influenced by Leonardo da Vinci. Later he\\nbecame Titian's master. He was passionately devoted to music and to\\nladies, and it was indeed from a lady that he had his early death,\\nfor he continued to kiss her after she had taken the plague. (No bad\\nway to die, either; for to be in the power of an emotion that sways\\none to such foolishness is surely better than to live the lukewarm\\ncalculating lives of most of us.) Giorgione's claim to distinction\\nis that not only was he a glorious colourist and master of light and\\nshade, but may be said to have invented small genre pictures that\\ncould be earned about and hung in this or that room at pleasure -- such\\npictures as many of the best Dutch painters were to bend their genius\\nto almost exclusively -- his favourite subjects being music parties\\nand picnics. These Moses and Solomon pictures in the Uffizi are of\\ncourse only a pretext for gloriously coloured arrangements of people\\nwith rich scenic backgrounds. No.621 is the finer. The way in which\\nthe baby is being held in the other indicates how little Giorgione\\nthought of verisimilitude. The colour was the thing.\\n\\nAfter the Giorgiones the Titians, chief of which is No.633, \\\"The\\nMadonna and Child with S. John and S. Anthony,\\\" sometimes called the\\n\\\"Madonna of the Roses,\\\" a work which throws a pallor over all Tuscan\\npictures; No.626, the golden Flora, who glows more gloriously every\\nmoment (whom we shall see again, at the Pitti, as the Magdalen);\\nthe Duke and Duchess of Urbino, Nos.605 and 599, the Duchess set\\nat a window with what looks so curiously like a deep blue Surrey\\nlandscape through it and a village spire in the midst; and 618,\\nan unfinished Madonna and Child in which the Master's methods can\\nbe followed. The Child, completed save for the final bath of light,\\nis a miracle of draughtsmanship.\\n\\nThe triptych by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506) is of inexhaustible\\ninterest, for here, as ever, Mantegna is full of thought and\\npurpose. The left panel represents the Ascension, Christ being borne\\nupwards by eleven cherubim in a solid cloud; the right panel -- by far\\nthe best, I think -- shows the Circumcision, where the painter has set\\nhimself various difficulties of architecture and goldsmith's work\\nfor the pleasure of overcoming them, every detail being painted with\\nDutch minuteness and yet leaving the picture big; while the middle\\npanel, which is concave, depicts an Adoration of the Magi that will\\nbear much study. The whole effect is very northern: not much less\\nso than our own new National Gallery Mabuse. Mantegna also has a\\ncharming Madonna and Child, No. 1025, with pleasing pastoral and\\nstone-quarrying activities in the distance.\\n\\nOn the right of the triptych is the so-called Carpaccio (1450-1519),\\na confused but glorious melee of youths and halberds, reds and yellows\\nand browns, very modern and splendid and totally unlike anything else\\nin the whole gallery. Uccello may possibly be recalled, but only for\\nsubject. Finally there is Giovanni Bellini (1426-1516), master of\\nTitian and Giorgione, with his \\\"Sacra Conversazione,\\\" No. 631, which\\nmeans I know not what but has a haunting quality. Later we shall\\nsee a picture by Michelangelo which has been accused of blending\\nChristianity and paganism; but Bellini's sole purpose was to do\\nthis. We have children from a Bacchic vase and the crowned Virgin; two\\nnaked saints and a Venetian lady; and a centaur watching a hermit. The\\nforeground is a mosaic terrace; the background is rocks and water. It\\nis all bizarre and very curious and memorable and quite unique. For the\\nrest, I should mention two charming Guardis; a rich little Canaletto;\\na nice scene of sheep by Jacopo Bassano; the portrait of an unknown\\nyoung man by an unknown painter, No. 1157; and Tintoretto's daring\\n\\\"Abraham and Isaac\\\".\\n\\nThe other Venetian room is almost wholly devoted to portraits, chief\\namong them being a red-headed Tintoretto burning furiously, No. 613,\\nand Titian's sly and sinister Caterina Cornaro in her gorgeous dress,\\nNo. 648; Piombo's \\\"L'Uomo Ammalato\\\"; Tintoretto's Jacopo Sansovino,\\nthe sculptor, the grave old man holding his calipers who made that\\nwonderful Greek Bacchus at the Bargello; Schiavone's ripe, bearded\\n\\\"Ignoto,\\\" No. 649, and, perhaps above all, the Moroni, No. 386,\\nblack against grey. There is also Paolo Veronese's \\\"Holy Family with\\nS. Catherine,\\\" superbly masterly and golden but suggesting the Rialto\\nrather than Nazareth.\\n\\nOne picture gives the next room, the Sala di Michelangelo, its name;\\nbut entering from the Venetian room we come first on the right to a\\nvery well-known Lippo Lippi, copied in every picture shop in Florence:\\nNo. 1307, a Madonna and two Children. Few pictures are so beset by\\ndelighted observers, but apart from the perfection of it as an early\\npainting, leaving nothing to later dexterity, its appeal to me is\\nweak. The Madonna (whose head-dress, as so often in Lippo Lippi,\\nforeshadows Botticelli) and the landscape equally delight; the\\nchildren almost repel, and the decorative furniture in the corner\\nquite repels. The picture is interesting also for its colour, which\\nis unlike anything else in the gallery, the green of the Madonna's\\ndress being especially lovely and distinguished, and vulgarizing\\nthe Ghirlandaio -- No. 1297 -- which hangs next. This picture is far too\\nhot throughout, and would indeed be almost displeasing but for the\\nirradiation of the Virgin's face. The other Ghirlandaio -- No. 1295 -- in\\nthis room is far finer and sweeter; but at the Accademia and the Badia\\nwe are to see him at his best in this class of work. None the less,\\nNo. 1295 is a charming thing, and the little Mother and her happy\\nChild, whose big toe is being so reverently adored by the ancient\\nmage, are very near real simple life. This artist, we shall see,\\nalways paints healthy, honest babies. The seaport in the distance is\\ncharming too.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's place in this room is interesting on account of his\\nrelation to Michelangelo as first instructor; but by the time that the\\ngreat master's \\\"Holy Family,\\\" hanging here, was painted all traces\\nof Ghirlandaio's influence had disappeared, and if any forerunner\\nis noticeable it is Luca Signorelli. But we must first glance at\\nthe pretty little Lorenzo di Credi, No. 1160, the Annunciation,\\nan artificial work full of nice thoughts and touches, with the\\nprettiest little blue Virgin imaginable, a heavenly landscape, and\\na predella in monochrome, in one scene of which Eve rises from the\\nside of the sleeping Adam with extraordinary realism. The announcing\\nGabriel is deferential but positive; Mary is questioning but not\\nwholly surprised. In any collection of Annunciations this picture\\nwould find a prominent place.\\n\\nThe \\\"Holy Family\\\" of Michelangelo -- No. 1139 -- is remarkable for more\\nthan one reason. It is, to begin with, the only finished easel picture\\nthat exists from his brush. It is also his one work in oils, for he\\nafterwards despised that medium as being fit \\\"only for children\\\". The\\nframe is contemporary and was made for it, the whole being commissioned\\nby Angelo Doni, a wealthy connoisseur whose portrait by Raphael we\\nshall see in the Pitti, and who, according to Vasari, did his best to\\nget it cheaper than his bargain, and had in the end to pay dearer. The\\nperiod of the picture is about 1503, while the great David was in\\nprogress, when the painter was twenty-eight. That it is masterly and\\nsuperb there can be no doubt, but, like so much of Michelangelo's\\nwork, it suffers from its author's greatness. There is an austerity\\nof power here that ill consorts with the tender domesticity of the\\nscene, and the Child is a young Hercules. The nude figures in the\\nbackground introduce an alien element and suggest the conflict between\\nChristianity and paganism, the new religion and the old: in short, the\\nTwilight of the Gods. Whether Michelangelo intended this we shall not\\nknow; but there it is. The prevailing impression left by the picture\\nis immense power and virtuosity and no religion. In the beautiful Luca\\nSignorelli -- No.74 -- next it, we find at once a curious similarity and\\ndifference. The Madonna and Child only are in the foreground, a not\\ntoo radiant but very tender couple; in the background are male figures\\nnearly nude: not quite, as Michelangelo made them, and suggesting\\nno discord as in his picture. Luca was born in 1441, and was thus\\nthirty-four years older than Michelangelo. This picture is perhaps that\\none presented by Luca to Lorenzo de' Medici, of which Vasari tells, and\\nif so it was probably on a wall in the Medici palace when Michelangelo\\nas a boy was taught with Lorenzo's sons. Luca's sweetness was alien\\nto Michelangelo, but not his melancholy or his sense of composition;\\nwhile Luca's devotion to the human form as the unit of expression\\nwas in Michelangelo carried out to its highest power. Vasari, who\\nwas a relative of Luca's and a pupil of Michelangelo's, says that\\nhis master had the greatest admiration for Luca's genius.\\n\\nLuca Signorelli was born at Cortona, and was instructed by Piero della\\nFrancesca, whose one Uffizi painting is in a later room. His chief work\\nis at Cortona, at Rome (in the Sixtine Chapel), and at Orvieto. His\\nfame was sufficient in Florence in 1491 for him to be made one of\\nthe judges of the designs for the fa\\u00e7ade of the Duomo. Luca lived\\nto a great age, not dying till 1524, and was much beloved. He was\\nmagnificent in his habits and loved fine clothes, was very kindly\\nand helpful in disposition, and the influence of his naturalness and\\nsincerity upon art was great. One very pretty sad story is told of him,\\nto the effect that when his son, whom he had dearly loved, was killed\\nat Cortona, he caused the body to be stripped, and painted it with the\\nutmost exactitude, that through his own handiwork he might be able\\nto contemplate that treasure of which fate had robbed him. Perhaps\\nthe most beautiful or at any rate the most idiosyncratic thing in the\\npicture before us is its lovely profusion of wayside flowers. These\\ncome out but poorly in the photograph, but in the painting they\\nare exquisite both in form and in detail. Luca painted them as if\\nhe loved them. (There is a hint of the same thoughtful care in the\\nflowers in No. 1133, by Luca, in our National Gallery; but these at\\nFlorence are the best.) No. 74 is in tempera: the next, also by Luca,\\nNo.1291, is in oil, a \\\"Holy Family,\\\" a work at once powerful, rich,\\nand sweet. Here, again, we may trace an influence on Michelangelo,\\nfor the child is shown deprecating a book which his mother is\\ndisplaying, while in the beautiful marble tondo of the \\\"Madonna and\\nChild\\\" by Michelangelo, which we are soon to see in the Bargello,\\na reading lesson is in progress, and the child wearying of it. We\\nfind Luca again in the next large picture -- No.1547 -- a Crucifixion,\\nwith various Saints, done in collaboration with Perugino. The design\\nsuggests Luca rather than his companion, and the woman at the foot of\\nthe cross is surely the type of which he was so fond. The drawing of\\nChrist is masterly and all too sombre for Perugino. Finally, there is\\na Luca predella, No. 1298, representing the Annunciation, the Birth\\nof Christ (in which Joseph is older almost than in any version), and\\nthe Adoration of the Magi, all notable for freedom and richness. Note\\nthe realism and charm and the costume of the two pages of the Magi.\\n\\nAnd now we come to what is perhaps the most lovely picture in the whole\\ngallery, judged purely as colour and sweetness and design -- No.1549 -- a\\n\\\"Madonna Adoring,\\\" with Filippino Lippi's name and an interrogation\\nmark beneath it. Who painted it if not Filippino? That is the question;\\nbut into such problems, which confront one at every turn in Florence,\\nI am neither qualified nor anxious to enter. When doctors disagree any\\none may decide before me. The thought, moreover, that always occurs\\nin the presence of these good debatable pictures, is that any doubt\\nas to their origin merely enriches this already over-rich period,\\nsince some one had to paint them. Simon not pure becomes hardly less\\nremarkable than Simon pure.\\n\\nIf only the Baby were more pleasing, this would be perhaps the most\\ndelightful picture in the world: as it is, its blues alone lift it to\\nthe heavens of delectableness. By an unusual stroke of fortune a crack\\nin the paint where the panels join has made a star in the tender blue\\nsky. The Tuscan landscape is very still and beautiful; the flowers,\\nalthough conventional and not accurate like Luca's, are as pretty\\nas can be; the one unsatisfying element is the Baby, who is a little\\nclumsy and a little in pain, but diffuses radiance none the less. And\\nthe Mother -- the Mother is all perfection and winsomeness. Her face\\nand hands are exquisite, and the Tuscan twilight behind her is so\\nlovely. I have given a reproduction, but colour is essential.\\n\\nThe remaining three pictures in the room are a Bastiano and a\\nPollaiolo, which are rather for the student than for the wanderer,\\nand a charming Ignoto, No. 75, which I like immensely. But Ignoto\\nnearly always paints well.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Leonardo are two pictures which bear the name of\\nthis most fascinating of all the painters of the world. One is the\\nAnnunciation, No. 1288, upon the authenticity of which much has been\\nsaid and written, and the other an unfinished Adoration of the Magi\\nwhich cannot be questioned by anyone. The probabilities are that the\\nAnnunciation is an early work and that the ascription is accurate:\\nat Oxford is a drawing known to be Leonardo's that is almost certainly\\na study for a detail of this work, while among the Leonardo drawings\\nin the His de la Salle collection at the Louvre is something very\\nlike a first sketch of the whole. Certainly one can think of no one\\nelse who could have given the picture its quality, which increases\\nin richness with every visit to the gallery; but the workshop of\\nVerrocchio, where Leonardo worked, together with Lorenzo di Credi and\\nPerugino, with Andrea of the True Eye over all, no doubt put forth\\nwonderful things. The Annunciation is unique in the collection, both\\nin colour and character: nothing in the Uffizi so deepens. There are\\nno cypresses like these in any other picture, no finer drawing than\\nthat of Mary's hands. Luca's flowers are better, in the adjoining\\nroom; one is not too happy about the pedestal of the reading-desk;\\nand there are Virgins whom we can like more; but as a whole it is\\nperhaps the most fascinating picture of all, for it has the Leonardo\\ndarkness as well as light.\\n\\nOf Leonardo I could write for ever, but this book is not the place;\\nfor though he was a Florentine, Florence has very little of his work:\\nthese pictures only, and one of these only for certain, together\\nwith an angel in a work by Verrocchio at the Accademia which we\\nshall see, and possibly a sculptured figure over the north door of\\nthe Baptistery. Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Francis I of\\nFrance, lured him away, to the eternal loss of his own city. It is\\nMilan and Paris that are richest in his work, and after that London,\\nwhich has at South Kensington a sculptured relief by him as well as\\na painting at the National Gallery, a cartoon at Burlington House,\\nand the British Museum drawings.\\n\\nHis other work here -- No. 1252 -- in the grave brown frame, was to have\\nbeen Leonardo's greatest picture in oil, so Vasari says: larger, in\\nfact, than any known picture at that time. Being very indistinct,\\nit is, curiously enough, best as the light begins to fail and the\\nbeautiful wistful faces emerge from the gloom. In their presence one\\nrecalls Leonardo's remark in one of his notebooks that faces are most\\ninteresting beneath a troubled sky. \\\"You should make your portrait,\\\"\\nhe adds, \\\"at the hour of the fall of the evening when it is cloudy\\nor misty, for the light then is perfect.\\\" In the background one can\\ndiscern the prancing horses of the Magi's suite; a staircase with\\nfigures ascending and descending; the rocks and trees of Tuscany;\\nand looking at it one cannot but ponder upon the fatality which seems\\nto have pursued this divine and magical genius, ordaining that almost\\neverything that he put forth should be either destroyed or unfinished:\\nhis work in the Castello at Milan, which might otherwise be an eighth\\nwonder of the world, perished; his \\\"Last Supper\\\" at Milan perishing;\\nhis colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza broken to pieces;\\nhis sculpture lost; his Palazzo Vecchio battle cartoon perished;\\nthis picture only a sketch. Even after long years the evil fate still\\npersists, for in 1911 his \\\"Gioconda\\\" was stolen from the Louvre by\\nmadman or knave.\\n\\nAmong the other pictures in this room is the rather hot \\\"Adoration\\nof the Magi,\\\" by Cosimo Rosselli (1439-1507), over the Leonardo\\n\\\"Annunciation,\\\" a glowing scene of colour and animation: this Cosimo\\nbeing the Cosimo from whom Piero di Cosimo took his name, and an\\nassociate of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and Luca Signorelli\\non the Sixtine Chapel frescoes. On the left wall is Uccello's battle\\npiece, No. 52, very like that in our National Gallery: rich and\\nglorious as decoration, but quite bearing out Vasari's statement that\\nUccello could not draw horses. Uccello was a most laborious student\\nof animal life and so absorbed in the mysteries of perspective that\\nhe preferred them to bed; but he does not seem to have been able to\\nunite them. He was a perpetual butt of Donatello. It is told of him\\nthat having a commission to paint a fresco for the Mercato Vecchio\\nhe kept the progress of the work a secret and allowed no one to\\nsee it. At last, when it was finished, he drew aside the sheet for\\nDonatello, who was buying fruit, to admire. \\\"Ah, Paolo,\\\" said the\\nsculptor reproachfully, \\\"now that you ought to be covering it up,\\nyou uncover it.\\\"\\n\\nThere remain a superb nude study of Venus by Lorenzo di Credi,\\nNo. 3452 -- one of the pictures which escaped Savonarola's bonfire\\nof vanities, and No. 1305, a Virgin and Child with various Saints\\nby Domenico Veneziano (1400-1461), who taught Gentile da Fabriano,\\nthe teacher of Jacopo Bellini. This picture is a complete contrast to\\nthe Uccello: for that is all tapestry, richness, and belligerence,\\nand this is so pale and gentle, with its lovely light green, a rare\\ncolour in this gallery.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nThe Uffizi III: Botticelli\\n\\nA painter apart -- Sandro Filipepi -- Artists' names -- Piero de' Medici -- The\\n\\\"Adoration of the Magi\\\" -- The \\\"Judith\\\" pictures -- Lucrezia Tornabuoni,\\nLorenzo and Giuliano's mother -- The Tournaments -- The \\\"Birth of Venus\\\"\\nand the \\\"Primavera\\\" -- Simonetta -- A new star -- Sacred pictures -- Savonarola\\nand \\\"The Calumny\\\" -- The National Gallery -- Botticelli's old age and\\ndeath.\\n\\nWe come next to the Sala di Botticelli, and such is the position\\nheld by this painter in the affection of visitors to Florence, and\\nsuch the wealth of works from his hand that the Uffizi possesses,\\nthat I feel that a single chapter may well be devoted to his genius,\\nmore particularly as many of his pictures were so closely associated\\nwith Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici. We see Botticelli here\\nat his most varied. The Accademia also is very rich in his work,\\nhaving above all the \\\"Primavera,\\\" and in this chapter I shall glance\\nat the Accademia pictures too, returning to them when we reach that\\ngallery in due course. Among the great Florentine masters Botticelli\\nstands apart by reason not only of the sensitive wistful delicacy\\nof his work, but for the profound interest of his personality. He\\nis not essentially more beautiful than his friend Filippino Lippi\\nor -- occasionally -- than Fra Lippo Lippi his master; but he is always\\ndeeper. One feels that he too felt the emotion that his characters\\ndisplay; he did not merely paint, he thought and suffered. Hence his\\nwork is dramatic. Again Botticelli had far wider sympathies than most\\nof his contemporaries. He was a friend of the Medici, a neo-Platonist,\\na student of theology with the poet Palmieri, an illustrator of Dante,\\nand a devoted follower of Savonarola. Of the part that women played\\nin his life we know nothing: in fact we know less of him intimately\\nthan of almost any of the great painters; but this we may guess, that\\nhe was never a happy man. His work falls naturally into divisions\\ncorresponding to his early devotion to Piero de' Medici and his\\nwife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, in whose house for a while he lived; to\\nhis interest in their sons Lorenzo and Giuliano; and finally to his\\nbelief in Savonarola. Sublime he never is; comforting he never is;\\nbut he is everything else. One can never forget in his presence the\\ntragedy that attends the too earnest seeker after beauty: not \\\"all\\nis vanity\\\" does Botticelli say, but \\\"all is transitory\\\".\\n\\nBotticelli, as we now call him, was the son of Mariano Filipepi and\\nwas born in Florence in 1447. According to one account he was called\\nSandro di Botticelli because he was apprenticed to a goldsmith of\\nthat name; according to another his brother Antonio, a goldsmith,\\nwas known as Botticello (which means a little barrel), and Sandro\\nbeing with him was called Sandro di Botticello. Whatever the cause,\\nthe fact remains that the name of Filipepi is rarely used.\\n\\nAnd here a word as to the capriciousness of the nomenclature of\\nartists. We know some by their Christian names; some by their surnames;\\nsome by their nicknames; some by the names of their towns, and some\\nby the names of their masters. Tommaso Bigordi, a goldsmith, was so\\nclever in designing a pretty garland for women's hair that he was\\ncalled Ghirlandaio, the garland-maker, and his painter son Domenico\\nis therefore known for ever as Uomenico Ghirlandaio. Paolo Doni, a\\npainter of battle scenes, was so fond of birds that he was known as\\nUccello (a bird) and now has no other name; Pietro Vannucci coming\\nfrom Perugia was called Perugino; Agnolo di Francesco di Migliore\\nhappened to be a tailor with a genius of a son, Andrea; that genius is\\ntherefore Andrea of the Tailor -- del Sarto -- for all time. And so forth.\\n\\nTo return to Botticelli. In 1447, when he was born, Fra Angelico\\nwas sixty; and Masaccio had been dead for some years. At the age\\nof twelve the boy was placed with Fra Lippo Lippi, then a man of\\na little more than fifty, to learn painting. That Lippo was his\\nmaster one may see continually, but particularly by comparison of\\nhis headdresses with almost any of Botticelli's. Both were minutely\\ncareful in this detail. But where Lippo was beautifully obvious,\\nSandro was beautifully analytical: he was also, as I have said,\\nmuch more interesting and dramatic.\\n\\nBotticelli's best patron was Piero de' Medici, who took him into\\nhis house, much as his son Lorenzo was to take Michelangelo into\\nhis, and made him one of the family. For Piero, Botticelli always\\nhad affection and respect, and when he painted his \\\"Fortitude\\\" as\\none of the Pollaiuoli's series of the Virtues for the Mercatanzia\\n(of which several are in this gallery), he made the figure symbolize\\nPiero's life and character -- or so it is possible, if one wishes to\\nbelieve. But it should be understood that almost nothing is known\\nabout Botticelli and the origin of his pictures. At Piero's request\\nBotticelli painted the \\\"Adoration of the Magi\\\" (No. 1286) which was\\nto hang in S. Maria Novella as an offering of gratitude for Piero's\\nescape from the conspiracy of Luca Pitti in 1466. Piero had but just\\nsucceeded to Cosimo when Pitti, considering him merely an invalid,\\nstruck his blow. By virtue largely of the young Lorenzo's address\\nthe attack miscarried: hence the presence of Lorenzo in the picture,\\non the extreme left, with a sword. Piero himself in scarlet kneels\\nin the middle; Giuliano, his second son, doomed to an early death by\\nassassination, is kneeling on his right. The picture is not only a\\nsacred painting but (like the Gozzoli fresco at the Riccardi palace)\\nan exaltation of the Medici family. The dead Cosimo is at the Child's\\nfeet; the dead Giovanni, Piero's brother, stands close to the kneeling\\nGiuliano. Among the other persons represented are collateral Medici\\nand certain of their friends.\\n\\nIt is by some accepted that the figure in yellow, on the extreme right,\\nlooking out of this picture, is Botticelli himself. But for a portrait\\nof the painter of more authenticity we must go to the Carmine, where,\\nin the Brancacci chapel, we shall see a fresco by Botticelli's friend\\nFilippino Lippi representing the Crucifixion of S. Peter, in which\\nour painter is depicted on the right, looking on at the scene -- a\\nrather coarse heavy face, with a large mouth and long hair. He wears\\na purple cap and red cloak. Vasari tells us that Botticelli, although\\nso profoundly thoughtful and melancholy in his work, was extravagant,\\npleasure loving, and given to practical jokes. Part at least of this\\nmight be gathered from observation of Filippino Lippi's portrait of\\nhim. According to Vasari it was No. 1286 which brought Botticelli his\\ninvitation to Rome from Sixtus IV to decorate the Sixtine Chapel. But\\nthat was several years later and much was to happen in the interval.\\n\\nThe two little \\\"Judith\\\" pictures (Nos. 1156 and 1158) were painted for\\nPiero de' Medici and had their place in the Medici palace. In 1494,\\nwhen Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici was banished from Florence and the\\npalace looted, they were stolen and lost sight of; but during the reign\\nof Francis I they reappeared and were presented to his wife Bianca\\nCapella and once more placed with the Medici treasures. No. 1156,\\nthe Judith walking springily along, sword in hand, having slain the\\ntyrant, is one of the masterpieces of paint. Everything about it is\\nradiant, superb, and unforgettable.\\n\\nOne other picture which the young painter made for his patron -- or in\\nthis case his patroness, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Piero's wife -- is the\\n\\\"Madonna of the Magnificat,\\\" No. 1267, with its beautiful children and\\nsweet Madonna, its lovely landscape but not too attractive Child. The\\ntwo boys are Lorenzo, on the left, and Giuliano, in yellow. One\\nof their sisters leans over them. Here the boys are perhaps, in\\nBotticelli's way, typified rather than portrayed. Although this\\npicture came so early in his career Botticelli never excelled its\\nrichness, beauty, and depth of feeling, nor its liquid delicacy of\\ntreatment. Lucrezia Tornabuoni, for whom he painted it, was a very\\nremarkable woman, not only a good mother to her children and a good\\nwife to Piero, but a poet and exemplar. She survived Piero by thirteen\\nyears and her son Giuliano by five. Botticelli painted her portrait,\\nwhich is now in Berlin.\\n\\nThese pictures are the principal work of Botticelli's first period,\\nwhich coincides with the five years of Piero's rule and the period\\nof mourning for him.\\n\\nHe next appears in what many of his admirers find his most fascinating\\nmood, as a joyous allegorist, the picture of Venus rising from\\nthe sea in this room, the \\\"Primavera\\\" which we shall see at the\\nAccademia, and the \\\"Mars and Venus\\\" in our National Gallery,\\nbelonging to this epoch. But in order to understand them we must\\nagain go to history. Piero was succeeded in 1469 by his son Lorenzo\\nthe Magnificent, who continued his father's friendship for the young\\npainter, now twenty-two years of age. In 1474 Lorenzo devised for his\\nbrother Giuliano a tournament in the Piazza of S. Croce very like that\\nwhich Piero had given for Lorenzo on the occasion of his betrothal\\nin 1469; and Botticelli was commissioned by Lorenzo to make pictures\\ncommemorating the event. Verrocchio again helped with the costumes;\\nLucrezia Donati again was Queen of the Tournament; but the Queen of\\nBeauty was the sixteen-year-old bride of Marco Vespucci -- the lovely\\nSimonetta Cattaneo, a lady greatly beloved by all and a close friend\\nboth of Giuliano and Lorenzo.\\n\\nThe praises of Lorenzo's tournament had been sung by Luca Pulci:\\nGiuliano's were sung by Poliziano, under the title \\\"La Giostra di\\nGiuliano de' Medici,\\\" and it is this poem which Botticelli may be\\nsaid to have illustrated, for both poet and artist employ the same\\nimagery. Thus Poliziano, or Politian (of whom we shall hear more in the\\nchapter on S. Marco) compares Simonetta to Venus, and in stanzas 100\\nand 101 speaks of her birth, describing her blown to earth over the\\nsea by the breath of the Zephyrs, and welcomed there by the Hours,\\none of whom offers her a robe. This, Botticelli translates into\\nexquisite tempera with a wealth of pretty thoughts. The cornflowers\\nand daisies on the Hour's dress are alone a perennial joy.\\n\\nSimonetta as Venus has some of the wistfulness of the Madonnas;\\nand not without reason does Botticelli give her this expression, for\\nher days were very short. In the \\\"Primavera,\\\" which we are to see at\\nthe Accademia, but which must be described here, we find Simonetta\\nagain but we do not see her first. We see first that slender upright\\ncommanding figure, all flowers and youth and conquest, in her lovely\\nfloral dress, advancing over the grass like thistle-down. Never\\nbefore in painting had anything been done at once so distinguished\\nand joyous and pagan as this. For a kindred emotion one had to go to\\nGreek sculpture, but Botticelli, while his grace and joy are Hellenic,\\nwas intensely modern too: the problems of the Renaissance, the tragedy\\nof Christianity, equally cloud his brow.\\n\\nThe symbolism of the \\\"Primavera\\\" is interesting. Glorious Spring is\\nreturning to earth -- in the presence of Venus -- once more to make all\\nglad, and with her her attendants to dance and sing, and the Zephyrs\\nto bring the soft breezes; and by Spring Botticelli meant the reign\\nof Lorenzo, whose tournament motto was \\\"Le temps revient\\\". Simonetta\\nis again the central figure, and never did Botticelli paint more\\nexquisitely than here. Her bosom is the prettiest in Florence; the\\nlining of her robe over her right arm has such green and blue and\\ngold as never were seen elsewhere; her golden sandals are delicate\\nas gossamer. Over her head a little cupid hovers, directing his arrow\\nat Mercury, on the extreme left, beside the three Graces.\\n\\nIn Mercury, who is touching the trees with his caduceus and\\nbidding them burgeon, some see Giuliano de' Medici, who was not yet\\nbetrothed. But when the picture was painted both Giuliano and Simonetta\\nwere dead: Simonetta first, of consumption, in 1476, and Giuliano, by\\nstabbing in 1478. Lorenzo, who was at Pisa during Simonetta's illness,\\ndetailed his own physician for her care. On hearing of her death he\\nwalked out into the night and noticed for the first time a brilliant\\nstar. \\\"See,\\\" he said, \\\"either the soul of that most gentle lady\\nhath been transferred into that new star or else hath it been joined\\ntogether thereunto.\\\" Of Giuliano's end we have read in Chapter II,\\nand it was Botticelli, whose destinies were so closely bound up with\\nthe Medici, who was commissioned to paint portraits of the murderous\\nPazzi to be displayed outside the Palazzo Vecchio.\\n\\nA third picture in what may be called the tournament period is found by\\nsome in the \\\"Venus and Mars,\\\" No. 915, in our National Gallery. Here\\nGiuliano would be Mars, and Venus either one woman in particular\\nwhom Florence wished him to marry, or all women, typified by one,\\ntrying to lure him from other pre-occupations, such as hunting. To\\nmake her Simonetta is to go too far; for she is not like the Simonetta\\nof the other pictures, and Simonetta was but recently married and a\\nvery model of fair repute. In No. 916 in the National Gallery is a\\n\\\"Venus with Cupids\\\" (which might be by Botticelli and might be by that\\ninteresting painter of whom Mr. Berenson has written so attractively\\nas Amico di Sandro), in which Politian's description of Venus, in\\nhis poem, is again closely followed.\\n\\nAfter the tournament pictures we come in Botticelli's career to the\\nSixtine Chapel frescoes, and on his return to Florence to other\\nfrescoes, including that lovely one at the Villa Lemmi (then the\\nVilla Tornabuoni) which is now on the staircase of the Louvre. These\\nare followed by at least two more Medici pictures -- the portrait of\\nPiero di Lorenzo de' Medici, in this room, No. 1154, the sad-faced\\nyouth with the medal; and the \\\"Pallas and the Centaur\\\" at the Pitti,\\nan historical record of Lorenzo's success as a diplomatist when he\\nwent to Naples in 1480.\\n\\nThe latter part of Botticelli's life was spent under the influence\\nof Savonarola and in despair at the wickedness of the world and its\\ntreatment of that prophet. His pictures became wholly religious, but\\nit was religion without joy. Never capable of disguising the sorrow\\nthat underlies all human happiness -- or, as I think of it in looking\\nat his work, the sense of transience -- Botticelli, as age came upon\\nhim, was more than ever depressed. One has the feeling that he was\\npersuaded that only through devotion and self-negation could peace of\\nmind be gained, and yet for himself could find none. The sceptic was\\ntoo strong in him. Savonarola's eloquence could not make him serene,\\nhowever much he may have come beneath its spell. It but served to\\nincrease his melancholy. Hence these wistful despondent Madonnas, all\\nso conscious of the tragedy before their Child; hence these troubled\\nangels and shadowed saints.\\n\\nSavonarola was hanged and burned in 1498, and Botticelli paid\\na last tribute to his friend in the picture in this room called\\n\\\"The Calumny\\\". Under the pretence of merely illustrating a passage\\nin Lucian, who was one of his favourite authors, Botticelli has\\nrepresented the campaign against the great reformer. The hall\\nrepresents Florence; the judge (with the ears of an ass) the\\nSignoria and the Pope. Into these ears Ignorance and Suspicion\\nare whispering. Calumny, with Envy at her side and tended by Fraud\\nand Deception, holds a torch in one hand and with the other drags\\nher victim, who personifies (but with no attempt at a likeness)\\nSavonarola. Behind are the figures of Remorse, cloaked and miserable,\\nand Truth, naked and unafraid. The statues in the niches ironically\\nrepresent abstract virtues. Everything in the decoration of the palace\\npoints to enlightenment and content; and beyond is the calmest and\\ngreenest of seas.\\n\\nOne more picture was Botticelli to paint, and this also was to\\nthe glory of Savonarola. By good fortune it belongs to the English\\npeople and is No. 1034 in the National Gallery. It has upon it a\\nGreek inscription in the painter's own hand which runs in English\\nas follows: \\\"This picture I, Alessandro, painted at the end of the\\nyear 1500, in the troubles of Italy, in the half-time after the time\\nduring the fulfilment of the eleventh of St. John, in the second\\nwoe of the Apocalypse, in the loosing of the devil for three years\\nand a half. Afterwards he shall be confined, and we shall see him\\ntrodden down, as in this picture.\\\" The loosing of the devil was the\\nthree years and a half after Savonarola's execution on May 23rd,\\n1498, when Florence was mad with reaction from the severity of his\\ndiscipline. S. John says, \\\"I will give power unto my two witnesses,\\nand they shall prophesy\\\"; the painter makes three, Savonarola having\\nhad two comrades with him. The picture was intended to give heart to\\nthe followers of Savonarola and bring promise of ultimate triumph.\\n\\nAfter the death of Savonarola, Botticelli became both poor and\\ninfirm. He had saved no money and all his friends were dead -- Piero de'\\nMedici, Lorenzo, Giuliano, Lucrezia, Simonetta, Filippino Lippi, and\\nSavonarola. He hobbled about on crutches for a while, a pensioner of\\nthe Medici family, and dying at the age of seventy-eight was buried\\nin Ognissanti, but without a tombstone for fear of desecration by\\nthe enemies of Savonarola's adherents.\\n\\nSuch is the outline of Botticelli's life. We will now look at such\\nof the pictures in this room as have not been mentioned.\\n\\nEntering from the Sala di Leonardo, the first picture on the right is\\nthe \\\"Birth of Venus\\\". Then the very typical circular picture -- a shape\\nwhich has come to be intimately associated with this painter -- No. 1289,\\n\\\"The Madonna of the Pomegranate,\\\" one of his most beautiful works,\\nand possibly yet another designed for Lucrezia Tornabuoni, for the\\ncurl on the forehead of the boy to the left of the Madonna -- who is\\nmore than usually troubled -- is very like that for which Giuliano de'\\nMedici was famous. This is a very lovely work, although its colour\\nis a little depressed. Next is the most remarkable of the Piero de'\\nMedici pictures, which I have already touched upon -- No. 1286, \\\"The\\nAdoration of the Magi,\\\" as different from the Venus as could be:\\nthe Venus so cool and transparent, and this so hot and rich, with\\nits haughty Florentines and sumptuous cloaks. Above it is No. 23,\\na less subtle group -- the Madonna, the Child and angels -- difficult to\\nsee. And then comes the beautiful \\\"Magnificat,\\\" which we know to have\\nbeen painted for Lucrezia Tornabuoni and which shall here introduce a\\npassage from Pater: \\\"For with Botticelli she too, although she holds in\\nher hands the 'Desire of all nations,' is one of those who are neither\\nfor Jehovah nor for His enemies; and her choice is on her face. The\\nwhite light on it is cast up hard and cheerless from below, as when\\nsnow lies upon the ground, and the children look up with surprise\\nat the strange whiteness of the ceiling. Her trouble is in the very\\ncaress of the mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her,\\nand who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never\\nbeen able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an\\nobject almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he\\nguides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her exaltation,\\nthe 'Ave,' and the 'Magnificat,' and the 'Gaude Maria,' and the young\\nangels, glad to rouse her for a moment from her devotion, are eager\\nto hold the ink-horn and to support the book. But the pen almost\\ndrops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her,\\nand her true children are those others among whom, in her rude home,\\nthe intolerable honour came to her, with that look of wistful inquiry\\non their irregular faces which you see in startled animals -- gipsy\\nchildren, such as those who, in Apennine villages, still hold out\\ntheir long brown arms to beg of you, with their thick black hair\\nnicely combed, and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats.\\\"\\n\\nThe picture's frame is that which was made for it four hundred and\\nfifty years ago: by whom, I cannot say, but it was the custom at that\\ntime for the painter himself to be responsible also for the frame.\\n\\nThe glory of the end wall is the \\\"Annunciation,\\\" reproduced in this\\nbook. The picture is a work that may perhaps not wholly please at\\nfirst, the cause largely of the vermilion on the floor, but in the\\nend conquers. The hands are among the most beautiful in existence,\\nand the landscape, with its one tree and its fairy architecture, is a\\ncontinual delight. Among \\\"Annunciations,\\\" as among pictures, it stands\\nvery high. It has more of sophistication than most: the Virgin not\\nonly recognizes the honour, but the doom, which the painter himself\\nforeshadows in the predella, where Christ is seen rising from the\\ngrave. None of Fra Angelico's simple radiance here, and none of Fra\\nLippo Lippi's glorified matter-of-fact. Here is tragedy. The painting\\nof the Virgin's head-dress is again marvellous.\\n\\nNext the \\\"Annunciation\\\" on the left is, to my eyes, one of Botticelli's\\nmost attractive works: No. 1303, just the Madonna and Child again,\\nin a niche, with roses climbing behind them: the Madonna one of his\\nyoungest, and more placid and simple than most, with more than a hint\\nof the Verrocchio type in her face. To the \\\"School of Botticelli\\\" this\\nis sometimes attributed: it may be rightly. Its pendant is another\\n\\\"Madonna and Child,\\\" No. 76, more like Lippo Lippi and very beautiful\\nin its darker graver way.\\n\\nThe other wall has the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" the \\\"Calumny,\\\" and the two little\\n\\\"Judith and Holofernes\\\" pictures. Upon the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" to which I\\nhave already alluded, it is well to look at Ruskin, who, however,\\nwas not aware that the artist intended any symbolic reference to\\nthe character and career of Piero de' Medici. The criticism is in\\n\\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" and it is followed by some fine pages on the\\n\\\"Judith\\\". The \\\"Justice,\\\" \\\"Prudence,\\\" and \\\"Charity\\\" of the Pollaiuolo\\nbrothers, belonging to the same series as the \\\"Fortitude,\\\" are also\\nhere; but after the \\\"Fortitude\\\" one does not look at them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nthe Uffizi IV: Remaining Rooms\\n\\nS. Zenobius -- Piero della Francesca -- Federigo da Montefeltro -- Melozzo\\nda Forli -- The Tribuna -- Raphael -- Re-arrangement -- The gems -- The\\nself-painted portraits -- A northern room -- Hugo van der Goes -- \\nTommaso Portinari -- The sympathetic Memling -- Rubens riotous -- Vittoria\\ndella Rovere -- Baroccio -- Honthorst -- Giovanni the indiscreet -- The\\nMedusa -- Medici miniatures -- Hercules Seghers -- The Sala di Niobe -- \\nBeautiful antiques.\\n\\nPassing from the Sala di Botticelli through the Sala di Lorenzo\\nMonaco and the first Tuscan rooms to the corridor, we come to\\nthe second Tuscan room, which is dominated by Andrea del Sarto\\n(1486-1531), whose \\\"Madonna and Child,\\\" with \\\"S. Francis and S. John\\nthe Evangelist\\\" -- No. 112 -- is certainly the favourite picture here,\\nas it is, in reproduction, in so many homes; but, apart from the\\nChild, I like far better the \\\"S. Giacomo\\\" -- No. 1254 -- so sympathetic\\nand rich in colour, which is reproduced in this volume. Another\\ngood Andrea is No. 93 -- a soft and misty apparition of Christ to\\nthe Magdalen. The Sodoma (1477-1549) on the easel -- \\\"S. Sebastian,\\\"\\nNo. 1279 -- is very beautiful in its Leonardesque hues and romantic\\nlandscape, and the two Ridolfo Ghirlandaios (1483-1561) near it are\\ninteresting as representing, with much hard force, scenes in the story\\nof S. Zenobius, of Florence, of whom we read in chapter II. In one he\\nrestores life to the dead child in the midst of a Florentine crowd;\\nin the other his bier, passing the Baptistery, reanimates the dead\\ntree. Giotto's tower and the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio are to be\\nseen on the left. A very different picture is the Cosimo Rosselli,\\nNo. 1280 his, a comely \\\"Madonna and Saints,\\\" with a motherly thought\\nin the treatment of the bodice.\\n\\nAmong the other pictures is a naked sprawling scene of bodies and\\nlimbs by Cosimo I's favourite painter, Bronzino (1502-1572), called\\n\\\"The Saviour in Hell,\\\" and two nice Medici children from the same\\nbrush, which was kept busy both on the living and ancestral lineaments\\nof that family; two Filippino Lippis, both fine if with a little\\ntoo much colour for this painter: one -- No. 1257 -- approaching the\\nhotness of a Ghirlandaio carpet piece, but a great feat of crowded\\nactivity; the other, No. 1268, having a beautiful blue Madonna and\\na pretty little cherub with a red book. Piero di Cosimo is here,\\nreligious and not mythological; and here are a very straightforward\\nand satisfying Mariotto Albertinelli -- the \\\"Virgin and S. Elizabeth,\\\"\\nvery like a Fra Bartolommeo; a very rich and beautiful \\\"Deposition\\\"\\nby Botticini, one of Verrocchio's pupils, with a gay little predella\\nunderneath it, and a pretty \\\"Holy Family\\\" by Franciabigio. But Andrea\\nremains the king of the walls.\\n\\nFrom this Sala a little room is gained which I advise all\\ntired visitors to the Uffizi to make their harbour of refuge and\\nrecuperation; for it has only three or four pictures in it and three\\nor four pieces of sculpture and some pleasant maps and tapestry\\non the walls, and from its windows you look across the brown-red\\ntiles to S. Miniato. The pictures, although so few, are peculiarly\\nattractive, being the work of two very rare hands, Piero della\\nFrancesca (? 1398-1492) and Melozzo da Forli (1438-1494). Melozzo\\nhas here a very charming Annunciation in two panels, the fascination\\nof which I cannot describe. That they are fascinating there is,\\nhowever, no doubt. We have symbolical figures by him in our National\\nGallery -- again hanging next to Piero della Francesca -- but they are not\\nthe equal of these in charm, although very charming. These grow more\\nattractive with every visit: the eager advancing angel with his lily,\\nand the timid little Virgin in her green dress, with folded hands.\\n\\nThe two Pieros are, of course, superb. Piero never painted anything\\nthat was not distinguished and liquid, and here he gives us of\\nhis best: portraits of Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and\\nBattista, his second Duchess, with classical scenes behind them. Piero\\ndella Francesca has ever been one of my favourite painters, and here he\\nis wholly a joy. Of his works Florence has but few, since he was not\\na Florentine, nor did he work here, being engaged chiefly at Urbino,\\nFerrara, Arezzo, and Rome. His life ended sadly, for he became totally\\nblind. In addition to his painting he was a mathematician of much\\nrepute. The Duke of Urbino here depicted is Federigo da Montefeltro,\\nwho ruled from 1444 to 1482, and in 1459 married as his second wife\\na daughter of Alessandro Sforza, of Pesaro, the wedding being the\\noccasion of Piero's pictures. The duke stands out among the many\\nItalian lords of that time as a humane and beneficent ruler and\\ncollector, and eager to administer well. He was a born fighter, and it\\nwas owing to the loss of his right eye and the fracture of his noble\\nold nose that he is seen here in such a determined profile against\\nthe lovely light over the Umbrian hills. The symbolical chariots in\\nthe landscape at the back represent respectively the Triumph of Fame\\n(the Duke's) and the Triumph of Chastity (that of the Duchess). The\\nDuke's companions are Victory, Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and\\nTemperance; the little Duchess's are Love, Hope, Faith, Charity,\\nand Innocence; and if these are not exquisite pictures I never saw any.\\n\\nThe statues in the room should not be missed, particularly the little\\nGenius of Love, the Bacchus and Ampelos, and the spoilt little comely\\nboy supposed to represent -- and quite conceivably -- the infant Nero.\\n\\nCrossing the large Tuscan room again, we come to a little narrow room\\nfilled with what are now called cabinet pictures: far too many to\\nstudy properly, but comprising a benignant old man's head, No. 1167,\\nwhich is sometimes called a Filippino Lippi and sometimes a Masaccio,\\na fragment of a fresco; a boy from the serene perfect hand of Perugino,\\nNo. 1217; two little panels by Fra Bartolommeo -- No. 1161 -- painted for a\\ntabernacle to hold a Donatello relief and representing the Circumcision\\nand Nativity, in colours, and at the back a pretty Annunciation in\\nmonochrome; No. 1235, on the opposite wall, a very sweet Mother and\\nChild by the same artist; a Perseus liberating Andromeda, by Piero\\ndi Cosimo, No. 1312; two or three Lorenzo di Credis; two or three\\nAlloris; a portrait of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, by Antonio Pollaiuolo;\\nand three charming little scenes from the lives of S. John the Baptist\\nand the Virgin, by Fra Angelico, which belong properly to the predella\\nof an altar-piece that we saw in the first room we entered -- No. 1290,\\n\\\"The Coronation of the Virgin\\\". No. 1162 has the gayest green dress\\nin it imaginable.\\n\\nAnd here we enter the Tribuna, which is to the Uffizi what the Salon\\nCarr\\u00e9 is to the Louvre: the special treasure-room of the gallery,\\nholding its most valuable pictures. But to-day there are as good works\\noutside it as in; for the Michelangelo has been moved to another\\nroom, and Botticelli (to name no other) is not represented here at\\nall. Probably the statue famous as the Venus de' Medici would be\\nconsidered the Tribuna's chief possession; but not by me. Nor should\\nI vote either for Titian's Venus. In sculpture I should choose rather\\nthe \\\"Knife-sharpener,\\\" and among the pictures Raphael's \\\"Madonna del\\nCardellino,\\\" No. 1129. But this is not to suggest that everything\\nis not a masterpiece, for it is. Beginning at the door leading from\\nthe room of the little pictures, we find, on our left, Raphael's\\n\\\"Ignota,\\\" No. 1120, so rich and unfeeling, and then Francia's portrait\\nof Evangelista Scappi, so rich and real and a picture that one never\\nforgets. Raphael's Julius II comes next, not so powerful as the version\\nin the Pitti, and above that Titian's famous Venus. In Perugino's\\nportrait of Francesco delle Opere, No. 287, we find an evening sky\\nand landscape still more lovely than Francia's. This Francesco was\\nbrother of Giovanni delle Corniole, a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of Lorenzo de' Medici,\\nfamous as a carver of intaglios, whose portrait of Savonarola in\\nthis medium, now preserved in the Uffizi, in the Gem Room, was said\\nby Michelangelo to carry art to its farthest possible point.\\n\\nA placid and typical Perugino -- the Virgin and two saints -- comes next,\\nand then a northern air sweeps in with Van Dyck's Giovanni di Montfort,\\nnow darkening into gloom but very fine and commanding. Titian's second\\nVenus is above, for which his daughter Lavinia acted as model (the\\nVenus of the other version being possibly the Marchesa della Rovere),\\nand under it is the only Luini in the Uffizi, unmistakably from the\\nsweet hand and full of Leonardesque influence. Beneath this is a rich\\nand decorative work of the Veronese school, a portrait of Elisabetta\\nGonzaga, with another evening sky. Then we go north again, to D\\u00fcrer's\\nAdoration of the Magi, a picture full of pleasant detail -- a little\\nmountain town here, a knight in difficulties with his horse there,\\ntwo butterflies close to the Madonna -- and interesting also for the\\ntreatment of the main theme in D\\u00fcrer's masterly careful way; and then\\nto Spain to Spagnoletto's \\\"S. Jerome\\\" in sombre chiaroscuro; then north\\nagain to a painfully real Christ crowned with thorns, by Lucas van\\nLeyden, and the mousy, Reynoldsy, first wife of Peter Paul Rubens,\\nwhile a Van Dyck portrait under a superb Domenichino and an \\\"Adam\\nand Eve\\\" by Lucas Cranach complete the northern group. And so we come\\nto the two Correggios -- so accomplished and rich and untouching -- all\\ndelightful virtuosity without feeling. The favourite is, of course,\\nNo. 1134, for its adorable Baby, whose natural charm atones for its\\ntheatrical Mother.\\n\\nOn the other side of the door is No. 1129, the perfect \\\"Madonna\\ndel Cardellino\\\" of Raphael, so called from the goldfinch that the\\nlittle boys are caressing. This, one is forced to consider one of the\\nperfect pictures of the world, even though others may communicate more\\npleasure. The landscape is so exquisite and the mild sweetness of the\\nwhole work so complete; and yet, although the technical mastery is\\nalmost thrilling, the \\\"Madonna del Pozzo\\\" by Andrea del Sarto's friend\\nFranciabigio, close by -- No. 1125 -- arouses infinitely livelier feelings\\nin the observer, so much movement and happiness has it. Raphael is\\nperfect but cold; Franciabigio is less perfect (although exceedingly\\naccomplished) but warm with life. The charm of this picture is as\\nnotable as the skill of Raphael's: it is wholly joyous, and the little\\nMadonna really once lived. Both are reproduced in this volume.\\n\\nRaphael's neighbouring youthful \\\"John the Baptist\\\" is almost a\\nGiorgione for richness, but is as truly Raphael as the Sebastian\\ndel Piombo, once (like the Franciabigio also) called a Raphael, is\\nnot. How it came to be considered Raphael, except that there may be\\na faint likeness to the Fornarina, is a mystery.\\n\\nThe rooms next the Tribuna have for some time been under\\nreconstruction, and of these I say little, nor of what pictures are\\nto be placed there. But with the Tribuna, in any case, the collection\\nsuddenly declines, begins to crumble. The first of these rooms, in the\\nspring of this year, 1912, was opened with a number of small Italian\\npaintings; but they are probably only temporarily there. Chief among\\nthem was a Parmigianino, a Boltraffio, a pretty little Guido Reni,\\na Cosimo Tura, a Lorenzo Costa, but nothing really important.\\n\\nIn the tiny Gem Room at the end of the corridor are wonders of\\nthe lapidary's art -- and here is the famous intaglio portrait of\\nSavonarola -- but they want better treatment. The vases and other\\nornaments should have the light all round them, as in the Galerie\\nd'Apollon at the Louvre. These are packed together in wall cases and\\nare hard to see.\\n\\nPassing through the end corridor, where the beautiful Matrona reclines\\nso placidly on her couch against the light, and where we have such\\npleasant views of the Ponte Vecchio, the Trinita bridge, the Arno,\\nand the Apennines, so fresh and real and soothing after so much paint,\\nwe come to the rooms containing the famous collection of self-painted\\nportraits, which, moved hither from Rome, has been accumulating\\nin the Uffizi for many years and is still growing, to be invited\\nto contribute to it being one of the highest honours a painter can\\nreceive. The portraits occupy eight rooms and a passage. Though the\\ncollection is historically and biographically valuable, it contains for\\nevery interesting portrait three or four dull ones, and thus becomes\\nsomething of a weariness. Among the best are Lucas Cranach, Anton More,\\nVan Dyck, Rembrandt (three), Rubens, Seybold, Jordaens, Reynolds,\\nand Romney, all of which remind us of Michelangelo's dry comment,\\n\\\"Every painter draws himself well\\\". Among the most interesting to us,\\nwandering in Florence, are the two Andreas, one youthful and the other\\ngrown fatter than one likes and very different from the melancholy\\nromantic figure in the Pitti; Verrocchio, by Lorenzo di Credi; Carlo\\nDolci, surprising by its good sense and humour; Raphael, angelic,\\nwistful, and weak; Tintoretto, old and powerful; and Jacopo Bassano,\\nold and simple. Among the moderns, Corot's portrait of himself is\\none of the most memorable, but Fantin Latour, Flandrin, Leon Bonnat,\\nand Lenbach are all strong and modest; which one cannot say of our\\nown Leighton. Among the later English heads Orchardson's is notable,\\nbut Mr. Sargent's is disappointing.\\n\\nWe now come to one of the most remarkable rooms in the gallery, where\\nevery picture is a gem; but since all are northern pictures, imported,\\nI give no reproductions. This is the Sala di Van der Goes, so called\\nfrom the great work here, the triptych, painted in 1474 to 1477 by\\nHugo van der Goes, who died in 1482, and was born at Ghent or Leyden\\nabout 1405. This painter, of whose genius there can be no question,\\nis supposed to have been a pupil of the Van Eycks. Not much is known\\nof him save that he painted at Bruges and Ghent and in 1476 entered\\na convent at Brussels where he was allowed to dine with distinguished\\nstrangers who came to see him and where he drank so much wine that his\\nnatural excitability turned to insanity. He seems, however, to have\\nrecovered, and if ever a picture showed few signs of a deranged or\\ninflamed mind it is this, which was painted for the agent of the Medici\\nbank at Bruges, Tommaso Portinari, who presented it to the Hospital of\\nS. Maria Nuova in his native city of Florence, which had been founded\\nby his ancestor Folco, the father of Dante's Beatrice. The left panel\\nshows Tommaso praying with his two sons Antonio and Pigallo, the right\\nhis wife Maria Portinari and their adorably quaint little daughter\\nwith her charming head-dress and costume. The flowers in the centre\\npanel are among the most beautiful things in any Florentine picture:\\nnot wild and wayward like Luca Signorelli's, but most exquisitely\\ndone: irises, red lilies, columbines and dark red clove pinks -- all\\nunexpected and all very unlikely to be in such a wintry landscape at\\nall. On the ground are violets. The whole work is grave, austere,\\ncool, and as different as can be from the Tuscan spirit; yet it is\\nsaid to have had a deep influence on the painters of the time and\\nmust have drawn throngs to the Hospital to see it.\\n\\nThe other Flemish and German pictures in the room are all remarkable\\nand all warmer in tone. No. 906, an unknown work, is perhaps the\\nfinest: a Crucifixion, which might have borrowed its richness from\\nthe Carpaccio, we saw in the Venetian room. There is a fine Adoration\\nof the Magi, by Gerard David (1460-1523); an unknown portrait of\\nPierantonio Baroncelli and his wife, with a lovely landscape; a jewel\\nof paint by Hans Memling (1425-1492) -- No. 703 -- the Madonna Enthroned;\\na masterpiece of drawing by D\\u00fcrer, \\\"Calvary\\\"; an austere and poignant\\nTransportation of Christ to the Sepulchre, by Roger van der Weyden\\n(1400-1464); and several very beautiful portraits by Memling, notably\\nNos. 769 and 780 with their lovely evening light. Memling, indeed,\\nI never liked better than here. Other fine pictures are a Spanish\\nprince by Lucas van Leyden; an old Dutch scholar by an artist unknown,\\nNo. 784; and a young husband and wife by Joost van Cleef the Elder,\\nand a Breughel the Elder, like an old Crome -- a beauty -- No. 928. The\\nroom is interesting both for itself and also as showing how the\\nFlemish brushes were working at the time that so many of the great\\nItalians were engaged on similar themes.\\n\\nAfter the cool, self-contained, scientific work of these northerners\\nit is a change to enter the Sala di Rubens and find that luxuriant\\ngiant -- their compatriot, but how different! -- once more. In the Uffizi,\\nRubens seems more foreign, far, than any one, so fleshly pagan is\\nhe. In Antwerp Cathedral his \\\"Descent from the Cross,\\\" although\\nits bravura is, as always with him, more noticeable than its piety,\\nmight be called a religious picture, but I doubt if even that would\\nseem so here. At any rate his Uffizi works are all secular, while\\nhis \\\"Holy Family\\\" in the Pitti is merely domestic and robust. His\\nFlorentine masterpieces are the two Henri IV pictures in this room,\\n\\\"Henri IV at Ivry,\\\" magnificent if not war, and \\\"Henri's entry into\\nParis after Ivry,\\\" with its confusing muddle of naked warriors and\\nspears. Only Rubens could have painted these spirited, impossible,\\nglorious things, which for all their greatness send one's thoughts\\nback longingly to the portrait of his wife, in the Tribuna, while\\nNo. 216 -- the Bacchanale -- is so coarse as almost to send one's feet\\nthere too.\\n\\nLooking round the room, after Rubens has been dismissed, it is too\\nevident that the best of the Uffizi collection is behind us. There\\nare interesting portraits here, but biographically rather than\\nartistically. Here are one or two fine Sustermans' (1597-1681),\\nthat imported painter whom we shall find in such rare form at the\\nPitti. Here, for example, is Ferdinand II, who did so much for the\\nUffizi and so little for Galileo; and his cousin and wife Vittoria\\ndella Rovere, daughter of Claudia de' Medici (whose portrait, No. 763,\\nis on the easel), and Federigo della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. This\\nsilly, plump lady had been married at the age of fourteen, and she\\nbrought her husband a little money and many pictures from Urbino,\\nnotably those delightful portraits of an earlier Duke and Duchess of\\nUrbino by Piero della Francesca, and also the two Titian \\\"Venuses\\\"\\nin the Tribuna. Ferdinand II and his Grand Duchess were on bad terms\\nfor most of their lives, and she behaved foolishly, and brought up\\nher son Cosimo III foolishly, and altogether was a misfortune to\\nFlorence. Sustermans the painter she held in the highest esteem, and\\nin return he painted her not only as herself but in various unlikely\\ncharacters, among them a Vestal Virgin and even the Madonna.\\n\\nHere also is No. 196, Van Dyck's portrait of Margherita of Lorraine,\\nwhose daughter became Cosimo III's wife -- a mischievous, weak face\\nbut magnificently painted; and No. 1536, a vividly-painted elderly\\nwidow by Jordaens (1593-1678); and on each side of the outrageous\\nRubens a distinguished Dutch gentleman and lady by the placid,\\nrefined Mierevelt.\\n\\nThe two priceless rooms devoted to Iscrizioni come next, but we\\nwill finish the pictures first and therefore pass on to the Sala di\\nBaroccio. Federigo Baroccio (1528-1612) is one of the later painters\\nfor whom I, at any rate, cannot feel any enthusiasm. His position in\\nthe Uffizi is due rather to the circumstance that he was a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of\\nthe Cardinal della Rovere at Rome, whose collection came here, than to\\nhis genius. This room again is of interest rather historically than\\nartistically. Here, for example, are some good Medici portraits by\\nBronzino, among them the famous Eleanora of Toledo, wife of Cosimo I,\\nin a rich brocade (in which she was buried), with the little staring\\nFerdinand I beside her. Eleanora, as we saw in chapter V. was the first\\nmistress of the Pitti palace, and the lady who so disliked Cellini and\\ngot him into such trouble through his lying tongue. Bronzino's little\\nMaria de' Medici -- No. 1164 -- is more pleasing, for the other picture has\\na sinister air. This child, the first-born of Cosimo I and Eleanora,\\ndied when only sixteen. Baroccio has a fine portrait -- Francesco Maria\\nII, last Duke of Urbino, and the grandfather of the Vittoria della\\nRovere whom we saw in the Sala di Rubens. Here also is a portrait\\nof Lorenzo the Magnificent by Vasari, but it is of small value\\nsince Vasari was not born till after Lorenzo's death. The Galileo\\nby Sustermans -- No. 163 -- on the contrary would be from life; and\\nafter the Tribuna portrait of Rubens' first wife it is interesting\\nto find here his pleasant portrait of Helen Fourment, his second. To\\nmy eyes two of the most attractive pictures in the room are the Young\\nSculptor -- No. 1266 -- by Bronzino, and the version of Leonardo's S. Anne\\nat the Louvre by Andrea Salaino of Milan (1483?-1520?). I like also\\nthe hints of tenderness of Bernardino Luini which break through the\\nhardness of the Aurelio Luini picture -- No. 204. For the rest there are\\nsome sickly Guido Renis and Carlo Dolcis and a sentimental Guercino.\\n\\nBut the most popular works -- on Sundays -- are the two Gerard Honthorsts,\\nand not without reason, for they are dramatic and bold and vivid,\\nand there is a Baby in each that goes straight to the maternal\\nheart. No. 157 is perhaps the more satisfying, but I have more reason\\nto remember the larger one -- the Adoration of the Shepherds -- for I\\nwatched a copyist produce a most remarkable replica of it in something\\nunder a week, on the same scale. He was a short, swarthy man with\\na neck like a bull's, and he carried the task off with astonishing\\nbrio, never drawing a line, finishing each part as he came to it, and\\ntalking to a friend or an official the whole time. Somehow one felt him\\nto be precisely the type of copyist that Gherardo della Notte ought\\nto have. This painter was born at Utrecht in 1590 but went early to\\nItaly, and settling in Rome devoted himself to mastering the methods\\nof Amerighi, better known as Caravaggio (1569-1609), who specialized\\nin strong contrasts of light and shade. After learning all he could\\nin Rome, Honthorst returned to Holland and made much money and fame,\\nfor his hand was swift and sure. Charles I engaged him to decorate\\nWhitehall. He died in 1656. These two Honthorsts are, as I say, the\\nmost popular of the pictures on Sunday, when the Uffizi is free; but\\ntheir supremacy is challenged by the five inlaid tables, one of which,\\nchiefly in lapis lazuli, must be the bluest thing on earth.\\n\\nPassing for the present the Sala di Niobe, we come to the Sala di\\nGiovanni di San Giovanni, which is given to a second-rate painter who\\nwas born in 1599 and died in 1636. His best work is a fresco at the\\nBadia of Fiesole. Here he has some theatrical things, including one\\npicture which sends English ladies out blushing. Here also are some\\nLelys, including \\\"Nelly Gwynn\\\". Next are two rooms, one leading from\\nthe other, given to German and Flemish pictures and to miniatures,\\nboth of which are interesting. In the first are more D\\u00fcrers, and\\nthat alone would make it a desirable resort. Here is a \\\"Virgin and\\nChild\\\" -- No. 851 -- very naive and homely, and the beautiful portrait of\\nhis father -- No. 766 -- -a symphony of brown and green. Less attractive\\nworks from the same hand are the \\\"Apostle Philip\\\" -- No. 777 -- and\\n\\\"S. Giacomo Maggiore,\\\" an old man very coarsely painted by comparison\\nwith the artist's father. Here also is a very beautiful portrait\\nof Richard Southwell, by Holbein, with the peacock-green background\\nthat we know so well and always rejoice to see; a typical candle-light\\nSchalcken, No. 800; several golden Poelenburghs; an anonymous portrait\\nof Virgilius von Hytta of Zuicham, No. 784; a clever smiling lady by\\nSustermans, No. 709; the Signora Puliciani and her husband, No. 699;\\na rather crudely coloured Rubens -- \\\"Venus and Adonis\\\" -- No. 812; the\\nsame artist's \\\"Three Graces,\\\" in monochrome, very naked; and some\\nquaint portraits by Lucas Cranach.\\n\\nBut no doubt to many persons the most enchaining picture here is\\nthe Medusa's head, which used to be called a Leonardo and quite\\nsatisfied Ruskin of its genuineness, but is now attributed to the\\nFlemish school. The head, at any rate, would seem to be very similar\\nto that of which Vasari speaks, painted by Leonardo for a peasant,\\nbut retained by his father. Time has dealt hardly with the paint, and\\none has to study minutely before Medusa's horrors are visible. Whether\\nLeonardo's or not, it is not uninteresting to read how the picture\\naffected Shelley when he saw it here in 1819: -- \\n\\n\\n ... Its Horror and its Beauty are divine.\\n Upon its lips and eyelids seem to lie\\n Loveliness like a shadow, from which shine,\\n Fiery and lurid, struggling underneath,\\n The agonies of anguish and of death.\\n\\n\\nThe little room leading from this one should be neglected by no one\\ninterested in Medicean history, for most of the family is here, in\\nminiature, by Bronzino's hand. Here also are miniatures by other great\\npainters, such as Pourbus, Guido Reni, Bassano, Clouet, Holbein. Look\\nparticularly at No. 3382, a woman with brown hair, in purple -- a most\\nfascinating little picture. The Ignota in No. 3348 might easily be\\nHenrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England. The other exhibits\\nare copies in miniature of famous pictures, notable among them a\\nRaphael -- No. 3386 -- and a Breughel -- No. 3445 -- while No. 3341, the\\nrobing of a monk, is worth attention.\\n\\nWe come now to the last pictures of the collection -- in three little\\nrooms at the end, near the bronze sleeping Cupid. Those in the first\\nroom were being rearranged when I was last here; the others contain\\nDutch works notable for a few masterpieces. There are too many\\nPoelenburghs, but the taste shown as a whole is good. Perhaps to\\nthe English enthusiast for painting the fine landscape by Hercules\\nSeghers will, in view of the recent agitation over Lord Lansdowne's\\nRembrandt, \\\"The Mill,\\\" -- ascribed in some quarters to Seghers -- be the\\nmost interesting picture of all. It is a sombre, powerful scene of\\nrugged coast which any artist would have been proud to sign; but it\\nin no way recalls \\\"The Mill's\\\" serene strength. Among the best of\\nits companions are a very good Terburg, a very good Metsu, and an\\nextremely beautiful Ruysdael.\\n\\nAnd so we are at the end of the pictures -- but only to return again and\\nagain -- and are not unwilling to fall into the trap of the official who\\nsits here, and allow him to unlock the door behind the Laoc\\u00f6on group\\nand enjoy what he recommends as a \\\"bella vista\\\" from the open space,\\nwhich turns out to be the roof of the Loggia de' Lanzi. From this\\nhigh point one may see much of Florence and its mountains, while,\\non looking down, over the coping, one finds the busy Piazza della\\nSignoria below, with all its cabs and wayfarers.\\n\\nReturning to the gallery, we come quickly on the right to the first\\nof the neglected statuary rooms, the beautiful Sala di Niobe, which\\ncontains some interesting Medicean and other tapestries, and the\\nsixteen statues of Niobe and her children from the Temple of Apollo,\\nwhich the Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici acquired, and which were for\\nmany years at the Villa Medici at Rome. A suggested reconstruction\\nof the group will be found by the door. I cannot pretend to a deep\\ninterest in the figures, but I like to be in the room. The famous\\nMedicean vase is in the middle of it. Sculpture more ingratiating\\nis close by, in the two rooms given to Iscrizioni: a collection\\nof priceless antiques which are not only beautiful but peculiarly\\ninteresting in that they can be compared with the work of Donatello,\\nVerrocchio, and other of the Renaissance sculptors. For in such a case\\ncomparisons are anything but odious and become fascinating. In the\\nfirst room there is, for example, a Mercury, isolated on the left,\\nin marble, who is a blood relation of Donatello's bronze David in\\nthe Bargello; and certain reliefs of merry children, on the right,\\nlow down, as one approaches the second room, are cousins of the same\\nsculptor's cantoria romps. Not that Donatello ever reproduced the\\nantique spirit as Michelangelo nearly did in his Bacchus, and Sansovino\\nabsolutely did in his Bacchus, both at the Bargello: Donatello was\\nof his time, and the spirit of his time animates his creations, but\\nhe had studied the Greek art in Rome and profited by his lessons,\\nand his evenly-balanced humane mind had a warm corner for pagan\\njoyfulness. Among other statues in this first room is a Sacerdotessa,\\nwearing a marble robe with long folds, whose hands can be seen through\\nthe drapery. Opposite the door are Bacchus and Ampelos, superbly\\npagan, while a sleeping Cupid is most lovely. Among the various fine\\nheads is one of Cicero, of an Unknown -- No. 377 -- and of Homer in bronze\\n(called by the photographers Aristophanes). But each thing in turn is\\nalmost the best. The trouble is that the Uffizi is so vast, and the\\nRenaissance seems to be so eminently the only proper study of mankind\\nwhen one is here, that to attune oneself to the enjoyment of antique\\nsculpture needs a special effort which not all are ready to make.\\n\\nIn the centre of the next room is the punctual Hermaphrodite without\\nwhich no large Continental gallery is complete. But more worthy of\\nattention is the torso of a faun on the left, on a revolving pedestal\\nwhich (unlike those in the Bargello, as we shall discover) really does\\nrevolve and enables you to admire the perfect back. There is also a\\ntorso in basalt or porphyry which one should study from all points,\\nand on the walls some wonderful portions of a frieze from the Ara\\nPacis, erected in Rome, B.C. 139, with wonderful figures of men,\\nwomen, and children on it. Among the heads is a colossal Alexander,\\nvery fine indeed, a beautiful Antoninus, a benign and silly Roman\\nlady in whose existence one can quite believe, and a melancholy\\nSeneca. Look also at Nos. 330 and 332, on the wall: 330, a charming\\ngenius, carrying one of Jove's thunderbolts; and 332, a boy who is\\nsheer Luca della Robbia centuries before his birth.\\n\\nI ought to add that, in addition to the various salons in the Uffizi,\\nthe long corridors are hung with pictures too, in chronological order,\\nthe earliest of all being to the right of the entrance door, and in\\nthe corridors there is also some admirable statuary. But the pictures\\nhere, although not the equals of those in the rooms, receive far too\\nlittle attention, while the sculpture receives even less, whether the\\nbeutiful full-length athletes or the reliefs on the cisterns, several\\nof which have riotous Dionysian processions. On the stairs, too, are\\nsome very beautiful works; while at the top, in the turnstile room, is\\nthe original of the boar which Tacca copied in bronze for the Mercato\\nNuovo, and just outside it are the Medici who were chiefly concerned\\nwith the formation of the collection. On the first landing, nearest\\nthe ground, is a very beautiful and youthful Bacchus. The ceilings\\nof the Uffizi rooms and corridors also are painted, thoughtfully\\nand dexterously, in the Pompeian manner; but there are limits to the\\nreceptive capacity of travellers' eyes, and I must plead guilty to\\nconsistently neglecting them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\\"A\\u00ebrial Fiesole\\\"\\n\\nAndrea del Sarto -- Fiesole sights -- The Villa Palmieri\\nand the \\\"Decameron\\\" -- Botticini's picture in the National\\nGallery -- S. Francesco -- The Roman amphitheatre -- The Etruscan museum -- A\\nsculptor's walk -- The Badia di Fiesole -- Brunelleschi again -- Giovanni\\ndi San Giovanni.\\n\\nAfter all these pictures, how about a little climbing? From so many\\nwindows in Florence, along so many streets, from so many loggias and\\ntowers, and perhaps, above all, from the Piazzale di Michelangelo,\\nFiesole is to be seen on her hill, with the beautiful campanile of\\nher church in the dip between the two eminences, that very soon one\\ncomes to feel that this surely is the promised land. Florence lies\\nso low, and the delectable mountain is so near and so alluring. But\\nI am not sure that to dream of Fiesole as desirable, and to murmur\\nits beautiful syllables, is not best.\\n\\n\\n Let me sit\\nHere by the window with your hand in mine,\\nAnd look a half-hour forth on Fiesole\\n\\n\\n -- that was Andrea's way and not an unwise one. For Fiesole at\\nnearer view can easily disappoint. It is beautifully set on its\\nhill and it has a fascinating past; but the journey thither on\\nfoot is very wearisome, by the electric tram vexatious and noisy,\\nand in a horse-drawn carriage expensive and cruel; and when you\\nare there you become once more a tourist without alleviation and\\nare pestered by beggars, and by nice little girls who ought to\\nknow better, whose peculiar importunacy it is to thrust flowers\\ninto the hand or buttonhole without any denial. What should have\\nbeen a mountain retreat from the city has become a kind of Devil's\\nDyke. But if one is resolute, and, defying all, walks up to the\\nlittle monastery of S. Francesco at the very top of the hill, one\\nmay rest almost undisturbed, with Florence in the valley below, and\\ngardens and vineyards undulating beneath, and a monk or two ascending\\nor descending the steps, and three or four picture-postcard hawkers\\ngambling in a corner, and lizards on the wall. Here it is good to be\\nin the late afternoon, when the light is mellowing; and if you want\\ntea there is a little loggia a few yards down this narrow steep path\\nwhere it may be found. How many beautiful villas in which one could\\nbe happy sunning oneself among the lizards lie between this point\\nand Florence! Who, sitting here, can fail to think that?\\n\\nIn walking to Fiesole one follows the high walls of the Villa Palmieri,\\nwhich is now very private American property, but is famous for ever as\\nthe first refuge of Boccaccio's seven young women and three young men\\nwhen they fled from plague-stricken Florence in 1348 and told tales for\\nten halcyon days. It is now generally agreed that if Boccaccio had any\\nparticular house in his mind it was this. It used to be thought that\\nthe Villa Poggio Gherardo, Mrs. Ross's beautiful home on the way to\\nSettignano, was the first refuge, and the Villa Palmieri the second,\\nbut the latest researches have it that the Palmieri was the first and\\nthe Podere della Fonte, or Villa di Boccaccio, as it is called, near\\nCamerata, a little village below S. Domenico, the other. The Villa\\nPalmieri has another and somewhat different historical association,\\nfor it was there that Queen Victoria resided for a while in 1888. But\\nthe most interesting thing of all about it is the circumstance that\\nit was the home of Matteo Palmieri, the poet, and Botticelli's friend\\nand fellow-speculator on the riddle of life. Palmieri was the author\\nof a remarkable poem called \\\"La Citta della Vita\\\" (The City of Life)\\nwhich developed a scheme of theology that had many attractions to\\nBotticelli's curious mind. The poem was banned by Rome, although\\nnot until after its author's death. In our National Gallery is a\\npicture which used to be considered Botticelli's -- No. 1126, \\\"The\\nAssumption of the Virgin\\\" -- especially as it is mentioned with some\\nparticularity by Vasari, together with the circumstance that the\\npoet and painter devised it in collaboration, in which the poem is\\ntranslated into pigment. As to the theology, I say nothing, nor as to\\nits new ascription to Botticini; but the picture has a greater interest\\nfor us in that it contains a view of Florence with its wall of towers\\naround it in about 1475. The exact spot where the painter sat has been\\nidentified by Miss Stokes in \\\"Six Months in the Apennines\\\". On the\\nleft immediately below the painter's vantage-ground is the Mugnone,\\nwith a bridge over it. On the bank in front is the Villa Palmieri,\\nand on the picture's extreme left is the Badia of Fiesole.\\n\\nOn leaving S. Domenico, if still bent on walking, one should keep\\nstraight on and not follow the tram lines to the right. This is the\\nold and terribly steep road which Lorenzo the Magnificent and his\\nfriends Politian and Pico della Mirandola had to travel whenever they\\nvisited the Medici villa, just under Fiesole, with its drive lined with\\ncypresses. Here must have been great talk and much conviviality. It\\nis now called the Villa McCalmont.\\n\\nOnce at Fiesole, by whatever means you reach it, do not neglect to\\nclimb the monastery steps to the very top. It is a day of climbing,\\nand a hundred or more steps either way mean nothing now. For here\\nis a gentle little church with swift, silent monks in it, and a few\\nflowers in bowls, and a religious picture by that strange Piero di\\nCosimo whose heart was with the gods in exile; and the view of Monte\\nCeceri, on the other side of Fiesole, seen through the cypresses here,\\nwhich could not be better in disposition had Benozzo Gozzoli himself\\narranged them, is very striking and memorable.\\n\\nFiesole's darling son is Mino the sculptor -- the \\\"Raphael of the\\nchisel\\\" -- whose radiant Madonnas and children and delicate tombs may\\nbe seen here and there all over Florence. The piazza is named after\\nhim; he is celebrated on a marble slab outside the museum, where all\\nthe famous names of the vicinity may be read too; and in the church\\nis one of his most charming groups and finest heads. They are in a\\nlittle chapel on the right of the choir. The head is that of Bishop\\nSalutati, humorous, wise, and benign, and the group represents the\\nadoration of a merry little Christ by a merry little S. John and\\nothers. As for the church itself, it is severe and cool, with such\\nstone columns in it as must last for ever.\\n\\nBut the main interest of Fiesole to most people is not the\\ncypress-covered hill of S. Francesco; not the view from the summit;\\nnot the straw mementoes; not the Mino relief in the church; but\\nthe Roman arena. The excavators have made of this a very complete\\nplace. One can stand at the top of the steps and reconstruct it\\nall -- the audience, the performance, the performers. A very little time\\nspent on building would be needed to restore the amphitheatre to its\\noriginal form. Beyond it are baths, and in a hollow the remains of a\\ntemple with the altar where it ever was; and then one walks a little\\nfarther and is on the ancient Etruscan wall, built when Fiesole was an\\nEtruscan fortified hill city. So do the centuries fall away here! But\\neverywhere, among the ancient Roman stones so massive and exact,\\nand the Etruscan stones, are the wild flowers which Luca Signorelli\\npainted in that picture in the Uffizi which I love so much.\\n\\nAfter the amphitheatre one visits the Museum -- with the same ticket -- a\\nlittle building filled with trophies of the spade. There is nothing\\nvery wonderful -- nothing to compare with the treasures of the\\nArchaeological Museum in Florence -- but it is well worth a visit.\\n\\nOn leaving the Museum on the last occasion that I was there -- in\\nApril -- I walked to Settignano. The road for a while is between\\nhouses, for Fiesole stretches a long way farther than one suspects,\\nvery high, looking over the valley of the Mugnone; and then after a\\nperiod between pine trees and grape-hyacinths one turns to the right\\nand begins to descend. Until Poggio del Castello, a noble villa,\\non an isolated eminence, the descent is very gradual, with views of\\nFlorence round the shoulder of Monte Ceceri; but afterwards the road\\nwinds, to ease the fall, and the wayfarer turns off into the woods and\\ntumbles down the hill by a dry water-course, amid crags and stones,\\nto the beginnings of civilization again, at the Via di Desiderio da\\nSettignano, a sculptor who stands to his native town in precisely\\nthe same relation as Mino to his.\\n\\nSettignano is a mere village, with villas all about it, and\\nthe thing to remember there is not only that Desiderio was born\\nthere but that Michelangelo's foster-mother was the wife of a\\nlocal stone-cutter -- stone-cutting at that time being the staple\\nindustry. On the way back to Florence in the tram, one passes on the\\nright a gateway surmounted by statues of the poets, the Villa Poggio\\nGherardo, of which I have spoken earlier in the chapter. There is no\\nvilla with a nobler mien than this.\\n\\nThat is one walk from Fiesole. Another is even more a sculptors' way:\\nfor it would include Maiano too, where Benedetto was born. The road\\nis by way of the tram lines to that acute angle just below Fiesole\\nwhen they turn back to S. Domenico, and so straight on down the hill.\\n\\nBut if one is returning to Florence direct after leaving Fiesole it\\nis well to walk down the precipitous paths to S. Domenico, and before\\nagain taking the tram visit the Badia overlooking the valley of the\\nMugnone. This is done by turning to the right just opposite the church\\nof S. Domenico, which has little interest structurally but is famous\\nas being the chapel of the monastery where Fra Angelico was once a\\nmonk. The Badia (Abbey) di Fiesole, as it now is, was built on the\\nsite of an older monastery, by Cosimo Pater. Here Marsilio Ficino's\\nPlatonic Academy used to meet, in the loggia and in the little temple\\nwhich one gains from the cloisters, and here Pico della Mirandola\\ncomposed his curious gloss on Genesis.\\n\\nThe dilapidated marble fa\\u00e7ade of the church and its rugged stone-work\\nare exceedingly ancient -- dating in fact from the eleventh century;\\nthe new building is by Brunelleschi and to my mind is one of his\\nmost beautiful works, its lovely proportions and cool, unfretted\\nwhite spaces communicating even more pleasure than the Pazzi chapel\\nitself. The decoration has been kept simple and severe, and the colour\\nis just the grey pietra serena of Fiesole, of which the lovely arches\\nare made, all most exquisitely chiselled, and the pure white of the\\nwalls and ceilings. This church was a favourite with the Medici, and\\nthe youthful Giovanni, the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, received\\nhis cardinal's hat here in 1492, at the age of sixteen. He afterwards\\nbecame Pope Leo X. How many of the boys, now in the school -- for the\\nmonastery has become a Jesuit school -- will, one wonders, rise to\\nsimilar eminence.\\n\\nIn the beautiful cloisters we have the same colour scheme as\\nin the church, and here again Brunelleschi's miraculous genius\\nfor proportion is to be found. Here and there are foliations and\\nother exquisite tracery by pupils of Desiderio da Settignano. The\\nrefectory has a high-spirited fresco by that artist whose room in\\nthe Uffizi is so carefully avoided by discreet chaperons -- Giovanni di\\nSan Giovanni -- representing Christ eating at a table, his ministrants\\nbeing a crowd of little roguish angels and cherubim, one of whom (on\\nthe right) is in despair at having broken a plate. In the entrance\\nlobby is a lavabo by Mino da Fiesole, with two little boys of the\\nwhitest and softest marble on it, which is worth study.\\n\\nAnd now we will return to the heart of Florence once more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nThe Badia and Dante\\n\\nFilippino Lippi -- Buffalmacco -- Mino da Fiesole -- The Dante quarter -- Dante\\nand Beatrice -- Monna Tessa -- Gemma Donati -- Dante in exile -- Dante\\nmemorials in Florence -- The Torre della Castagna -- The Borgo degli\\nAlbizzi and the old palaces -- S. Ambrogio -- Mino's tabernacle -- Wayside\\nmasterpieces -- S. Egidio.\\n\\nOpposite the Bargello is a church with a very beautiful doorway\\ndesigned by Benedetto da Rovezzano. This church is known as the Badia,\\nand its delicate spire is a joy in the landscape from every point of\\nvantage. The Badia is very ancient, but the restorers have been busy\\nand little of Arnolfo's thirteenth-century work is left. It is chiefly\\nfamous now for its Filippino Lippi and two tombs by Mino da Fiesole,\\nbut historically it is interesting as being the burial-place of the\\nchief Florentine families in the Middle Ages and as being the scene\\nof Boccaccio's lectures on Dante in 1373. The Filippino altar-piece,\\nwhich represents S. Bernard's Vision of the Virgin (a subject we shall\\nsee treated very beautifully by Fra Bartolommeo at the Accademia)\\nis one of the most perfect and charming pictures by this artist:\\nvery grave and real and sweet, and the saint's hands exquisitely\\npainted. The figure praying in the right-hand corner is the patron,\\nPiero di Francesco del Pugliese, who commissioned this picture for the\\nchurch of La Campora, outside the Porta Romana, where it was honoured\\nuntil 1529, when Clement VII's troops advancing, it was brought here\\nfor safety and has here remained.\\n\\nClose by -- in the same chapel -- is a little door which the sacristan\\nwill open, disclosing a portion of Arnolfo's building with perishing\\nfrescoes which are attributed to Buffalmacco, an artist as to whose\\nreality much scepticism prevails. They are not in themselves of much\\ninterest, although the sacristan's eagerness should not be discouraged;\\nbut Buffalmacco being Boccaccio's, Sacchetti's, Vasari's (and, later,\\nAnatole France's) amusing hero, it is pleasant to look at his work and\\nthink of his freakishness. Buffalmacco (if he ever existed) was one\\nof the earlier painters, flourishing between 1311 and 1350, and was\\na pupil of Andrea Tafi. This simple man he plagued very divertingly,\\nonce frightening him clean out of his house by fixing little lighted\\ncandles to the backs of beetles and steering them into Tafi's bedroom\\nat night. Tafi was terrified, but on being told by Buffalmacco (who was\\na lazy rascal) that these devils were merely showing their objection\\nto early rising, he became calm again, and agreed to lie in bed to\\na reasonable hour. Cupidity, however, conquering, he again ordered\\nhis pupil to be up betimes, when the beetles again re-appeared and\\ncontinued to do so until the order was revoked.\\n\\nThe sculptor Mino da Fiesole, whom we shall shortly see again, at the\\nBargello, in portrait busts and Madonna reliefs, is at his best here,\\nin the superb monument to Count Ugo, who founded, with his mother,\\nthe Benedictine Abbey of which the Badia is the relic. Here all Mino's\\nsweet thoughts, gaiety and charm are apparent, together with the\\nperfection of radiant workmanship. The quiet dignity of the recumbent\\nfigure is no less masterly than the group above it. Note the impulsive\\nurgency of the splendid Charity, with her two babies, and the quiet\\nbeauty of the Madonna and Child above all, while the proportions and\\ndelicate patterns of the tomb as a whole still remain to excite one's\\npleasure and admiration. We shall see many tombs in Florence -- few not\\nbeautiful -- but none more joyously accomplished than this. The tomb\\nof Carlo Marsuppini in S. Croce by Desiderio da Settignano, which\\nawaits us, was undoubtedly the parent of the Ugo, Mino following his\\nmaster very closely; but his charm was his own. According to Vasari,\\nthe Ugo tomb was considered to be Mino's finest achievement, and he\\ndeliberately made the Madonna and Child as like the types of his\\nbeloved Desiderio as he could. It was finished in 1481, and Mino\\ndied in 1484, from a chill following over-exertion in moving heavy\\nstones. Mino also has here a monument to Bernardo Giugni, a famous\\ngonfalonier in the time of Cosimo de' Medici, marked by the same\\ndistinction, but not quite so memorable. The Ugo is his masterpiece.\\n\\nThe carved wooden ceiling, which is a very wonderful piece of work\\nand of the deepest and most glorious hue, should not be forgotten;\\nbut nothing is easier than to overlook ceilings.\\n\\nThe cloisters are small, but they atone for that -- if it is a fault -- by\\nhaving a loggia. From the loggia the top of the noble tower of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio is seen to perfection. Upon the upper walls is a\\nseries of frescoes illustrating the life of S. Benedict which must\\nhave been very gay and spirited once but are now faded.\\n\\nThe Badia may be said to be the heart of the Dante quarter. Dante must\\noften have been in the church before it was restored as we now see it,\\nand a quotation from the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\" is on its fa\\u00e7ade. The Via\\nDante and the Piazza Donati are close by, and in the Via Dante are many\\nreminders of the poet besides his alleged birthplace. Elsewhere in the\\ncity we find incised quotations from his poem; but the Baptistery -- his\\n\\\"beautiful San Giovanni\\\" -- is the only building in the city proper now\\nremaining which Dante would feel at home in could he return to it, and\\nwhere we can feel assured of sharing his presence. The same pavement is\\nthere on which his feet once stood, and on the same mosaic of Christ\\nabove the altar would his eyes have fallen. When Dante was exiled in\\n1302 the cathedral had been in progress only for six or eight years;\\nbut it is known that he took the deepest interest in its construction,\\nand we have seen the stone marking the place where he sat, watching\\nthe builders. The fa\\u00e7ade of the Badia of Fiesole and the church of\\nS. Miniato can also remember Dante; no others.\\n\\nHere, however, we are on that ground which is richest in personal\\nassociations with him and his, for in spite of re-building and\\ncertain modern changes the air is heavy with antiquity in these\\nnarrow streets and passages where the poet had his childhood and\\nyouth. The son of a lawyer named Alighieri, Dante was born in\\n1265, but whether or not in this Casa Dante is an open question,\\nand it was in the Baptistery that he received the name of Durante,\\nafterwards abbreviated to Dante -- Durante meaning enduring, and Dante\\ngiving. Those who have read the \\\"Vita Nuova,\\\" either in the original\\nor in Rossetti's translation, may be surprised to learn that the\\nboy was only nine when he first met his Beatrice, who was seven,\\nand for ever passed into bondage to her. Who Beatrice was is again\\na mystery, but it has been agreed to consider her in real life a\\ndaughter of Folco Portinari, a wealthy Florentine and the founder of\\nthe hospital of S. Maria Nuova, one of whose descendants commissioned\\nHugo van der Goes to paint the great triptych in the Uffizi. Folco's\\ntomb is in S. Egidio, the hospital church, while in the passage to\\nthe cloisters is a stone figure of Monna Tessa (of whom we are about\\nto see a coloured bust in the Bargello), who was not only Beatrice's\\nnurse (if Beatrice were truly of the Portinari) but the instigator,\\nit is said, of Folco's deed of charity.\\n\\nOf Dante's rapt adoration of his lady, the \\\"Vita Nuova\\\"\\ntells. According to that strangest monument of devotion it was not\\nuntil another nine years had passed that he had speech of her; and\\nthen Beatrice, meeting him in the street, saluted him as she passed\\nhim with such ineffable courtesy and grace that he was lifted into a\\nseventh heaven of devotion and set upon the writing of his book. The\\ntwo seem to have had no closer intercourse: Beatrice shone distantly\\nlike a star and her lover worshipped her with increasing loyalty\\nand fervour, overlaying the idea of her, as one might say, with gold\\nand radiance, very much as we shall see Fra Angelico adding glory to\\nthe Madonna and Saints in his pictures, and with a similar intensity\\nof ecstasy. Then one day Beatrice married, and not long afterwards,\\nbeing always very fragile, she died, at the age of twenty-three. The\\nfact that she was no longer on earth hardly affected her poet,\\nwhose worship of her had always so little of a physical character;\\nand she continued to dominate his thoughts.\\n\\nIn 1293, however, Dante married, one Gemma Donati of the powerful\\nGuelph family of that name, of which Corso Donati was the turbulent\\nhead; and by her he had many children. For Gemma, however, he seems\\nto have had no affection; and when in 1301 he left Florence, never to\\nreturn, he left his wife for ever too. In 1289 Dante had been present\\nat the battle of Campaldino, fighting with the Guelphs against the\\nGhibellines, and on settling down in Florence and taking to politics it\\nwas as a Guelph, or rather as one of that branch of the Guelph party\\nwhich had become White -- the Bianchi -- as opposed to the other party\\nwhich was Black -- the Neri. The feuds between these divisions took the\\nplace of those between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, since Florence\\nwas never happy without internal strife, and it cannot have added\\nto Dante's home comfort that his wife was related to Corso Donati,\\nwho led the Neri and swaggered in his bullying way about the city with\\nproprietary, intolerant airs that must have been infuriating to a man\\nwith Dante's stern sense of right and justice. It was Corso who brought\\nabout Dante's exile; but he himself survived only six years, and was\\nthen killed, by his own wish, on his way to execution, rather than be\\nhumiliated in the city in which he had swayed. Dante, whose genius\\ndevised a more lasting form of reprisal than any personal encounter\\ncould be, has depicted him in the \\\"Purgatorio\\\" as on the road to Hell.\\n\\nBut this is going too fast. In 1300, when Dante was thirty-five,\\nhe was sufficiently important to be made one of the six priors of\\nthe city, and in that capacity was called upon to quell a Neri and\\nBianchi disturbance. It is characteristic of him that he was a party\\nto the banishment of the leaders of both factions, among whom was\\nhis closest friend, Guido Cavalcanti the poet, who was one of the\\nBianchi. Whether it was because of Guide's illness in his exile, or\\nfrom what motive, we shall not know; but the sentence was lightened in\\nthe case of this Bianco, a circumstance which did not add to Dante's\\nchances when the Neri, having plotted successfully with Charles of\\nValois, captured supreme power in Florence. This was in the year 1301,\\nDante being absent from that city on an embassy to Rome to obtain help\\nfor the Bianchi. He never came back; for the Neri plans succeeded;\\nthe Neri assumed control; and in January, 1302, he was formally fined\\nand banished. The nominal charge against him was of misappropriating\\nfunds while a prior; but that was merely a matter of form. His real\\noffence was in being one of the Bianchi, an enemy of the Neri, and\\na man of parts.\\n\\nIn the rest of Dante's life Florence had no part, except in his\\nthoughts. How he viewed her the \\\"Divine Comedy\\\" tells us, and that he\\nlonged to return we also know. The chance was indeed once offered,\\nbut under the impossible condition that he should do public penance\\nin the Baptistery for his offence. This he refused. He wandered here\\nand there, and settled finally in Ravenna, where he died in 1321. The\\n\\\"Divine Comedy\\\" anticipating printing by so many years -- the invention\\ndid not reach Florence until 1471 -- Dante could not make much popular\\nway as a poet before that time; but to his genius certain Florentines\\nwere earlier no strangers, not only by perusing MS. copies of his\\ngreat work, which by its richness in Florentine allusions excited\\nan interest apart altogether from that created by its beauty, but by\\npublic lectures on the poem, delivered in the churches by order of\\nthe Signoria. The first Dante professor to be appointed was Giovanni\\nBoccaccio, the author of the \\\"Decameron,\\\" who was born in 1313,\\neight years before Dante's death, and became an enthusiast upon the\\npoet. The picture in the Duomo was placed there in 1465. Then came\\nprinting to Florence and Dante passed quickly into his countrymen's\\nthoughts and language.\\n\\nMichelangelo, who was born in time -- 1475 -- to enjoy in Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent's house the new and precious advantage of printed books,\\nbecame as a boy a profound student of the poet, and when later an\\nappeal was made from Florence to the Pope to sanction the removal of\\nDante's bones to Florence, Michelangelo was among the signatories. But\\nit was not done. His death-mask from Ravenna is in the Bargello:\\na few of his bones and their coffin are still in Ravenna, in the\\nmonastery of Classe, piously preserved in a room filled with Dante\\nrelics and literature; his tomb is elsewhere at Ravenna, a shrine\\nvisited by thousands every year.\\n\\nEver since has Dante's fame been growing, so that only the Bible has\\nled to more literature; and to-day Florence is more proud of him than\\nany of her sons, except perhaps Michelangelo. We have seen one or\\ntwo reminders of him already; more are here where we stand. We have\\nseen the picture in honour of him which the Republic set up in the\\ncathedral; his head on a beautiful inlaid door in the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nthe building where his sentence of banishment was devised and carried,\\nto be followed by death sentence thrice repeated (burning alive,\\nto be exact); and we have seen the head-quarters of the Florentine\\nDante society in the guild house at Or San Michele. We have still\\nto see his statue opposite S. Croce, another fresco head in S. Maria\\nNovella, certain holograph relics at the library at S. Lorenzo, and\\nhis head again by his friend Giotto, in the Bargello, where he would\\nhave been confined while waiting for death had he been captured.\\n\\nDante's house has been rebuilt, very recently, and next to it is a\\nnewer building still, with a long inscription in Italian upon it,\\nto the effect that the residence of Bella and Bellincione Alighieri\\nstood hereabouts, and in that abode was Dante born. The Commune of\\nFlorence, it goes on to say, having secured possession of the site,\\n\\\"built this edifice on the remains of the ancestral house as fresh\\nevidence of the public veneration of the divine poet\\\". The Torre della\\nCastagna, across the way, has an inscription in Italian, which may be\\ntranslated thus: \\\"This Tower, the so-called Tower of the Chestnut, is\\nthe solitary remnant of the head-quarters from which the Priors of the\\nArts governed Florence, before the power and glory of the Florentine\\nCommune procured the erection of the Palace of the Signoria\\\".\\n\\nFew persons in the real city of Florence, it may be said confidently,\\nlive in a house built for them; but hereabouts none at all. In fact,\\nit is the exception anywhere near the centre of the city to live in\\na house built less than three centuries ago. Palaces abound, cut up\\ninto offices, flats, rooms, and even cinema theatres. The telegraph\\noffice in the Via del Proconsolo is a palace commissioned by the\\nStrozzi but never completed: hence its name, Nonfinito; next it is\\nthe superb Palazzo Quaratesi, which Brunelleschi designed, now the\\nhead-quarters of a score of firms and an Ecclesiastical School whence\\nsounds of sacred song continually emerge.\\n\\nSince we have Mino da Fiesole in our minds and are on the subject\\nof old palaces let us walk from the Dante quarter in a straight line\\nfrom the Corso, that very busy street of small shops, across the Via\\ndel Proconsolo and down the Borgo degli Albizzi to S. Ambrogio, where\\nMino was buried. This Borgo is a street of palaces and an excellent one\\nin which to reflect upon the strange habit which wealthy Florentines\\nthen indulged of setting their mansions within a few feet of those\\nopposite. Houses -- or rather fortresses -- that must have cost fortunes\\nand have been occupied by families of wealth and splendour were\\nerected so close to their vis-\\u00e0-vis that two carts could not pass\\nabreast between them. Side by side contiguity one can understand,\\nbut not this other adjacence. Every ground floor window is barred\\nlike a gaol. Those bars tell us something of the perils of life in\\nFlorence in the great days of faction ambition; while the thickness\\nof the walls and solidity of construction tell us something too of\\nthe integrity of the Florentine builders. These ancient palaces,\\none feels, whatever may happen to them, can never fall to ruin. Such\\nstones as are placed one upon the other in the Pitti and the Strozzi\\nand the Riccardi nothing can displace. It is an odd thought that\\nseveral Florentine palaces and villas built before Columbus sailed\\nfor America are now occupied by rich Americans, some of them draw\\npossibly much of their income from the manufacture of steel girders\\nfor sky-scrapers. These ancient streets with their stern and sombre\\npalaces specially touched the imagination of Dickens when he was in\\nFlorence in 1844, but in his \\\"Pictures from Italy\\\" he gave the city\\nonly fugitive mention. The old prison, which then adjoined the Palazzo\\nVecchio, and in which the prisoners could be seen, also moved him.\\n\\nThe Borgo degli Albizzi, as I have said, is crowded with\\nPalazzi. No. 24 -- and there is something very incongruous in palaces\\nhaving numbers at all -- is memorable in history as being one of the\\nhomes of the Pazzi family who organized the conspiracy against the\\nMedici in 1478, as I have related in the second chapter, and failed\\nso completely. Donatello designed the coat of arms here. The palace\\nat No. 18 belonged to the Altoviti. No. 12 is the Palazzo Albizzi,\\nthe residence of one of the most powerful of the Florentine families,\\nwhose allies were all about them in this quarter, as it was wise to be.\\n\\nAs a change from picture galleries, I can think of nothing more\\ndelightful than to wander about these ancient streets, and, wherever a\\ncourtyard or garden shines, penetrate to it; stopping now and again to\\nenjoy the vista, the red Duomo, or Giotto's tower, so often mounting\\ninto the sky at one end, or an indigo Apennine at the other. Standing\\nin the middle of the Via Ricasoli, for example, one has sight of both.\\n\\nAt the Piazza S. Pietro we see one of the old towers of Florence,\\nof which there were once so many, into which the women and children\\nmight retreat in times of great danger, and here too is a series of\\narches which fruit and vegetable shops make gay.\\n\\nThe next Piazza is that of S. Ambrogio. This church is interesting\\nnot only for doing its work in a poor quarter -- one has the feeling at\\nonce that it is a right church in the right place -- but as containing,\\nas I have said, the grave of Mino da Fiesole: Mino de' Poppi detto da\\nFiesole, as the floor tablet has it. Over the altar of Mino's little\\nchapel is a large tabernacle from his hand, in which the gayest little\\nBoy gives the benediction, own brother to that one by Desiderio at\\nS. Lorenzo. The tabernacle must be one of the master's finest works,\\nand beneath it is a relief in which a priest pours something -- perhaps\\nthe very blood of Christ which is kept here -- from one chalice to\\nanother held by a kneeling woman, surrounded by other kneeling women,\\nwhich is a marvel of flowing beauty and life. The lines of it are\\npeculiarly lovely.\\n\\nOn the wall of the same little chapel is a fresco by Cosimo Rosselli\\nwhich must once have been a delight, representing a procession of\\nCorpus Christi -- this chapel being dedicated to the miracle of the\\nSacrament -- and it contains, according to Vasari, a speaking likeness of\\nPico della Mirandola. Other graves in the church are those of Cronaca,\\nthe architect of the Palazzo Vecchio's great Council Room, a friend\\nof Savonarola and Rosselli's nephew by marriage; and Verrocchio, the\\nsculptor, whose beautiful work we are now to see in the Bargello. It\\nis said that Lorenzo di Credi also lies here, and Albertinelli,\\nwho gave up the brush for innkeeping.\\n\\nOpposite the church, on a house at the corner of the Borgo S. Croce\\nand the Via de' Macci, is a della Robbia saint -- one of many such\\nmural works of art in Florence. Thus, at the corner of the Via Cavour\\nand the Via de' Pucci, opposite the Riccardi palace, is a beautiful\\nMadonna and Child by Donatello. In the Via Zannetti, which leads\\nout of the Via Cerretani, is a very pretty example by Mino, a few\\nhouses on the right. These are sculpture. And everywhere in the older\\nstreets you may see shrines built into the wall: there is even one in\\nthe prison, in the Via dell' Agnolo, once the convent of the Murate,\\nwhere Catherine de' Medici was imprisoned as a girl; but many of them\\nare covered with glass which has been allowed to become black.\\n\\nA word or two on S. Egidio, the church of the great hospital of\\nS. Maria Nuova, might round off this chapter, since it was Folco\\nPortinari, Beatrice's father, who founded it. The hospital stands\\nin a rather forlorn square a few steps from the Duomo, down the Via\\ndell' Orivolo and then the first to the left; and it extends right\\nthrough to the Via degli Alfani in cloisters and ramifications. The\\nfa\\u00e7ade is in a state of decay, old frescoes peeling off it, but one\\npicture has been enclosed for protection -- a gay and busy scene of the\\nconsecration of the church by Pope Martin V. Within, it is a church\\nof the poor, notable for its general florid comfort (comparatively)\\nand Folco's gothic tomb. In the chancel is a pretty little tabernacle\\nby Mino, which used to have a bronze door by Ghiberti, but has it no\\nlonger, and a very fine della Robbia Madonna and Child, probably by\\nAndrea. Behind a grille, upstairs, sit the hospital nurses. In the\\nadjoining cloisters -- one of the high roads to the hospital proper -- is\\nthe ancient statue of old Monna Tessa, Beatrice's nurse, and, in a\\nniche, a pretty symbolical painting of Charity by that curious painter\\nGiovanni di San Giovanni. It was in the hospital that the famous Van\\nder Goes triptych used to hang.\\n\\nA tablet on a house opposite S. Egidio, a little to the right,\\nstates that it was there that Ghiberti made the Baptistery gates\\nwhich Michelangelo considered fit to be the portals of Paradise.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nThe Bargello\\n\\nPlastic art -- Blood-soaked stones -- The faithful\\nartists -- Michelangelo -- Italian custodians -- The famous\\nDavids -- Michelangelo's tondo -- Brutus -- Benedetto da\\nRovezzano -- Donatello's life-work -- The S. George -- Verrocchio -- Ghiberti\\nand Brunelleschi and the Baptistery doors -- Benvenuto Cellini -- John of\\nBologna -- Antonio Pollaiuolo -- Verrocchio again -- Mino da Fiesole -- The\\nFlorentine wealth of sculpture -- Beautiful ladies -- The della\\nRobbias -- South Kensington and the Louvre.\\n\\nBefore my last visit but one to Florence, plastic art was less\\nattractive to me than pictorial art. But now I am not sure. At\\nany rate when, here in England, I think of Florence, as so often\\nI do, I find myself visiting in imagination the Bargello before the\\nUffizi. Pictures in any number can bewilder and dazzle as much as they\\ndelight. The eye tires. And so, it is true, can a multiplicity of\\nantique statuary such as one finds at the Vatican or at the Louvre;\\nbut a small collection of Renaissance work, so soft and human,\\nas at the Bargello, is not only joy-giving but refreshing too. The\\nsoft contours soothe as well as enrapture the eye: the tenderness of\\nthe Madonnas, the gentleness of the Florentine ladies and youths, as\\nVerrocchio and Mino da Fiesole, Donatello, and Pollaiuolo moulded them,\\ncalm one where the perfection of Phidias and Praxiteles excites. Hence\\nthe very special charm of the Bargello, whose plastic treasures are\\ncomparatively few and picked, as against the heaped profusion of paint\\nin the Uffizi and the Pitti. It pairs off rather with the Accademia,\\nand has this further point in common with that choicest of galleries,\\nthat Michelangelo's chisel is represented in both.\\n\\nThe Bargello is at the corner of the Via Ghibellina in the narrow\\nVia del Proconsolo -- so narrow that if you take one step off the\\npavement a tram may easily sweep you into eternity; so narrow also\\nthat the real dignity of the Bargello is never to be properly seen,\\nand one thinks of it rather for its inner court and staircase and\\nits strong tower than for its massive fa\\u00e7ades. Its history is soaked\\nin blood. It was built in the middle of the thirteenth century as the\\nresidence of the chief magistrate of the city, the Capitano del popolo,\\nor Podest\\u00e0, first appointed soon after the return of the Guelphs in\\n1251, and it so remained, with such natural Florentine vicissitudes\\nas destruction by mobs and fire, for four hundred years, when, in\\n1574, it was converted into a prison and place of execution and the\\nhead-quarters of the police, and changed its name from the Palazzo\\ndel Podest\\u00e0 to that by which it is now known, so called after the\\nBargello, or chief of the police.\\n\\nIt is indeed fortunate that no rioters succeeded in obliterating\\nGiotto's fresco in the Bargello chapel, which he painted probably in\\n1300, when his friend Dante was a Prior of the city. Giotto introduced\\nthe portrait of Dante which has drawn so many people to this little\\nroom, together with portraits of Corso Donati, and Brunetto Latini,\\nDante's tutor. Whitewash covered it for two centuries. Dante's head\\nhas been restored.\\n\\nIt was in 1857 that the Bargello was again converted, this time to its\\npresent gracious office of preserving the very flower of Renaissance\\nplastic art.\\n\\nPassing through the entrance hall, which has a remarkable collection of\\nMedicean armour and weapons, and in which (I have read but not seen)\\nis an oubliette under one of the great pillars, the famous court is\\ngained and the famous staircase. Of this court what can I say? Its\\nquality is not to be communicated in words; and even the photographs of\\nit that are sold have to be made from pictures, which the assiduous\\nSignor Giuliani, among others, is always so faithfully painting,\\nstone for stone. One forgets all the horrors that once were enacted\\nhere -- the execution of honourable Florentine patriots whose only\\noffence was that in their service of this proud and beautiful city they\\ndiffered from those in power; one thinks only of the soft light on the\\nimmemorial walls, the sturdy graceful columns, the carved escutcheons,\\nthe resolute steps, the spaciousness and stern calm of it all.\\n\\nIn the colonnade are a number of statues, the most famous of which\\nis perhaps the \\\"Dying Adonis\\\" which Baedeker gives to Michelangelo\\nbut the curator to Vincenzo di Rossi; an ascription that would annoy\\nMichelangelo exceedingly, if it were a mistake, since Rossi was a\\npupil of his enemy, the absurd Bandinelli. Mr. W.G. Waters, in his\\n\\\"Italian Sculptors,\\\" considers not only that Michelangelo was the\\nsculptor, but that the work was intended to form part of the tomb of\\nPope Julius. In the second room opposite the main entrance across the\\ncourtyard, we come however to Michelangelo authentic and supreme,\\nfor here are his small David, his Brutus, his Bacchus, and a tondo\\nof the Madonna and Child.\\n\\nAccording to Baedeker the Bacchus and the David revolve. Certainly they\\nare on revolving stands, but to say that they revolve is to disregard\\nutterly the character of the Italian official. A catch holds each in\\nits place, and any effort to release this or to induce the custodian to\\nrelease it is equally futile. \\\"Chiuso\\\" (closed), he replies, and that\\nis final. Useless to explain that the backs of statues can be beautiful\\nas the front; that one of the triumphs of great statuary is its equal\\nperfection from every point; that the revolving stand was not made\\nfor a joke but for a serious purpose. \\\"Chiuso,\\\" he replies. The museum\\ncustodians of Italy are either like this -- jaded figures of apathy -- or\\nthey are enthusiasts. To each enthusiast there are ninety-nine of the\\nother, who either sit in a kind of stupor and watch you with sullen\\nsuspicion, or clear their throats as no gentleman should. The result\\nis that when one meets the enthusiasts one remembers them. There is\\na little dark fellow in the Brera at Milan whose zeal in displaying\\nthe merits of Mantegna's foreshortened Christ is as unforgettable as\\na striking piece of character-acting in a theatre. There is a more\\nreserved but hardly less appreciative official in the Accademia at\\nBologna with a genuine if incommunicable passion for Guido Reni. And,\\nlastly, there is Alfred Branconi, at S. Croce, with his continual and\\nrapturous \\\"It is faine! It is faine!\\\" but he is a private guide. The\\nBargello custodians belong to the other camp.\\n\\nThe fondness of sculptors for David as a subject is due to the fact\\nthat the Florentines, who had spent so much of their time under\\ntyrants and so much of their blood in resisting them, were captivated\\nby the idea of this stripling freeing his compatriots from Goliath\\nand the Philistines. David, as I have said in my remarks on the\\nPiazza della Signoria, stood to them, with Judith, as a champion of\\nliberty. He was alluring also on account of his youth, so attractive\\nto Renaissance sculptors and poets, and the Florentines' admiration\\nwas not diminished by the circumstance that his task was a singularly\\nlight one, since he never came to close quarters with his antagonist\\nat all and had the Lord of Hosts on his side. A David of mythology,\\nPerseus, another Florentine hero, a stripling with what looked like\\na formidable enemy, also enjoyed supernatural assistance.\\n\\nDavid appealed to the greatest sculptors of all -- to Michelangelo,\\nto Donatello, and to Verrocchio; and Michelangelo made two figures,\\none of which is here and the other at the Accademia, and Donatello\\ntwo figures, both of which are here, so that, Verrocchio's example\\nbeing also here, very interesting comparisons are possible.\\n\\nPersonally I put Michelangelo's small David first; it is the one\\nin which, apart from its beauty, you can best believe. His colossal\\nDavid seems to me one of the most glorious things in the world; but it\\nis not David; not the simple, ruddy shepherd lad of the Bible. This\\nDavid could obviously defeat anybody. Donatello's more famous David,\\nin the hat, upstairs, is the most charming creature you ever saw,\\nbut it had been far better to call him something else. Both he and\\nVerrocchio's David, also upstairs, are young tournament nobles rather\\nthan shepherd lads who have slung a stone at a Philistine bully. I see\\nthem both -- but particularly perhaps Verrocchio's -- in the intervals of\\nstrife most acceptably holding up a lady's train, or lying at her feet\\nreading one of Boccaccio's stories; neither could ever have watched\\na flock. Donatello's second David, behind the more famous one, has\\nmore reality; but I would put Michelangelo's smaller one first. And\\nwhat beautiful marble it is -- so rich and warm!\\n\\nOne point which both Donatello's and Verrocchio's David emphasizes\\nis the gulf that was fixed between the Biblical and religious\\nconception of the youthful psalmist and that of these sculptors of the\\nRenaissance. One can, indeed, never think of Donatello as a religious\\nartist. Serious, yes; but not religious, or at any rate not religious\\nin the too common sense of the word, in the sense of appertaining\\nto a special reverential mood distinguished from ordinary moods of\\ndailiness. His David, as I have said, is a comely, cultured boy,\\nwho belongs to the very flower of chivalry and romance. Verrocchio's\\nis akin to him, but he has less radiant mastery. Donatello's David\\nmight be the young lord; Verrocchio's, his page. Here we see the new\\nspirit, the Renaissance, at work, for though religion called it into\\nbeing and the Church continued to be its patron, it rapidly divided\\ninto two halves, and while the painters were bringing all their\\ngenius to glorify sacred history, the scholars were endeavouring to\\nhumanize it. In this task they had no such allies as the sculptors,\\nand particularly Donatello, who, always thinking independently and\\nvigorously, was their best friend. Donatello's David fought also more\\npowerfully for the modern spirit (had he known it) than ever he could\\nhave done in real life with such a large sword in such delicate hands;\\nfor by being the first nude statue of a Biblical character, he made\\nsimpler the way to all humanists in whatever medium they worked.\\n\\nMichelangelo was not often tender. Profoundly sad he could be: indeed\\nhis own head, in bronze, at the Accademia, might stand for melancholy\\nand bitter world-knowledge; but seldom tender; yet the Madonna and\\nChild in the circular bas-relief in this ground-floor room have\\nsomething very nigh tenderness, and a greatness that none of the\\nother Italian sculptors, however often they attempted this subject,\\never reached. The head of Mary in this relief is, I think, one of the\\nmost beautiful things in Florence, none the less so for the charming\\nhead-dress which the great austere artist has given her. The Child\\nis older than is usual in such groups, and differs in another way,\\nfor tiring of a reading lesson, He has laid His arm upon the book:\\na pretty touch.\\n\\nMichelangelo's Bacchus, an early work, is opposite. It is a remarkable\\nproof of his extraordinary range that the same little room should\\ncontain the David, the Madonna, the Brutus, and the Bacchus. In\\nDavid one can believe, as I have said, as the young serious stalwart\\nof the Book of Kings. The Madonna, although perhaps a shade too\\nintellectual -- or at any rate more intellectual and commanding than\\nthe other great artists have accustomed us to think of her -- has a\\nsweet gravity and power and almost domestic tenderness. The Brutus\\nis powerful and modern and realistic; while Bacchus is steeped in the\\nGreek spirit, and the little faun hiding behind him is the very essence\\nof mischief. Add to these the fluid vigour of the unfinished relief\\nof the Martyrdom of S. Andrew, No. 126, and you have five examples of\\nhuman accomplishment that would be enough without the other Florentine\\nevidences at all -- the Medici chapel tombs and the Duomo Pieta.\\n\\nThe inscription under the Brutus says: \\\"While the sculptor was carving\\nthe statue of Brutus in marble, he thought of the crime and held\\nhis hand\\\"; and the theory is that Michelangelo was at work upon this\\nhead at Rome when, in 1537, Lorenzino de' Medici, who claimed to be\\na modern Brutus, murdered Alessandro de' Medici. But it might easily\\nhave been that the sculptor was concerned only with Brutus the friend\\nof C\\u00e6sar and revolted at his crime. The circumstance that the head\\nis unfinished matters nothing. Once seen it can never be forgotten.\\n\\nAlthough Michelangelo is, as always, the dominator, this room has\\nother possessions to make it a resort of visitors. At the end is a\\nfireplace from the Casa Borgherini, by Benedetto da Rovezzano, which\\nprobably has not an equal, although the pietra serena of which it is\\nmade is a horrid hue; and on the walls are fragments of the tomb of\\nS. Giovanni Gualberto at Vallombrosa, designed by the same artist but\\nnever finished. Benedetto (1474-1556) has a peculiar interest to the\\nEnglish in having come to England in 1524 at the bidding of Cardinal\\nWolsey to design a tomb for that proud prelate. On Wolsey's disgrace,\\nHenry VIII decided that the tomb should be continued for his own bones;\\nbut the sculptor died first and it was unfinished. Later Charles I cast\\nenvious eyes upon it and wished to lie within it; but circumstances\\ndeprived him too of the honour. Finally, after having been despoiled\\nof certain bronze additions, the sarcophagus was used for the remains\\nof Nelson, which it now holds, in St. Paul's crypt. The Borgherini\\nfireplace is a miracle of exquisite work, everything having received\\nthought, the delicate traceries on the pillars not less than the\\nfrieze. The fireplace is in perfect condition, not one head having\\nbeen knocked off, but the Gualberto reliefs are badly damaged, yet\\nfull of life. The angel under the saint's bier in No. 104 almost moves.\\n\\nIn this room look also at the beautiful blades of barley on the\\npillars in the corner close to Brutus, and the lovely frieze by an\\nunknown hand above Michelangelo's Martyrdom of S. Andrew, and the\\ncarving upon the two niches for statues on either side of the door.\\n\\nThe little room through which one passes to the Michelangelos may\\nwell be lingered in. There is a gravely fine floor-tomb of a nun\\nto the left of the door -- No. 20 -- which one would like to see in its\\nproper position instead of upright against the wall; and a stone font\\nin the middle which is very fine. There is also a beautiful tomb by\\nGiusti da Settignano, and the iron gates are worth attention.\\n\\nFrom Michelangelo let us ascend the stairs, past the splendid gates,\\nto Donatello; and here a word about that sculptor, for though we\\nmeet him again and again in Florence (yet never often enough) it is\\nin the upper room in the Bargello that he is enthroned. Of Donatello\\nthere is nothing known but good, and good of the most captivating\\nvariety. Not only was he a great creative genius, equally the first\\nmodern sculptor and the sanest, but he was himself tall and comely,\\nopen-handed, a warm friend, humorous and of vigorous intellect. A\\nhint of the affection in which he was held is obtained from his name\\nDonatello, which is a pet diminutive of Donato -- his full style being\\nDonato di Niccol\\u00f2 di Betto Bardi. Born in 1386, four years before\\nFra Angelico and nearly a century after Giotto, he was the son of a\\nwell-to-do wool-comber who was no stranger to the perils of political\\nenergy in these times. Of Donatello's youth little is known, but it is\\nalmost certain that he helped Ghiberti with his first Baptistery doors,\\nbeing thirteen when that sculptor began upon them. At sixteen he was\\nhimself enrolled as a sculptor. It was soon after this that, as I have\\nsaid in the first chapter, he accompanied his friend Brunelleschi,\\nwho was thirteen years his senior, to Rome; and returning alone he\\nbegan work in Florence in earnest, both for the cathedral and campanile\\nand for Or San Michele. In 1425 he took into partnership Michelozzo,\\nand became, with him, a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of Cosimo de' Medici, with whom both\\ncontinued on friendly terms for the rest of their lives. In 1433 he\\nwas in Rome again, probably not sorry to be there since Cosimo had\\nbeen banished and had taken Michelozzo with him. On the triumphant\\nreturn of Cosimo in 1434 Donatello's most prosperous period began;\\nfor he was intimate with the most powerful man in Florence, was\\nhonoured by him, and was himself at the useful age of forty-four.\\n\\nOf Donatello as an innovator I have said something above, in\\nconsidering the Florentine Davids, but he was also the inventor of\\nthat low relief in which his school worked, called rilievo stiacciato,\\nof which there are some excellent examples at South Kensington. In\\nGhiberti's high relief, breaking out often into completely detached\\nfigures, he was also a master, as we shall see at S. Lorenzo. But his\\ngreatest claim to distinction is his psychological insight allied\\nto perfect mastery of form. His statues were not only the first\\nreally great statues since the Greeks, but are still (always leaving\\nMichelangelo on one side as abnormal) the greatest modern examples\\njudged upon a realistic basis. Here in the Bargello, in originals and\\nin casts, he may be adequately appreciated; but to Padua his admirers\\nmust certainly go, for the bronze equestrian statue of Gattamelata is\\nthere. Donatello was painted by his friend Masaccio at the Carmine,\\nbut the fresco has perished. He is to be seen in the Uffizi portico,\\nalthough that is probably a fancy representation; and again on a tablet\\nin the wall opposite the apse of the Duomo. The only contemporary\\nportrait (and this is very doubtful) is in a picture in the Louvre\\ngiven to Uccello -- a serious, thoughtful, bearded face with steady,\\nobservant eyes: one of five heads, the others being Giotto, Manetti,\\nBrunelleschi, and Uccello himself.\\n\\nDonatello, who never married, but lived for much of his life with his\\nmother and sister, died at a great age, cared for both by Cosimo de'\\nMedici and his son and successor Piero. He was buried with Cosimo\\nin S. Lorenzo. Vasari tells us that he was free, affectionate, and\\ncourteous, but of a high spirit and capable of sudden anger, as when\\nhe destroyed with a blow a head he had made for a mean patron who\\nobjected to its very reasonable price. \\\"He thought,\\\" says Vasari,\\n\\\"nothing of money, keeping it in a basket suspended from the ceiling,\\nso that all his workmen and friends took what they wanted without\\nsaying anything.\\\" He was as careless of dress as great artists have\\never been, and of a handsome robe which Cosimo gave him he complained\\nthat it spoiled his work. When he was dying his relations affected\\ngreat concern in the hope of inheriting a farm at Prato, but he told\\nthem that he had left it to the peasant who had always toiled there,\\nand he would not alter his will.\\n\\nThe Donatello collection in the Bargello has been made representative\\nby the addition of casts. The originals number ten: there is also\\na cast of the equestrian statue of Gattemalata at Padua, which is,\\nI suppose, next to Verrocchio's Bartolommeo Colleoni at Venice, the\\nfinest equestrian statue that exists; heads from various collections,\\nincluding M. Dreyfus' in Paris, although Dr. Bode now gives that\\ncharming example to Donatello's pupil Desiderio; and various\\nother masterpieces elsewhere. But it is the originals that chiefly\\ninterest us, and first of these in bronze is the David, of which I\\nhave already spoken, and first of these in marble the S. George. This\\nGeorge is just such a resolute, clean, warlike idealist as one dreams\\nhim. He would kill a dragon, it is true; but he would eat and sleep\\nafter it and tell the story modestly and not without humour. By a\\nhappy chance the marble upon which Donatello worked had light veins\\nrunning through it just where the head is, with the result that the\\nface seems to possess a radiance of its own. This statue was made for\\nOr San Michele, where it used to stand until 1891, when the present\\nbronze replica that takes its place was made. The spirited marble\\nfrieze underneath it at Or San Michele is the original and has been\\nthere for centuries. It was this S. George whom Ruskin took as the\\nhead and inspiration of his Saint George's Guild.\\n\\nThe David is interesting not only in itself but as being the first\\nisolated statue of modern times. It was made for Cosimo de' Medici,\\nto stand in the courtyard of the Medici palace (now the Riccardi),\\nand until that time, since antiquity, no one had made a statue to\\nstand on a pedestal and be observable from all points. Hitherto modern\\nsculptors had either made reliefs or statues for niches. It was also\\nthe first nude statue of modern times; and once again one has the\\nsatisfaction of recognizing that the first was the best. At any rate,\\nno later sculptor has made anything more charming than this figure,\\nor more masterly within its limits.\\n\\nAfter the S. George and the bronze David, the two most memorable things\\nare the adorable bronze Amorino in its quaint little trousers -- or\\nperhaps not Amorino at all, since it is trampling on a snake,\\nwhich such little sprites did not do -- and the coloured terra-cotta\\nbust called Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano, so like life as to be after a while\\ndisconcerting. The sensitiveness of the mouth can never have been\\nexcelled. The other originals include the gaunt John the Baptist with\\nits curious little moustache, so far removed from the Amorino and so\\nadmirable a proof of the sculptor's vigilant thoughtfulness in all\\nhe did; the relief of the infant John, one of the most animated of\\nthe heads (the Baptist at all periods of his life being a favourite\\nwith this sculptor); three bronze heads, of which those of the Young\\nGentleman and the Roman Emperor remain most clearly in my mind. But\\nthe authorship of the Roman Emperor is very doubtful. And lastly the\\nglorious Marzocco -- the lion from the front of the Palazzo Vecchio,\\nfirmly holding the Florentine escutcheon against the world. Florence\\nhas other Donatellos -- the Judith in the Loggia de' Lanzi, the figures\\non Giotto's campanile, the Annunciation in S. Croce, and above all\\nthe cantoria in the Museum of the Cathedral; but this room holds most\\nof his strong sweet genius. Here (for there are seldom more than two\\nor three persons in it) you can be on terms with him.\\n\\nAfter the Donatellos we should see the other Renaissance sculpture. But\\nfirst the Carrand collection of ivories, pictures, jewels, carvings,\\nvestments, plaquettes, and objets d'art, bequeathed to Florence\\nin 1888. Everything here is good and worth examination. Among the\\noutstanding things is a plaquette, No. 393, a Satyr and a Bacchante,\\nattributed to Donatello, under the title \\\"Allegory of Spring,\\\" which\\nis the work of a master and a very riot of mythological imagery. The\\nneighbouring plaquettes, many of them of the school of Donatello,\\nare all beautiful.\\n\\nWe now find the sixth salon, to see Verrocchio's David, of which I have\\nalready spoken. This wholly charming boy, a little nearer life perhaps\\nthan Donatello's, although not quite so radiantly distinguished,\\nillustrates the association of Verrocchio and Leonardo as clearly\\nas any of the paintings do; for the head is sheer Leonardo. At the\\nPalazzo Vecchio we saw Verrocchio's boy with the dolphin -- that happy\\nbronze lyric -- and outside Or San Michele his Christ and S. Thomas, in\\nDonatello and Michelozzo's niche, with the flying cherubim beneath. But\\nas with Donatello, so with Verrocchio, one must visit the Bargello\\nto see him, in Florence, most intimately. For here are not only his\\nDavid, which once known can never be forgotten and is as full of the\\nRenaissance spirit as anything ever fashioned, whether in bronze,\\nmarble, or paint, but -- upstairs -- certain other wonderfully beautiful\\nthings to which we shall come, and, that being so, I would like here\\nto say a little about their author.\\n\\nVerrocchio is a nickname, signifying the true eye. Andrea's real name\\nwas de' Cioni; he is known to fame as Andrea of the true eye, and since\\nhe had acquired this style at a time when every eye was true enough,\\nhis must have been true indeed. It is probable that he was a pupil\\nof Donatello, who in 1435, when Andrea was born, was forty-nine, and\\nin time he was to become the master of Leonardo: thus are the great\\nartists related. The history of Florentine art is practically the\\nhistory of a family; one artist leads to the other -- the genealogy\\nof genius. The story goes that it was the excellence of the angel\\ncontributed by Leonardo to his master's picture of the Baptism of\\nChrist (at the Accademia) which decided Verrocchio to paint no more,\\njust as Ghiberti's superiority in the relief of Abraham and Isaac\\ndrove Brunelleschi from sculpture. If this be so, it accounts for the\\nextraordinarily small number of pictures by him. Like many artists\\nof his day Verrocchio was also a goldsmith, but he was versatile\\nabove most, even when versatility was a habit, and excelled also as\\na musician. Both Piero de' Medici and Lorenzo employed him to design\\ntheir tournament costumes; and it was for Lorenzo that he made this\\ncharming David and the boy and the dolphin. His greatest work of all\\nis the bronze equestrian statue of Bartolommeo Colleoni in Venice, the\\nfinest thing of its kind in the world, and so glorious and exciting\\nindeed that every city should have a cast of it in a conspicuous\\nposition just for the good of the people. It was while at work upon\\nthis that Verrocchio died, at the age of fifty-three. His body was\\nbrought from Venice by his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who adored him,\\nand was buried in S. Ambrogio in Florence. Lorenzo di Credi painted his\\nportrait, which is now in the Uffizi -- a plump, undistinguished-looking\\nlittle man.\\n\\nIn the David room are also the extremely interesting rival bronze\\nreliefs of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, which were made by Ghiberti and\\nBrunelleschi as trials of skill to see which would win the commission\\nto design the new gates of the Baptistery, as I have told earlier in\\nthis book. Six competitors entered for the contest; but Ghiberti's and\\nBrunelleschi's efforts were alone considered seriously. A comparison\\nof these two reliefs proves that Ghiberti, at any rate, had a finer\\nsense of grouping. He filled the space at his disposal more easily\\nand his hand was more fluent; but there is a very engaging vivacity\\nin the other work, the realistic details of which are so arresting\\nas to make one regret that Brunelleschi had for sculpture so little\\ntime. In S. Maria Novella is that crucifix in wood which he carved for\\nhis friend Donatello, but his only other sculptured work in Florence is\\nthe door of his beautiful Pazzi chapel in the cloisters of S. Croce. Of\\nGhiberti's Baptistery gates I have said more elsewhere. Enough here\\nto add that the episode of Abraham and Isaac does not occur in them.\\n\\nThis little room also has a Cassa Reliquiaria by Ghiberti, below a fine\\nrelief by Bertoldo, Michelangelo's master in sculpture, representing\\na battle between the Romans and the Barbarians; cases of exquisite\\nbronzes; the head, in bronze (No. 25), of an old placid, shrewd woman,\\nexecuted from a death-mask, which the photographers call Contessina\\nde' Bardi, wife of Cosimo de' Medici, by Donatello, but which cannot\\nbe so, since the sculptor died first; heads of Apollo and two babies,\\nover the Ghiberti and Brunelleschi competition reliefs; a crucifixion\\nby Bertoldo; a row of babies representing the triumph of Bacchus; and\\nbelow these a case of medals and plaquettes, every one a masterpiece.\\n\\nThe next room, Sala VII, is apportioned chiefly between Cellini\\nand Gian or Giovanni da Bologna, the two sculptors who dominate the\\nLoggia de' Lanzi. Here we may see models for Cellini's Perseus in\\nbronze and wax and also for the relief of the rescue of Andromeda,\\nunder the statue; his Cosimo I, with the wart (omitted by Bandinelli\\nin the head downstairs, which pairs with Michelangelo's Brutus);\\nand various smaller works. But personally I find that Cellini will\\nnot do in such near proximity to Donatello, Verrocchio, and their\\ngentle followers. He was, of course, far later. He was not born (in\\n1500) until Donatello had been dead thirty-four years, Mino da Fiesole\\nsixteen years, Desiderio da Settignano thirty-six years, and Verrocchio\\ntwelve years. He thus did not begin to work until the finer impulses\\nof the Renaissance were exhausted. Giovanni da Bologna, although he,\\nit is true, was even later (1524-1608), I find more sympathetic; while\\nLandor boldly proclaimed him superior to Michelangelo. His \\\"Mercury,\\\"\\nin the middle of the room, which one sees counterfeited in all the\\nstatuary shops of Florence, is truly very nearly light as air. If ever\\nbronze floated, this figure does. His cherubs and dolphins are very\\nskilful and merry; his turkey and eagle and other animals indicate\\nthat he had humility. John of Bologna is best known at Florence by\\nhis Rape of the Sabines and Hercules and Nessus in the Loggia de'\\nLanzi; but the Boboli gardens have a fine group of Oceanus and river\\ngods by him in the midst of a lake. Before leaving this room look at\\nthe relief of Christ in glory (No. 35), to the left of the door, by\\nJacopo Sansovino, a rival of Michelangelo, which is most admirable,\\nand at the case of bronze animals by Pietro Tacca, John of Bologna's\\npupil, who made the famous boar (a copy of an ancient marble) at\\nthe Mercato Nuovo and the reliefs for the pediment of the statue of\\nCosimo I (by his master) in the Piazza della Signoria. But I believe\\nthat the most beautiful thing in this room is the bronze figure for\\nthe tomb of Mariano Sozzino by Lorenzo di Pietro.\\n\\nBefore we look at the della Robbias, which are in the two large rooms\\nupstairs, let us finish with the marble and terra-cotta statuary in\\nthe two smaller rooms to the left as one passes through the first\\ndella Robbia room. In the first of them, corresponding to the room\\nwith Verrocchio's David downstairs, we find Verrocchio again, with\\na bust of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici (whom Botticelli painted in\\nthe Uffizi holding a medal in his hand) and a most exquisite Madonna\\nand Child in terra-cotta from S. Maria Nuova. (This is on a hinge,\\nfor better light, but the official skies will fall if you touch\\nit.) Here also is the bust of a young warrior by Antonio Pollaiuolo\\n(1429-1498) who was Verrocchio's closest rival and one of Ghiberti's\\nassistants for the second Baptistery doors. His greatest work is at\\nRome, but this bust is indescribably charming, and the softness of the\\nboy's contours is almost of life. It is sometimes called Giuliano de'\\nMedici. Other beautiful objects in the room are the terra-cotta Madonna\\nand Child by Andrea Sansovino (1460-1529), Pollaiuolo's pupil, which\\nis as radiant although not so domestically lovely as Verrocchio's;\\nthe bust by Benedetto da Maiano (1442-1497) of Pietro Mellini, that\\nshrewd and wrinkled patron of the Church who presented to S. Croce\\nthe famous pulpit by this sculptor; an ancient lady, by the door,\\nin coloured terra-cotta, who is thought to represent Monna Tessa, the\\nnurse of Dante's Beatrice; and certain other works by that delightful\\nand prolific person Ignoto Fiorentino, who here, and in the next room,\\nwhich we now enter, is at his best.\\n\\nThis next priceless room is chiefly memorable for Verrocchio and\\nMino da Fiesole. We come to Verrocchio at once, on the left, where\\nhis relief of the death of Francesca Pitti Tornabuoni (on a tiny\\nbed only half as long as herself) may be seen. This poor lady, who\\ndied in childbirth, was the wife of Giovanni Tornabuoni, and he it\\nwas who employed Ghirlandaio to make the frescoes in the choir of\\nS. Maria Novella. (I ought, however, to state that Miss Cruttwell,\\nin her monograph on Verrocchio, questions both the subject and the\\nartist.) Close by we have two more works by Verrocchio -- No. 180, a\\nmarble relief of the Madonna and Child, the Madonna's dress fastened\\nby the prettiest of brooches, and She herself possessing a dainty sad\\nhead and the long fingers that Verrocchio so favoured, which we find\\nagain in the famous \\\"Gentildonna\\\" (No. 181) next it -- that Florentine\\nlady with flowers in her bosom, whose contours are so exquisite and\\nwho has such pretty shoulders.\\n\\nNear by is the little eager S. John the Baptist as a boy by Antonio\\nRossellino (1427-1478), and on the next wall the same sculptor's\\ncircular relief of the Madonna adoring, in a border of cherubs.\\nIn the middle is the masterpiece of Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570): a\\nBacchus, so strangely like a genuine antique, full of Greek lightness\\nand grace. And then we come back to the wall in which the door is,\\nand find more works from the delicate hand of Mino da Fiesole, whom\\nwe in London are fortunate in being able to study as near home as at\\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum. Of Mino I have said more both at the\\nBadia and at Fiesole. But here I might remark again that he was born\\nin 1431 and died in 1484, and was the favourite pupil of Desiderio\\nda Settignano, who was in his turn the favourite pupil of Donatello.\\n\\nIn the little church of S. Ambrogio we have seen a tablet to the\\nmemory of Mino, who lies there, not far from the grave of Verrocchio,\\nwhom he most nearly approached in feeling, although their ideal type of\\nwoman differed in everything save the slenderness of the fingers. The\\nBargello has both busts and reliefs by him, all distinguished and\\nsensitive and marked by Mino's profound refinement. The Madonna and\\nChild in No. 232 are peculiarly beautiful and notable both for high\\nrelief and shallow relief, and the Child in No. 193 is even more\\ncharming. For delicacy and vivacity in marble portraiture it would\\nbe impossible to surpass the head of Rinaldo della Luna; and the two\\nMedicis are wonderfully real. Everything in Mino's work is thoughtful\\nand exquisite, while the unusual type of face which so attracted him\\ngives him freshness too.\\n\\nThis room and that next it illustrate the wealth of fine sculptors\\nwhich Florence had in the fifteenth century, for the works by the\\nunknown hands are in some cases hardly less beautiful and masterly than\\nthose by the known. Look, for example, at the fleur-de-lis over the\\ndoor; at the Madonna and Child next it, on the right; at the girl's\\nhead next to that; at the baby girl at the other end of the room;\\nand at the older boy and his pendant. But one does not need to come\\nhere to form an idea of the wealth of good sculpture. The streets\\nalone are full of it. Every palace has beautiful stone-work and an\\nescutcheon which often only a master could execute -- as Donatello\\ndevised that for the Palazzo Pazzi in the Borgo degli Albizzi. On the\\ngreat staircase of the Bargello, for example, are numbers of coats\\nof arms that could not be more beautifully designed and incised.\\n\\nIn the room leading from that which is memorable for Pollaiuolo's\\nyouth in armour is a collection of medals by all the best medallists,\\nbeginning, in the first case, with Pisanello. Here are his Sigismondo\\nMalatesta, the tyrant of Rimini, and Isotta his wife; here also is\\na portrait of Leon Battista Alberti, who designed and worked on the\\ncathedral of Rimini as well as upon S. Maria Novella in Florence. On\\nthe other side of this case is the medal commemorating the Pazzi\\nconspiracy. In other cases are pretty Italian ladies, such as Julia\\nAstalla, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, with her hair in curls just as in\\nGhirlandaio's frescoes, Costanza Rucellai, Leonora Altoviti, Maria\\nPoliziano, and Maria de' Mucini.\\n\\nAnd so we come to the della Robbias, without whose joyous, radiant\\nart Florence would be only half as beautiful as she is. Of these\\nexquisite artists Luca, the uncle, born in 1400, was by far the\\ngreatest. Andrea, his nephew, born in 1435, came next, and then\\nGiovanni. Luca seems to have been a serious, quiet man who would\\nprobably have made sculpture not much below his friend Donatello's had\\nnot he chanced on the discovery of a means of colouring and glazing\\nterra-cotta. Examples of this craft are seen all over Florence both\\nwithin doors and out, as the pages of this book indicate, but at the\\nBargello is the greatest number of small pieces gathered together. I\\ndo not say there is anything here more notable than the Annunciation\\nattributed to Andrea at the Spedale degli Innocenti, while of course,\\nfor most people, his putti on the fa\\u00e7ade of that building are the\\ndella Robbia symbol; nor is there anything finer than Luca's work\\nat Impruneta; but as a collection of sweetness and gentle domestic\\nbeauty these Bargello reliefs are unequalled, both in character and in\\nvolume. Here you see what one might call Roman Catholic art -- that is,\\nthe art which at once gives pleasure to simple souls and symbolizes\\nbenevolence and safety -- carried out to its highest power. Tenderness,\\nhappiness, and purity are equally suggested by every relief here. Had\\nLuca and Andrea been entrusted with the creation of the world it\\nwould be a paradise. And, as it is, it seems to me impossible but\\nthat they left the world sweeter than they found it. Such examples\\nof affection and solicitude as they were continually bringing to the\\npopular vision must have engendered kindness.\\n\\nI have noted as especially beautiful in the first room Nos. 4,\\n6, 12, 23, by Andrea; and 10 and 21, by Luca. These, by the\\nway, are the Bargello ascriptions, but the experts do not always\\nagree. Herr Bode, for example, who has studied the della Robbias with\\npassionate thoroughness, gives the famous head of the boy, which is\\nin reproduction one of the best-known works of plastic art, to Luca;\\nbut the Bargello director says Andrea. In Herr Bode's fascinating\\nmonograph, \\\"Florentine Sculptors of the Renaissance,\\\" he goes very\\ncarefully into the differences between the uncle and the nephew,\\nmaster and pupil. In all the groups, for example, he says that Luca\\nplaces the Child on the Madonna's left arm, Andrea on the right. In\\nthe second room I have marked particularly Nos. 21, 28, and 31,\\nby Luca, 28 being a deeper relief than usual, and the Madonna not\\nadoring but holding and delighting in one of the most adorable of\\nBabies. Observe in the reproduction of this relief in this volume -- \\nhow the Mother's fingers sink into the child's flesh. Luca was the\\nfirst sculptor to notice that. No. 31 is the lovely Madonna of the\\nRose Bower. But nothing gives me more pleasure than the boy's head of\\nwhich I have just spoken, attributed to Andrea and also reproduced\\nhere. The \\\"Giovane Donna\\\" which pairs with it has extraordinary\\ncharm and delicacy too. I have marked also, by Andrea, Nos. 71 and\\n76. Giovanni della Robbia's best is perhaps No. 15, in the other room.\\n\\nOne curious thing that one notes about della Robbia pottery is its\\ninability to travel. It was made for the church and it should remain\\nthere. Even in the Bargello, where there is an ancient environment,\\nit loses half its charm; while in an English museum it becomes hard\\nand cold. But in a church to which the poor carry their troubles,\\nwith a dim light and a little incense, it is perfect, far beyond\\npainting in its tenderness and symbolic value. I speak of course\\nof the Madonnas and altar-pieces. When the della Robbias worked for\\nthe open air -- as in the fa\\u00e7ade of the Children's Hospital, or at the\\nCertosa, or in the Loggia di San Paolo, opposite S. Maria Novella,\\nwhere one may see the beautiful meeting of S. Francis and S. Dominic,\\nby Andrea -- they seem, in Italy, to have fitness enough; but it would\\nnot do to transplant any of these reliefs to an English fa\\u00e7ade. There\\nwas once, I might add, in Florence a Via della Robbia, but it is now\\nthe Via Nazionale. I suppose this injustice to the great potters came\\nabout in the eighteen-sixties, when popular political enthusiasm led\\nto every kind of similar re-naming.\\n\\nIn the room leading out of the second della Robbia room is a collection\\nof vestments and brocades bequeathed by Baron Giulio Franchetti, where\\nyou may see, dating from as far back as the sixth century, designs\\nthat for beauty and splendour and durability put to shame most of the\\nstuffs now woven; but the top floor of the Museo Archeologico in the\\nVia della Colonna is the chief home in Florence of such treasures.\\n\\nThere are other beautiful things in the Bargello of which I have said\\nnothing -- a gallery of mediaeval bells most exquisitely designed, from\\nfamous steeples; cases of carved ivory; and many of such treasures as\\none sees at the Cluny in Paris. But it is for its courtyard and for the\\nRenaissance sculpture that one goes to the Bargello, and returns again\\nand again to the Bargello, and it is for these that one remembers it.\\n\\nOn returning to London the first duty of every one who has drunk\\ndeep of delight in the Bargello is to visit that too much neglected\\ntreasure-house of our own, the Victoria and Albert Museum at South\\nKensington. There may be nothing at South Kensington as fine as the\\nBargello's finest, but it is a priceless collection and is superior\\nto the Bargello in one respect at any rate, for it has a relief\\nattributed to Leonardo. Here also is an adorable Madonna and laughing\\nChild, beyond anything in Florence for sheer gaiety if not mischief,\\nwhich the South Kensington authorities call a Rossellino but Herr\\nBode a Desiderio da Settignano. The room is rich too in Donatello\\nand in Verrocchio, and altogether it makes a perfect footnote to the\\nBargello. It also has within call learned gentlemen who can give\\nintimate information about the exhibits, which the Bargello badly\\nlacks. The Louvre and the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin -- but\\nparticularly the Kaiser Friedrich since Herr Bode, who has such\\na passion for this period, became its director -- have priceless\\ntreasures, and in Paris I have had the privilege of seeing the little\\nbut exquisite collection formed by M. Gustave Dreyfus, dominated by\\nthat mirthful Italian child which the Bargello authorities consider to\\nbe by Donatello, but Herr Bode gives to Desiderio. At the Louvre, in\\ngalleries on the ground floor gained through the Egyptian sculpture\\nsection and opened very capriciously, may be seen the finest of\\nthe prisoners from Michelangelo's tomb for Pope Julius; Donatello's\\nyouthful Baptist; a Madonna and Children by Agostino di Duccio, whom\\nwe saw at the Museum of the Cathedral; an early coloured terra-cotta\\nby Luca della Robbia, and No. 316, a terra-cotta Madonna and Child\\nwithout ascription, which looks very like Rossellino.\\n\\nIn addition to originals there are at South Kensington casts of many\\nof the Bargello's most valuable possessions, such as Donatello's\\nand Verrocchio's Davids, Donatello's Baptist and many heads, Mino\\nda Fiesole's best Madonna, Pollaiuolo's Young Warrior, and so forth;\\nso that to loiter there is most attractively to recapture something\\nof the Florentine feeling.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nS. Croce\\n\\nAn historic piazza -- Marble fa\\u00e7ades -- Florence's Westminster\\nAbbey -- Galileo's ancestor and Ruskin -- Benedetto's\\npulpit -- Michelangelo's tomb -- A fond lady -- Donatello's\\nAnnunciation -- Giotto's frescoes -- S. Francis -- Donatello magnanimous -- The\\ngifted Alberti -- Desiderio's great tomb -- The sacristy -- The Medici\\nchapel -- The Pazzi chapel -- Old Jacopo desecrated -- A Restoration.\\n\\nThe piazza S. Croce now belongs to children. The church is at one\\nend, bizarre buildings are on either side, the Dante statue is in the\\nmiddle, and harsh gravel covers the ground. Everywhere are children,\\nall dirty, and all rather squalid and mostly bow-legged, showing that\\nthey were of the wrong age to take their first steps on Holy Saturday\\nat noon. The long brown building on the right, as we face S. Croce,\\nis a seventeenth-century palazzo. For the rest, the architecture is\\nchiefly notable for green shutters.\\n\\nThe frigid and florid Dante memorial, which was unveiled in 1865 on\\nthe six hundredth anniversary of the poet's birthday, looks gloomily\\nupon what once was a scene of splendour and animation, for in 1469\\nPiero de' Medici devised here a tournament in honour of the betrothal\\nof Lorenzo to Clarice Orsini. The Queen of the tournament was Lucrezia\\nDonati, and she awarded the first prize to Lorenzo. The tournament cost\\n10,000 gold florins and was very splendid, Verrocchio and other artists\\nbeing called in to design costumes, and it is thought that Pollaiuolo's\\nterra-cotta of the Young Warrior in the Bargello represents the comely\\nGiuliano de' Medici as he appeared in his armour in the lists. The\\npiazza was the scene also of that famous tournament given by Lorenzo\\nde' Medici for Giuliano in 1474, of which the beautiful Simonetta\\nwas the Queen of Beauty, and to which, as I have said elsewhere, we\\nowe Botticelli's two most famous pictures. Difficult to reconstruct\\nin the Piazza any of those glories to-day.\\n\\nThe new fa\\u00e7ade of S. Croce, endowed not long since by an Englishman,\\nhas been much abused, but it is not so bad. As the front of so\\nbeautiful and wonderful a church it may be inadequate, but as a\\nstructure of black and white marble it will do. To my mind nothing\\nsatisfactory can now be done in this medium, which, unless it is\\ncenturies old, is always harsh and cuts the sky like a knife, instead\\nof resting against it as architecture should. But when it is old,\\nas at S. Miniato, it is right.\\n\\nS. Croce is the Westminster Abbey of Florence. Michelangelo lies here,\\nMachiavelli lies here, Galileo lies here; and here Giotto painted,\\nDonatello carved, and Brunelleschi planned. Although outside the church\\nis disappointing, within it is the most beautiful in Florence. It\\nhas the boldest arches, the best light at all seasons, the most\\nattractive floor -- of gentle red -- and an apse almost wholly made of\\ncoloured glass. Not a little of its charm comes from the delicate\\npassage-way that runs the whole course of the church high up on the\\nyellow walls. It also has the finest circular window in Florence,\\nover the main entrance, a \\\"Deposition\\\" by Ghiberti.\\n\\nThe lightness was indeed once so intense that no fewer than twenty-two\\nwindows had to be closed. The circular window over the altar upon which\\na new roof seems to be intruding is in reality the interloper: the roof\\nis the original one, and the window was cut later, in defiance of good\\narchitecture, by Vasari, who, since he was a pupil of Michelangelo,\\nshould have known better. To him was entrusted the restoration of\\nthe church in the middle of the sixteenth century.\\n\\nThe original architect of the modern S. Croce was the same Arnolfo di\\nCambio, or Lapo, who began the Duomo. He had some right to be chosen\\nsince his father, Jacopo, or Lapo, a German, was the builder of the\\nmost famous of all the Franciscan churches -- that at Assisi, which was\\nbegun while S. Francis was still living. And Giotto, who painted in\\nthat church his most famous frescoes, depicting scenes in the life\\nof S. Francis, succeeded Arnolfo here, as at the Duomo, with equal\\nfitness. Arnolfo began S. Croce in 1294, the year that the building of\\nthe Duomo was decided upon, as a reply to the new Dominican Church of\\nS. Maria Novella, and to his German origin is probably due the Northern\\nimpression which the interiors both of S. Croce and the Duomo convey.\\n\\nThe first thing to examine in S. Croce is the floor-tomb, close to the\\ncentre door, upon which Ruskin wrote one of his most characteristic\\npassages. The tomb is of an ancestor of Galileo (who lies close\\nby, but beneath a florid monument), and it represents a mediaeval\\nscholarly figure with folded hands. Ruskin writes: \\\"That worn face is\\nstill a perfect portrait of the old man, though like one struck out\\nat a venture, with a few rough touches of a master's chisel. And that\\nfalling drapery of his cap is, in its few lines, faultless, and subtle\\nbeyond description. And now, here is a simple but most useful test of\\nyour capacity for understanding Florentine sculpture or painting. If\\nyou can see that the lines of that cap are both right, and lovely; that\\nthe choice of the folds is exquisite in its ornamental relations of\\nline; and that the softness and ease of them is complete, -- though only\\nsketched with a few dark touches, -- then you can understand Giotto's\\ndrawing, and Botticelli's; Donatello's carving and Luca's. But if\\nyou see nothing in this sculpture, you will see nothing in theirs,\\nof theirs. Where they choose to imitate flesh, or silk, or to play any\\nvulgar modern trick with marble -- (and they often do) -- whatever, in a\\nword, is French, or American, or Cockney, in their work, you can see;\\nbut what is Florentine, and for ever great -- unless you can see also\\nthe beauty of this old man in his citizen's cap, -- you will see never.\\\"\\n\\nThe passage is in \\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" which begins with S. Croce\\nand should be read by every one visiting the city. And here let me\\nadvise another companion for this church: a little dark enthusiast, in\\na black skull cap, named Alfred Branconi, who is usually to be found\\njust inside the doors, but may be secured as a guide by a postcard\\nto the church. Signor Branconi knows S. Croce and he loves it, and\\nhe has the further qualifications of knowing all Florence too and\\nspeaking excellent English, which he taught himself.\\n\\nThe S. Croce pulpit, which is by Benedetto da Maiano, is a satisfying\\nthing, accomplished both in proportions and workmanship, with panels\\nillustrating scenes in the life of S. Francis. These are all most\\ngently and persuasively done, influenced, of course, by the Baptistery\\ndoors, but individual too, and full of a kindred sweetness and\\nliveliness. The scenes are the \\\"Confirmation of the Franciscan Order\\\"\\n(the best, I think); the \\\"Burning of the Books\\\"; the \\\"Stigmata,\\\"\\nwhich we shall see again in the church, in fresco, for here we are\\nall dedicated to the saint of Assisi, not yet having come upon the\\nstern S. Dominic, the ruler at S. Marco and S. Maria Novella; the\\n\\\"Death of S. Francis,\\\" very real and touching, which we shall also\\nsee again; and the execution of certain Franciscans. Benedetto,\\nwho was also an architect and made the plan of the Strozzi palace,\\nwas so unwilling that anything should mar the scheme of his pulpit,\\nthat after strengthening this pillar with the greatest care and\\nthoroughness, he hollowed it and placed the stairs inside.\\n\\nThe first tomb on the right, close to this pulpit, is Michelangelo's,\\na mass of allegory, designed by his friend Vasari, the author of the\\n\\\"Lives of the Artists,\\\" the reading of which is perhaps the best\\npreparation for the understanding of Florence. \\\"If life pleases us,\\\"\\nMichelangelo once said, \\\"we ought not to be grieved by death, which\\ncomes from the same Giver.\\\" Michelangelo had intended the Piet\\u00e0, now\\nin the Duomo, to stand above his grave; but Vasari, who had a little\\nof the Pepys in his nature, thought to do him greater honour by this\\nornateness. The artist was laid to his rest in 1564, but not before his\\nbody was exhumed, by his nephew, at Rome, where the great man had died,\\nand a series of elaborate ceremonies had been performed, which Vasari,\\nwho is here trustworthy enough, describes minutely. All the artists\\nin Florence vied in celebrating the dead master in memorial paintings\\nfor his catafalque and its surroundings, which have now perished;\\nbut probably the loss is not great, except as an example of homage,\\nfor that was a bad period. How bad it was may be a little gauged by\\nVasari's tributory tomb and his window over the high altar.\\n\\nOpposite Michelangelo's tomb, on the pillar, is the pretty but rather\\nVictorian \\\"Madonna del Latte,\\\" surrounded by angels, by Bernardo\\nRossellino (1409-1464), brother of the author of the great tomb at\\nS. Miniato. This pretty relief was commissioned as a family memorial\\nby that Francesco Nori, the close friend of Lorenzo de' Medici, who\\nwas killed in the Duomo during the Pazzi conspiracy in his effort to\\nsave Lorenzo from the assassins.\\n\\nThe tomb of Alfieri, the dramatist, to which we now come, was\\nerected at the cost of his mistress, the Countess of Albany,\\nwho herself sat to Canova for the figure of bereaved Italy. This\\ncurious and unfortunate woman became, at the age of nineteen, the\\nwife of the Young Pretender, twenty-seven years after the '45, and\\nled a miserable existence with him (due chiefly to his depravity,\\nbut a little, she always held, to the circumstance that they chose\\nGood Friday for their wedding day) until Alfieri fell in love with\\nher and offered his protection. Together she and the poet remained,\\napparently contented with each other and received by society, even\\nby the English Royal family, until Alfieri died, in 1803, when after\\nexclaiming that she had lost all -- \\\"consolations, support, society,\\nall, all!\\\" -- and establishing this handsome memorial, she selected the\\nFrench artist Fabre to fill the aching void in her fifty-years-old\\nheart; and Fabre not only filled it until her death in 1824, but\\nbecame the heir of all that had been bequeathed to her by both the\\nStuart and Alfieri. Such was the Countess of Albany, to whom human\\naffection was so necessary. She herself is buried close by, in the\\nchapel of the Castellani.\\n\\nMrs. Piozzi, in her \\\"Glimpses of Italian Society,\\\" mentions seeing\\nin Florence in 1785 the unhappy Pretender. Though old and sickly,\\nhe went much into society, sported the English arms and livery,\\nand wore the garter.\\n\\nOther tombs in the right aisle are those of Machiavelli, the\\nstatesman and author of \\\"The Prince,\\\" and Rossini, the composer of\\n\\\"William Tell,\\\" who died in Paris in 1868, but was brought here for\\nburial. These tombs are modern and of no artistic value, but there\\nis near them a fine fifteenth-century example in the monument by\\nBernardo Rossellino to another statesman and author, Leonardo Bruni,\\nknown as Aretino, who wrote the lives of Dante and Petrarch and a\\nLatin history of Florence, a copy of which was placed on his heart at\\nhis funeral. This tomb is considered to be Rossellino's masterpiece;\\nbut there is one opposite by another hand which dwarfs it.\\n\\nThere is also a work of sculpture near it, in the same wall, which\\ndraws away the eyes -- Donatello's \\\"Annunciation\\\". The experts now think\\nthis to belong to the sculptor's middle period, but Vasari thought it\\nearlier, and makes it the work which had most influence in establishing\\nhis reputation; while according to the archives it was placed in the\\nchurch before Donatello was living. Vasari ought to be better informed\\nupon this point than usual, since it was he who was employed in the\\nsixteenth century to renovate S. Croce, at which time the chapel for\\nwhose altar the relief was made -- that of the Cavalcanti family -- was\\nremoved. The relief now stands unrelated to anything. Every detail of\\nit should be examined; but Alfred Branconi will see to that. The stone\\nis the grey pietra serena of Fiesole, and Donatello has plentifully,\\nbut not too plentifully, lightened it with gold, which is exactly what\\nall artists who used this medium for sculpture should have done. By a\\npleasant tactful touch the designer of the modern Donatello monument\\nin S. Lorenzo has followed the master's lead.\\n\\nAlmost everything of Donatello's that one sees is in turn the best; but\\nstanding before this lovely work one is more than commonly conscious\\nof being in the presence of a wonderful creator. The Virgin is wholly\\nunlike any other woman, and She is surprising and modern even for\\nDonatello with his vast range. The charming terra-cotta boys above\\nare almost without doubt from the same hand, but they cannot have\\nbeen made for this monument.\\n\\nTo the della Robbias we come in the Castellani chapel in the right\\ntransept, which has two full-length statues by either Luca or\\nAndrea, in the gentle glazed medium, of S. Francis and S. Bernard,\\nquite different from anything we have seen or shall see, because\\nisolated. The other full-size figures by these masters -- such as\\nthose at Impruneta -- are placed against the wall. The S. Bernard,\\non the left as one enters the chapel, is far the finer. It surely\\nmust be one of the most beautiful male draped figures in the world.\\n\\nThe next chapel, at the end of the transept, was once enriched by\\nGiotto frescoes, but they no longer exist. There are, however, an\\ninteresting but restored series of scenes in the life of the Virgin\\nby Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's godson; a Madonna ascending to heaven,\\nby Mainardi, who was Ghirlandaio's pupil, and so satisfactory a one\\nthat he was rewarded by the hand of his master's sister; and a pretty\\npiece of Gothic sculpture with the Christ Child upon it. Hereabouts,\\nI may remark, we have continually to be walking over floor-tombs,\\nnow ruined beyond hope, their ruin being perhaps the cause of a\\nprotecting rail being placed round the others; although a floor-tomb\\nshould have, I think, a little wearing from the feet of worshippers,\\njust to soften the lines. Those at the Certosa are, for example,\\nfar too sharp and clean.\\n\\nLet us complete the round of the church before we examine the sacristy,\\nand go now to the two chapels, where Giotto may be found at his best,\\nalthough restored too, on this side of the high altar. The Peruzzi\\nchapel has scenes from the lives of the two S. Johns, the Baptist,\\nand the Evangelist: all rather too thoroughly re-painted, although\\nfollowing Giotto's groundwork closely enough to retain much of\\ntheir interest and value. And here once again one should consult the\\n\\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" where the wilful discerning enthusiast is,\\nlike his revered subject, also at his best. Giotto's thoughtfulness\\ncould not be better illustrated than in S. Croce. One sees him, as\\never, thinking of everything: not a very remarkable attribute of the\\nfresco painter since then, but very remarkable then, when any kind of\\nfacile saintliness sufficed. Signor Bianchi, who found these paintings\\nunder the whitewash in 1853, and restored them, overdid his part,\\nthere is no doubt; but as I have said, their interest is unharmed,\\nand it is that which one so delights in. Look, for instance, at the\\nattitude of Drusiana, suddenly twitched by S. John back again into\\nthis vale of tears, while her bier is on its way to the cemetery\\noutside the pretty city. \\\"Am I really to live again?\\\" she so plainly\\nsays to the inexorable miracle-worker. The dancing of Herodias'\\ndaughter, which offered Giotto less scope, is original too -- original\\nnot because it came so early, but because Giotto's mind was original\\nand innovating and creative. The musician is charming. The last scene\\nof all is a delightful blend of religious fervour and reality: the\\nmiraculous ascent from the tomb, through an elegant Florentine loggia,\\nto everlasting glory, in a blaze of gold, and Christ and an apostle\\nleaning out of heaven with outstretched hands to pull the saint in,\\nas into a boat. Such a Christ as that could not but be believed in.\\n\\nIn the next chapel, the Bardi, we find Giotto at work on a life of\\nS. Francis, and here again Ruskin is essential. It was a task which,\\nsince this church was the great effort of the Florentine Franciscans,\\nwould put an artist upon his mettle, and Giotto set the chosen\\nincidents before the observers with the discretion and skill of the\\ngreat biographer that he was, and not only that, but the great Assisi\\ndecorator that he was. No choice could have been better at any time\\nin the history of art. Giotto chose the following scenes, one or two\\nof which coincide with those on Benedetto da Maiano's pulpit, which\\ncame of course many years later: the \\\"Confirmation of the Rules of the\\nFranciscans,\\\" \\\"S. Francis before the Sultan and the Magi,\\\" \\\"S. Francis\\nSick and Appearing to the Bishop of Assisi,\\\" \\\"S. Francis Fleeing from\\nHis Father's House and His Reception by the Bishop of Assisi,\\\" and the\\n\\\"Death of S. Francis\\\". Giotto's Assisi frescoes, which preceded these,\\nanticipate them; but in some cases these are considered to be better,\\nalthough in others not so good. It is generally agreed that the death\\nscene is the best. Note the characteristic touch by which Giotto makes\\none of the monks at the head of the bed look up at the precise moment\\nwhen the saint dies, seeing him being received into heaven. According\\nto Vasari, one of the two monks (on the extreme left, as I suppose)\\nis Giotto's portrait of the architect of the church, Amolfo. The altar\\npicture, consisting of many more scenes in the life of S. Francis,\\nis often attributed to Cimabue, Giotto's master, but probably is by\\nanother hand. In one of these scenes the saint is found preaching\\nto what must be the most attentive birds on record. The figures on\\nthe ceiling represent Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience, which all\\nFranciscans are pledged to observe. The glass is coeval with the\\nbuilding, which has been described as the most perfect Gothic chapel\\nin existence.\\n\\nThe founder of this chapel was Ridolfo de' Bardi, whose family early\\nin the fourteenth century bade fair to become as powerful as the\\nMedici, and by the same means, their business being banking and\\nmoney-lending, in association with the founders of the adjoining\\nchapel, the Peruzzi. Ridolfo's father died in 1310, and his son,\\nwho had become a Franciscan, in 1327; and the chapel was built,\\nand Giotto probably painted the frescoes, soon after the father's\\ndeath. Both the Bardi and Peruzzi were brought low by our King Edward\\nIII, who borrowed from them money with which to fight the French,\\nat Crecy and Poitiers, and omitted to repay it.\\n\\nThe chapels in the left transept are less interesting, except perhaps\\nto students of painting in its early days. In the chapel at the end\\nwe find Donatello's wooden crucifix which led to that friendly rivalry\\non the part of Brunelleschi, the story of which is one of the best in\\nall Vasari. Donatello, having finished this wooden crucifix, and being\\nunusually satisfied with it, asked Brunelleschi's opinion, confidently\\nexpecting praise. But Brunelleschi, who was sufficiently close a friend\\nto say what he thought, replied that the type was too rough and common:\\nit was not Christ but a peasant. Christ, of course, was a peasant;\\nbut by peasant Brunelleschi meant a stupid, dull man. Donatello,\\nchagrined, had recourse to what has always been a popular retort to\\ncritics, and challenged him to make a better. Brunelleschi took it very\\nquietly: he said nothing in reply, but secretly for many months, in\\nthe intervals of his architecture, worked at his own version, and then\\none day, when it was finished, invited Donatello to dinner, stopping\\nat the Mercato Vecchio to get some eggs and other things. These he\\ngave Donatello to carry, and sent him on before him to the studio,\\nwhere the crucifix was standing unveiled. When Brunelleschi arrived he\\nfound the eggs scattered and broken on the floor and Donatello before\\nhis carving in an ecstasy of admiration. \\\"But what are we going to\\nhave for dinner?\\\" the host inquired. \\\"Dinner!\\\" said Donatello; \\\"I've\\nhad all the dinner I require. To thee it is given to carve Christs:\\nto me only peasants.\\\" No one should forget this pretty story, either\\nhere or at S. Maria Novella, where Brunelleschi's crucifix now is.\\n\\nThe flexible Siena iron grille of this end chapel dates from 1335. Note\\nits ivy border.\\n\\nOn entering the left aisle we find the tombs of Cherubini, the\\ncomposer, Raphael Morghen, the engraver, and that curious example of\\nthe Florentine universalist, whose figure we saw under the Uffizi,\\nLeon Battista Alberti (1405-1472), architect, painter, author,\\nmathematician, scholar, conversationalist, aristocrat, and friend of\\nprinces. His chief work in Florence is the Rucellai palace and the\\nfa\\u00e7ade of S. Maria Novella, but he was greater as an influence than\\ncreator, and his manuals on architecture, painting, and the study of\\nperspective helped to bring the arts to perfection. It is at Rimini\\nthat he was perhaps most wonderful. Lorenzo de' Medici greatly valued\\nhis society, and he was a leader in the Platonic Academy. But the most\\nhuman achievement to his credit is his powerful plea for using the\\nvernacular in literature, rather than concealing one's best thoughts,\\nas was fashionable before his protest, in Latin. So much for Alberti's\\nintellectual side. Physically he was remarkable too, and one of his\\naccomplishments was to jump over a man standing upright, while he was\\nalso able to throw a coin on to the highest tower, even, I suppose,\\nthe Campanile, and ride any horse, however wild. At the Bargello may\\nbe seen Alberti's portrait, on a medal designed by Pisanello. The old\\nmedals are indeed the best authority for the lineaments of the great\\nmen of the Renaissance, better far than paint. At South Kensington\\nthousands may be seen, either in the original or in reproduction.\\n\\nIn the right aisle we saw Bernardo Rossellino's tomb of Leonardo Bruni;\\nin the left is that of Bruni's successor as Secretary of State, Carlo\\nMarsuppini, by Desiderio da Settignano, which is high among the most\\nbeautiful monuments that exist. \\\"Faine, faine!\\\" says Alfred Branconi,\\nwith his black eyes dimmed; and this though he has seen it every day\\nfor years and explained its beauties in the same words. Everything\\nabout it is beautiful, as the photograph which I give in this volume\\nwill help the reader to believe: proportions, figures, and tracery;\\nbut I still consider Mino's monument to Ugo in the Badia the finest\\nFlorentine example of the gentler memorial style, as contrasted with\\nthe severe Michelangelesque manner. Mino, it must be remembered,\\nwas Desiderio's pupil, as Desiderio was Donatello's. Note how\\nDesiderio, by an inspiration, opened the leaf-work at each side of\\nthe sarcophagus and instantly the great solid mass of marble became\\nlight, almost buoyant. Never can a few strokes of the chisel have had\\nso transforming an effect. There is some doubt as to whether the boys\\nare just where the sculptor set them, and the upper ones with their\\ngarlands are thought to be a later addition; but we are never likely\\nto know. The returned visitor from Florence will like to be reminded\\nthat, as of so many others of the best Florentine sculptures, there\\nis a cast of this at South Kensington.\\n\\nThe last tomb of the highest importance in the church is that of\\nGalileo, the astronomer, who died in 1642; but it is not interesting\\nas a work of art. In the centre of the church is a floor-tomb by\\nGhiberti, with a bronze figure of a famous Franciscan, Francesco\\nSansoni da Brescia.\\n\\nNext the sacristy. Italian priests apparently have no resentment\\nagainst inquisitive foreigners who are led into their dressing-rooms\\nwhile sumptuous and significant vestments are being donned; but I must\\nconfess to feeling it for them, and if my impressions of the S. Croce\\nsacristy are meagre and confused it is because of a certain delicacy\\nthat I experienced in intruding upon their rites. For on both occasions\\nwhen I visited the sacristy there were several priests either robing\\nor disrobing. Apart from a natural disinclination to invade privacy,\\nI am so poor a Roman Catholic as to be in some doubt as to whether one\\nhas a right to be so near such a mystery at all. But I recollect that\\nin this sacristy are treasures of wood and iron -- the most beautiful\\nintarsia wainscotting I ever saw, by Giovanni di Michele, with a frieze\\nof wolves and foliage, and fourteenth-century iron gates to the little\\nchapel, pure Gothic in design, with a little rose window at the top,\\ndelicate beyond words: all which things once again turn the thoughts\\nto this wonderful Italy of the fourteenth and fifteenth century,\\nwhen not even the best was good enough for those who built churches,\\nbut something miraculous was demanded from every craftsman.\\n\\nAt the end of the passage in which the sacristy is situated is the\\nexquisite little Cappella Medici, which Michelozzo, the architect of\\nS. Marco and the Palazzo Medici, and for a while Donatello's partner,\\nbuilt for his friend Cosimo de' Medici, who though a Dominican in his\\ncell at S. Marco was a Franciscan here, but by being equally a patron\\ndissociated himself from partisanship. Three treasures in particular\\ndoes this little temple hold: Giotto's \\\"Coronation of the Virgin\\\"; the\\ndella Robbia altar relief, and Mino da Fiesole's tabernacle. Giotto's\\npicture, which is signed, once stood as altar-piece in the Baroncelli\\nchapel of the church proper. In addition to the beautiful della\\nRobbia altar-piece, so happy and holy -- which Alfred Branconi boldly\\ncalls Luca -- there is over the door Christ between two angels,\\na lovely example of the same art. For a subtler, more modern and\\nless religious mind, we have but to turn to the tabernacle by Mino,\\nevery inch of which is exquisite.\\n\\nOn the same wall is a curious thing. In the eighteen-sixties died\\na Signor Lombardi, who owned certain reliefs which he believed to\\nbe Donatello's. When his monument was made these ancient works were\\nbuilt into them and here and there gilded (for it is a wicked world\\nand there was no taste at that time). One's impulse is not to look\\nat this encroaching piece of novelty at all; but one should resist\\nthat feeling, because, on examination, the Madonna and Children above\\nSignor Lombardi's head become exceedingly interesting. Her hands are\\nthe work of a great artist, and they are really holding the Child. Why\\nthis should not be an early Donatello I do not see.\\n\\nThe cloisters of S. Croce are entered from the piazza, just to the\\nright of the church: the first, a little ornate, by Arnolfo, and\\nthe second, until recently used as a barracks but now being restored\\nto a more pacific end, by Brunelleschi, and among the most perfect\\nof his works. Brunelleschi is also the designer of the Pazzi chapel\\nin the first cloisters. The severity of the fa\\u00e7ade is delightfully\\nsoftened and enlivened by a frieze of mischievous cherubs' heads, the\\njoint work of Donatello and Desiderio. Donatello's are on the right,\\nand one sees at once that his was the bolder, stronger hand. Look\\nparticularly at the laughing head fourth from the right. But that one\\nof Desiderio's over the middle columns has much charm and power. The\\ndoors, from Brunelleschi's own hand, in a doorway perfect in scale,\\nare noble and worthy. The chapel itself I find too severe and a little\\nfretted by its della Robbias and the multiplicity of circles. It is\\ncalled Brunelleschi's masterpiece, but I prefer both the Badia of\\nFiesole and the Old Sacristy at S. Lorenzo, and I remember with more\\npleasure the beautiful doorway leading from the Arnolfo cloisters\\nto the Brunelleschi cloisters, which probably is his too. The\\ndella Robbia reliefs, once one can forgive them for being here, are\\nworth study. Nothing could be more charming (or less conducive to a\\nmethodical literary morning) than the angel who holds S. Matthew's\\nink-pot. But I think my favourite of all is the pensive apostle who\\nleans his cheek on his hand and his elbow on his book. This figure\\nalone proves what a sculptor Luca was, apart altogether from the\\ncharm of his mind and the fascination of his chosen medium.\\n\\nThis chapel was once the scene of a gruesome ceremony. Old Jacopo\\nPazzi, the head of the family at the time of the Pazzi conspiracy\\nagainst the Medici, after being hanged from a window of the Palazzo\\nVecchio, was buried here. Some short while afterwards Florence was\\ninundated by rain to such an extent that the vengeance of God was\\ninferred, and, casting about for a reason, the Florentines decided\\nthat it was because Jacopo had been allowed to rest in sacred soil. A\\nmob therefore rushed to S. Croce, broke open his tomb and dragged\\nhis body through the streets, stopping on their way at the Pazzi\\npalace to knock on the door with his skull. He was then thrown into\\nthe swollen Arno and borne away by the tide.\\n\\nIn the old refectory of the convent are now a number of pictures\\nand fragments of sculpture. The \\\"Last Supper,\\\" by Taddeo Gaddi, on\\nthe wall, is notable for depicting Judas, who had no shrift at the\\nhands of the painters, without a halo. Castagno and Ghirlandaio,\\nas we shall see, under similar circumstances, placed him on the\\nwrong side of the table. In either case, but particularly perhaps in\\nTaddeo's picture, the answer to Christ's question, which Leonardo at\\nMilan makes so dramatic, is a foregone conclusion. The \\\"Crucifixion\\\"\\non the end wall, at the left, is interesting as having been painted\\nfor the Porta S. Gallo (in the Piazza Cavour) and removed here. All\\nthe gates of Florence had religious frescoes in them, some of which\\nstill remain. The great bronze bishop is said to be by Donatello and\\nto have been meant for Or San Michele; but one does not much mind.\\n\\nOne finds occasion to say so many hard things of the Florentine\\ndisregard of ancient art that it is peculiarly a pleasure to see\\nthe progress that is being made in restoring Brunelleschi's perfect\\ncloisters at S. Croce to their original form. When they were turned\\ninto barracks the Loggia was walled in all round and made into a series\\nof rooms. These walls are now gradually coming away, the lovely pillars\\nbeing again isolated, the chimneys removed, and everything lightly\\nwashed. Grass has also been sown in the great central square. The\\ncrumbling of the decorative medals in the spandrels of the cloisters\\ncannot of course be restored; but one does not complain of such\\nnatural decay as that.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nThe Accademia\\n\\nMichelangelo -- The David -- The tomb of Julius -- A contrast -- Fra\\nAngelico -- The beatific painter -- Cimabue and Giotto -- Masaccio -- Gentile\\nda Fabriano -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Fra Angelico again -- Fra\\nBartolommeo -- Perugino -- Botticelli -- The \\\"Primavera\\\" -- Leonardo da Vinci\\nand Verrocchio -- Botticelli's sacred pictures -- Botticini -- Tapestries\\nof Eden.\\n\\nThe Accademia delle Belle Arti is in the Via Ricasoli, that street\\nwhich seen from the top of the Campanile is the straightest thing in\\nFlorence, running like a ruled line from the Duomo to the valley of\\nthe Mugnone. Upstairs are modern painters: but upstairs I have never\\nbeen. It is the ground-floor rooms that are so memorable, containing\\nas they do a small but very choice collection of pictures illustrating\\nthe growth of Italian art, with particular emphasis on Florentine\\nart; the best assemblage of the work of Fra Angelico that exists;\\nand a large gallery given up to Michelangelo's sculpture: originals\\nand casts. The principal magnets that draw people here, no doubt,\\nare the Fra Angelicos and Botticelli's \\\"Primavera\\\"; but in five at\\nleast of the rooms there is not an uninteresting picture, while the\\ncollection is so small that one can study it without fatigue -- no\\nlittle matter after the crowded Uffizi and Pitti.\\n\\nIt is a simple matter to choose in such a book as this the best\\nplace in which to tell something of the life-story of, say, Giotto\\nand Brunelleschi and the della Robbias; for at a certain point their\\ngenius is found concentrated -- Donatello's and the della Robbias'\\nin the Bargello and those others at the Duomo and Campanile. But\\nwith Michelangelo it is different, he is so distributed over the\\ncity -- his gigantic David here, the Medici tombs at S. Lorenzo, his\\nfortifications at S. Miniato, his tomb at S. Croce, while there remains\\nhis house as a natural focus of all his activities. I have, however,\\nchosen the Medici chapel as the spot best suited for his biography,\\nand therefore will here dwell only on the originals that are preserved\\nabout the David. The David himself, superb and confident, is the\\nfirst thing you see in entering the doors of the gallery. He stands\\nat the end, white and glorious, with his eyes steadfastly measuring\\nhis antagonist and calculating upon what will be his next move if the\\nsling misdirects the stone. Of the objection to the statue as being\\nnot representative of the Biblical figure I have said something in the\\nchapter on the Bargello, where several Davids come under review. Yet,\\nafter all that can be said against its dramatic fitness, the statue\\nremains an impressive and majestic yet strangely human thing. There\\nit is -- a sign of what a little Italian sculptor with a broken nose\\ncould fashion with his mallet and chisel from a mass of marble four\\nhundred and more years ago.\\n\\nIts history is curious. In 1501, when Michelangelo was twenty-six\\nand had just returned to Florence from Rome with a great reputation\\nas a sculptor, the joint authorities of the cathedral and the Arte\\ndella Lana offered him a huge block of marble that had been in their\\npossession for thirty-five years, having been worked upon clumsily by\\na sculptor named Baccellino and then set aside. Michelangelo was told\\nthat if he accepted it he must carve from it a David and have it done\\nin two years. He began in September, 1501, and finished in January,\\n1504, and a committee was appointed to decide upon its position,\\namong them being Leonardo da Vinci, Perugino, Lorenzo di Credi,\\nFilippino Lippi, Botticelli, and Andrea della Robbia, There were\\nthree suggested sites: the Loggia de' Lanzi; the courtyard of the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, where Verrocchio's little boudoir David then stood\\n(now in the Bargello) and where his Cupid and dolphin now are; and\\nthe place where it now stands, then occupied by Donatello's Judith and\\nHolofernes. This last was finally selected, not by the committee but by\\nthe determination of Michelangelo himself, and Judith and Holofernes\\nwere moved to the Loggia de' Lanzi to their present position. The\\nDavid was set up in May, 1504, and remained there for three hundred\\nand sixty-nine years, suffering no harm from the weather but having\\nan arm broken in the Medici riots in 1527. In 1878, however, it was\\ndecided that further exposure might be injurious, and so the statue\\nwas moved here to its frigid niche and a replica in marble afterwards\\nset up in its place. Since this glorious figure is to be seen thrice\\nin Florence, he may be said to have become the second symbol of the\\ncity, next the fleur-de-lis.\\n\\nThe Tribuna del David, as the Michelangelo salon is called, has\\namong other originals several figures intended for that tomb of Pope\\nJulius II (whose portrait by Raphael we have seen at the Uffizi)\\nwhich was to be the eighth wonder of the world, and by which the last\\nyears of the sculptor's life were rendered so unhappy. The story\\nis a miserable one. Of the various component parts of the tomb,\\nfinished or unfinished, the best known is the Moses at S. Pietro\\nin Vincoli at Rome, reproduced in plaster here, in the Accademia,\\nbeneath the bronze head of its author. Various other parts are in Rome\\ntoo; others here; one or two may be at the Bargello (although some\\nauthorities give these supposed Michelangelos to Vincenzo Danti);\\nothers are in the grotto of the Boboli Gardens; and the Louvre has\\nwhat is in some respects the finest of the \\\"Prisoners\\\".\\n\\nThe first statue on the right of the entrance of the Tribuna del David\\nis a group called \\\"Genio Vittorioso\\\". Here in the old man we see rock\\nactually turned to life; in the various \\\"Prisoners\\\" near we see life\\nemerging from rock; in the David we forget the rock altogether. One\\nwonders how Michelangelo went to work. Did the shape of the block\\nof marble influence him, or did he with his mind's eye, the R\\u00f6ntgen\\nrays of genius, see the figure within it, embedded in the midst, and\\nhew and chip until it disclosed? On the back of the fourth statue on\\nthe left a monkish face has been incised: probably some visitor to the\\nstudio. After looking at these originals and casts, and remembering\\nthose other Michelangelo sculptures elsewhere in Florence -- the tombs\\nof the Medici, the Brutus and the smaller David -- turn to the bronze\\nhead over the cast of Moses and reflect upon the author of it all:\\nthe profoundly sorrowful eyes behind which so much power and ambition\\nand disappointment dwelt.\\n\\nIt is peculiarly interesting to walk out of the Michelangelo gallery\\ninto the little room containing the Fra Angelicos: to pass from a great\\nmelancholy saturnine sculptor, the victim of the caprice of princes\\ntemporal and spiritual, his eyes troubled with world knowledge and\\nworld weariness, to the child-like celebrant of the joy of simple faith\\nwho painted these gay and happy pictures. Fra Angelico -- the sweetest\\nof all the Florentine painters -- was a monk of Fiesole, whose real name\\nwas Guido Petri da Mugello, but becoming a Dominican he called himself\\nGiovanni, and now through the sanctity and happiness of his brush is\\nfor all time Beato Angelico. He was born in 1390, nearly sixty years\\nafter Giotto's death, when Chaucer was fifty, and Richard II on the\\nEnglish throne. His early years were spent in exile from Fiesole,\\nthe brothers having come into difficulties with the Archbishop,\\nbut by 1418 he was again at Fiesole, and when in 1436 Cosimo de'\\nMedici, returned from exile at Venice, set his friend Michelozzo\\nupon building the convent of S. Marco, Fra Angelico was fetched from\\nFiesole to decorate the walls. There, and here, in the Accademia, are\\nhis chief works assembled; but he worked also at Fiesole, at Cortona,\\nand at Rome, where he painted frescoes in the chapel of Nicholas V in\\nthe Vatican and where he died, aged sixty-eight, and was buried. It\\nwas while at Rome that the Pope offered him the priorship of S. Marco,\\nwhich he declined as being unworthy, but recommended Antonio, \\\"the good\\narchbishop\\\". -- That practically is his whole life. As to his character,\\nlet Vasari tell us. \\\"He would often say that whosoever practised art\\nneeded a quiet life and freedom from care, and he who occupies himself\\nwith the things of Christ ought always to be with Christ. . . . Some\\nsay that Fra Giovanni never took up his brush without first making a\\nprayer. . . . He never made a crucifix when the tears did not course\\ndown his cheeks.\\\" The one curious thing -- to me -- about Fra Angelico\\nis that he has not been canonized. If ever a son of the Church toiled\\nfor her honour and for the happiness of mankind it was he.\\n\\nThere are examples of Fra Angelico's work elsewhere in Florence;\\nthe large picture in Room I of this gallery; the large altar-piece\\nat the Uffizi, with certain others; the series of mural paintings\\nin the cells of S. Marco; and his pictures will be found not only\\nelsewhere in Florence and Italy but in the chief galleries of the\\nworld; for he was very assiduous. We have an excellent example at\\nthe National Gallery, No. 663; but this little room gives us the\\nartist and rhapsodist most completely. In looking at his pictures,\\nthree things in particular strike the mind: the skill with which he\\ncomposed them; his mastery of light; and -- and here he is unique -- the\\npleasure he must have had in painting them. All seem to have been play;\\nhe enjoyed the toil exactly as a child enjoys the labour of building\\na house with toy bricks. Nor, one feels, could he be depressed. Even\\nin his Crucifixions there is a certain underlying happiness, due\\nto his knowledge that the Crucified was to rise again and ascend to\\nHeaven and enjoy eternal felicity. Knowing this (as he did know it)\\nhow could he be wholly cast down? You see it again in the Flagellation\\nof Christ, in the series of six scenes (No. 237). The scourging is\\nalmost a festival. But best of all I like the Flight into Egypt, in\\nNo. 235. Everything here is joyous and (in spite of the terrible cause\\nof the journey) bathed in the sunny light of the age of innocence:\\nthe landscape; Joseph, younger than usual, brave and resolute and\\nundismayed by the curious turn in his fortunes; and Mary with the\\nchild in her arms, happy and pretty, seated securely on an amiable\\ndonkey that has neither bit nor bridle. It is when one looks at\\nFra Angelico that one understands how wise were the Old Masters to\\nseek their inspiration in the life of Christ. One cannot imagine Fra\\nAngelico's existence in a pagan country. Look, in No. 236, at the six\\nradiant and rapturous angels clustering above the manger. Was there\\never anything prettier? But I am not sure that I do not most covet\\nNo. 250, Christ crucified and two saints, and No. 251, the Coronation\\nof the Virgin, for their beauty of light.\\n\\nIn the photographs No. 246 -- a Deposition -- is unusually striking,\\nbut in the original, although beautiful, it is far less radiant than\\nusual with this painter. It has, however, such feeling as to make it\\nespecially memorable among the many treatments of this subject. What\\nis generally considered the most important work in this room is the\\nLast Judgment, which is certainly extraordinarily interesting, and in\\nthe hierarchy of heaven and the company of the blest Fra Angelico is\\nin a very acceptable mood. The benignant Christ Who divides the sheep\\nand the goats; the healthy ripe-lipped Saints and Fathers who assist\\nat the tribunal and have never a line of age or experience on their\\nblooming cheeks; the monks and nuns, just risen from their graves, who\\nembrace each other in the meads of paradise with such fervour -- these\\nhave much of the charm of little flowers. But in delineating the damned\\nthe painter is in strange country. It was a subject of which he knew\\nnothing, and the introduction among them of monks of the rival order\\nof S. Francis is mere party politics and a blot.\\n\\nThere are two other rooms here, but Fra Angelico spoils us for\\nthem. Four panels by another Frate, but less radiant, Lippo Lippi, are\\nremarkable, particularly the figure of the Virgin in the Annunciation;\\nand there is a curious series of scenes entitled \\\"L'Albero della\\nCroce,\\\" by an Ignoto of the fourteenth century, with a Christ crucified\\nin the midst and all Scripture in medallions around him, the tragedy of\\nAdam and Eve at the foot (mutilated by some chaste pedant) being very\\nquaint. And in Angelico's rooms there is a little, modest Annunciation\\nby one of his school -- No. 256 -- which shows what a good influence he\\nwas, and to which the eye returns and returns. Here also, on easels,\\nare two portraits of Vallombrosan monks by Fra Bartolommeo, serene,\\nand very sympathetically painted, which cause one to regret the\\ndeterioration in Italian ecclesiastic physiognomy; and Andrea del\\nSarto's two pretty angels, which one so often finds in reproduction,\\nare here too.\\n\\nLet us now enter the first room of the collection proper and begin at\\nthe very beginning of Tuscan art, for this collection is historical\\nand not fortuitous like that of the Pitti. The student may here trace\\nthe progress of Tuscan painting from the level to the highest peaks\\nand downwards again. The Accademia was established with this purpose\\nby that enlightened prince, Peter Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany,\\nin 1784. Other pictures not wholly within his scheme have been added\\nsince, together with the Michelangelo statues and casts; but they do\\nnot impair the original idea. For the serious student the first room\\nis of far the most importance, for there he may begin with Cimabue\\n(? 1240-? 1302), and Giotto (1267-? 1337), and pass steadily to Luca\\nSignorelli (? 1450-1523). For the most part the pictures in this room\\nappeal to the inquirer rather than the sightseer; but there is not\\none that is without interest, while three works of extraordinary charm\\nhave thoughtfully been enisled, on screens, for special attention -- a\\nFra Angelico, a Fabriano, and a Ghirlandaio. Before reaching these,\\nlet us look at the walls.\\n\\nThe first large picture, on the left, the Cimabue, marks the transition\\nfrom Byzantine art to Italian art. Giovanni Cimabue, who was to be\\nthe forerunner of the new art, was born about 1240. At that time\\nthere was plenty of painting in Italy, but it was Greek, the work of\\nartists at Constantinople (Byzantium), the centre of Christianity in\\nthe eastern half of the Roman Empire and the fount of ecclesiastical\\nenergy, and it was crude workmanship, existing purely as an accessory\\nof worship. Cimabue, of whom, I may say, almost nothing definite\\nis known, and upon whom the delightful but casual old Vasari is the\\nearliest authority, as Dante was his first eulogist, carried on the\\nByzantine tradition, but breathed a little life into it. In his picture\\nhere we see him feeling his way from the unemotional painted symbols\\nof the Faith to humanity itself. One can understand this large panel\\nbeing carried (as we know the similar one at S. Maria Novella was)\\nin procession and worshipped, but it is nearer to the icon of the\\nRussian peasant of today than to a Raphael. The Madonna is above\\nlife; the Child is a little man. This was painted, say, in 1280,\\nas an altar-piece for the Badia of S. Trinit\\u00e0 at Florence.\\n\\nNext came Giotto, Cimabue's pupil, born about 1267, whom we have\\nmet already as an architect, philosopher, and innovator; and in the\\nsecond picture in this room, from Giotto's brush, we see life really\\nawakening. The Madonna is vivifying; the Child is nearer childhood; we\\ncan believe that here are veins with blood in them. Moreover, whereas\\nCimabue's angels brought masonry, these bring flowers. It is crude,\\nno doubt, but it is enough; the new art, which was to counterfeit\\nand even extend nature, has really begun; the mystery and glory of\\npainting are assured and the door opened for Botticelli.\\n\\nBut much had to happen first, particularly the mastery of the laws of\\nperspective, and it was not (as we have seen) until Ghiberti had got\\nto work on his first doors, and Brunelleschi was studying architecture\\nand Uccello sitting up all night at his desk, that painting as we\\nknow it -- painting of men and women \\\"in the round\\\" -- could be done,\\nand it was left for a youth who was not born until Giotto had been\\ndead sixty-four years to do this first as a master -- one Tommaso\\ndi Ser Giovanni Guido da Castel San Giovanni, known as Masaccio,\\nor Big Tom. The three great names then in the evolution of Italian\\npainting, a subject to which I return in chapter XXV, on the Carmine,\\nare Cimabue, Giotto, Masaccio.\\n\\nWe pass on at the Accademia from Cimabue's pupil Giotto, to Giotto's\\nfollowers, Taddeo Gaddi and Bernardo Daddi, and Daddi's follower\\nSpinello Aretino, and the long dependent and interdependent line of\\npainters. For the most part they painted altar-pieces, these early\\ncraftsmen, the Church being the principal patron of art. These\\nworks are many of them faded and so elementary as to have but an\\nantiquarian interest; but think of the excitement in those days when\\nthe picture was at last ready, and, gay in its gold, was erected in the\\nchapel! Among the purely ecclesiastical works No. 137, an Annunciation\\nby Giovanni del Biondo (second half of the fourteenth century),\\nis light and cheerful, and No. 142, the Crowning of the Virgin, by\\nRosello di Jacopo Franchi (1376-1456), has some delightful details and\\nis everywhere joyous, with a charming green pattern in it. The wedding\\nscenes in No. 147 give us Florentine life on the mundane side with\\nsome valuable thoroughness, and the Pietro Lorenzetti above -- scenes\\nin the life of S. Umilita -- is very quaint and cheery and was painted\\nas early as 1316. The little Virgin adoring, No. 160, in the corner,\\nby the fertile Ignoto, is charmingly pretty.\\n\\nAnd now for the three screens, notable among the screens of the\\ngalleries of Europe as holding three of the happiest pictures\\never painted. The first is the Adoration of the Magi, by Gentile\\nda Fabriano, an artist of whom one sees too little. His full\\nname was Gentile di Niccol\\u00f2 di Giovanni Massi, and he was born\\nat Fabriano between 1360 and 1370, some twenty years before Fra\\nAngelico. According to Vasari he was Fra Angelico's master, but\\nthat is now considered doubtful, and yet the three little scenes\\nfrom the life of Christ in the predella of this picture are nearer\\nFra Angelico in spirit and charm than any, not by a follower, that I\\nhave seen. Gentile did much work at Venice before he came to Florence,\\nin 1422, and this picture, which is considered his masterpiece, was\\npainted in 1423 for S. Trinita. He died four years later. Gentile\\nwas charming rather than great, and to this work might be applied\\nRuskin's sarcastic description of poor Ghirlandaio's frescoes, that\\nthey are mere goldsmith's work; and yet it is much more, for it has\\ngaiety and sweetness and the nice thoughtfulness that made the Child a\\nreal child, interested like a child in the bald head of the kneeling\\nmage; while the predella is not to be excelled in its modest, tender\\nbeauty by any in Florence; and predellas, I may remark again, should\\nnever be overlooked, strong as the tendency is to miss them. Many\\na painter has failed in the large space or made only a perfunctory\\nsuccess, but in the small has achieved real feeling. Gentile's Holy\\nFamily on its way to Egypt is never to be forgotten. Not so radiant\\nas Fra Angelico's, in the room we have visited out of due course,\\nbut as charming in its own manner -- both in personages and landscape;\\nwhile the city to which Joseph leads the donkey (again without reins)\\nis the most perfect thing out of fairyland.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's picture, which is the neighbour of Gentile's, is as\\na whole nearer life and one of his most attractive works. It is,\\nI think, excelled only by his very similar Adoration of the Magi\\nat the Spedale degli Innocenti, which, however, it is difficult to\\nsee; and it is far beyond the examples at the Uffizi, which are too\\nhot. Of the life of this artist, who was Michelangelo's master, I\\nshall speak in the chapter on S. Maria Novella. This picture, which\\nrepresents the Adoration of the Shepherds, was painted in 1485, when\\nthe artist was thirty-six. It is essentially pleasant: a religious\\npicture on the sunny side. The Child is the soul of babyish content,\\nequally amused with its thumb and the homage it is receiving. Close\\nby is a goldfinch unafraid; in the distance is a citied valley, with\\na river winding in it; and down a neighbouring hill, on the top of\\nwhich the shepherds feed their flocks, comes the imposing procession\\nof the Magi. Joseph is more than commonly perplexed, and the disparity\\nbetween his own and his wife's age, which the old masters agreed to\\nmake considerable, is more considerable than usual.\\n\\nBoth Gentile and Ghirlandaio chose a happy subject and made it happier;\\nFra Angelico (for the third screen picture) chose a melancholy\\nsubject and made it happy, not because that was his intention, but\\nbecause he could not help it. He had only one set of colours and one\\nset of countenances, and since the colours were of the gayest and the\\ncountenances of the serenest, the result was bound to be peaceful and\\nglad. This picture is a large \\\"Deposizione della Croce,\\\" an altar-piece\\nfor S. Trinit\\u00e0. There is such joy in the painting and light in the\\nsky that a child would clap his hands at it all, and not least at\\nthe vermilion of the Redeemer's blood. Fra Angelico gave thought to\\nevery touch: and his beatific holiness floods the work. Each of these\\nthree great pictures, I may add, has its original frame.\\n\\nThe room which leads from this one is much less valuable; but Fra\\nBartolommeo's Vision of S. Bernard has lately been brought to an easel\\nhere to give it character. I find this the Frate's most beautiful\\nwork. It may have details that are a little crude, and the pointed nose\\nof the Virgin is not perhaps in accordance with the best tradition,\\nwhile she is too real for an apparition; but the figure of the kneeling\\nsaint is masterly and the landscape lovely in subject and feeling. Here\\ntoo is Fra Bartolommeo's portrait of Savonarola, in which the reformer\\nis shown as personating S. Peter Martyr. The picture was not painted\\nfrom life, but from an earlier portrait. Fra Bartolommeo had some\\nreason to know what Savonarola was like, for he was his personal\\nfriend and a brother in the same convent of S. Marco, a few yards\\nfrom the Accademia, across the square. He was born in 1475 and was\\napprenticed to the painter Cosimo Rosselli; but he learned more from\\nstudying Masaccio's frescoes at the Carmine and the work of Leonardo da\\nVinci. It was in 1495 that he came under the influence of Savonarola,\\nand he was the first artist to run home and burn his studies from the\\nnude in response to the preacher's denunciations. Three years later,\\nwhen Savonarola was an object of hatred and the convent of S. Marco\\nwas besieged, the artist was with him, and he then made a vow that if\\nhe lived he would join the order; and this promise he kept, although\\nnot until Savonarola had been executed. For a while, as a monk, he\\nlaid aside the brush, but in 1506 he resumed it and painted until\\nhis death, in 1517. He was buried at S. Marco.\\n\\nIn his less regenerate days Fra Bartolommeo's greatest friend was the\\njovial Mariotto Albertinelli, whose rather theatrical Annunciation\\nhangs between a number of the monk's other portraits, all very\\ninteresting. Of Albertinelli I have spoken earlier. Before leaving,\\nlook at the tiny Ignoto next the door -- a Madonna and Child, the child\\neating a pomegranate. It is a little picture to steal.\\n\\nIn the next room are a number of the later and showy painters, such as\\nCarlo Dolci, Lorenzo Lippi, and Francesco Furini, all bold, dashing,\\nself-satisfied hands, in whom (so near the real thing) one can take\\nno interest. Nothing to steal here.\\n\\nReturning through Sala Prima we come to the Sala del Perugino and\\nare among the masters once more -- riper and richer than most of\\nthose we have already seen, for Tuscan art here reaches its finest\\nflower. Perugino is here and Botticelli, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo,\\nLuca Signorelli, Fra Lippo Lippi and Filippino Lippi. And here is a\\nMasaccio. The great Perugino Assumption has all his mellow sunset calm,\\nand never was a landscape more tenderly sympathetic. The same painter's\\nDeposition hangs next, and the custodian brings a magnifying glass\\nthat the tears on the Magdalen's cheek may be more closely observed;\\nbut the third, No. 53, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is finer,\\nand here again the landscape and light are perfect. For the rest,\\nthere is a Royal Academy Andrea and a formal Ghirlandaio.\\n\\nAnd now we come to Botticelli, who although less richly represented\\nin numbers than at the Uffizi, is for the majority of his admirers\\nmore to be sought here, by reason of the \\\"Primavera\\\" allegory,\\nwhich is the Accademia's most powerful magnet. The Botticellis are\\ndivided between two rooms, the \\\"Primavera\\\" being in the first. The\\nfirst feeling one has is how much cooler it is here than among the\\nPeruginos, and how much gayer; for not only is there the \\\"Primavera,\\\"\\nbut Fra Lippo Lippi is here too, with a company of angels helping\\nto crown the Virgin, and a very sweet, almost transparent, little\\nMadonna adoring -- No. 79 -- which one cannot forget.\\n\\nThe \\\"Primavera\\\" is not wearing too well: one sees that at once. Being\\nin tempera it cannot be cleaned, and a dulness is overlaying it; but\\nnothing can deprive the figure of Spring of her joy and movement,\\na floating type of conquering beauty and youth. The most wonderful\\nthing about this wonderful picture is that it should have been painted\\nwhen it was: that, suddenly, out of a solid phalanx of Madonnas should\\nhave stepped these radiant creatures of the joyous earth, earthy and\\njoyful. And not only that they should have so surprisingly and suddenly\\nemerged, but that after all these years this figure of Spring should\\nstill be the finest of her kind. That is the miracle! Luca Signorelli's\\nflowers at the Uffizi remain the best, but Botticelli's are very\\nthoughtful and before the grass turned black they must have been very\\nlovely; the exquisite drawing of the irises in the right-hand corner\\ncan still be traced, although the colour has gone. The effect now is\\nrather like a Chinese painting. For the history of the \\\"Primavera\\\"\\nand its signification, one must turn back to Chapter X.\\n\\nI spoke just now of Luca's flowers. There are others in his picture in\\nthis room -- botanist's flowers as distinguished from painter's flowers:\\nthe wild strawberry beautifully straggling. This picture is one of\\nthe most remarkable in all Florence to me: a Crucifixion to which\\nthe perishing of the colour has given an effect of extreme delicacy,\\nwhile the group round the cross on the distant mound has a quality for\\nwhich one usually goes to Spanish art. The Magdalen is curiously sulky\\nand human. Into the skull at the foot of the cross creeps a lizard.\\n\\nThis room has three Lippo Lippis, which is an interesting circumstance\\nwhen we remember that that dissolute brother was the greatest influence\\non Botticelli. The largest is the Coronation of the Virgin with its\\nmany lilies -- a picture which one must delight in, so happy and crowded\\nis it, but which never seems to me quite what it should be. The most\\nfascinating part of it is the figures in the two little medallions:\\ntwo perfect pieces of colour and design. The kneeling monk on the\\nright is Lippo Lippi himself. Near it is the Madonna adoring, No. 79,\\nof which I have spoken, with herself so luminous and the background\\nso dark; the other -- No. 82 -- is less remarkable. No. 81, above it,\\nis by Browning's Pacchiorotto (who worked in distemper); close by\\nis the Masaccio, which has a deep, quiet beauty; and beneath it is a\\nrichly coloured predella by Andrea del Sarto, the work of a few hours,\\nI should guess, and full of spirit and vigour. It consists of four\\nscriptural scenes which might be called the direct forerunners of\\nSir John Gilbert and the modern illustrators. Lastly we have what\\nis in many ways the most interesting picture in Florence -- No. 71,\\nthe Baptism of Christ -- for it is held by some authorities to be the\\nonly known painting by Verrocchio, whose sculptures we saw in the\\nBargello and at Or San Michele, while in one of the angels -- that\\nsurely on the left -- we are to see the hand of his pupil Leonardo da\\nVinci. Their faces are singularly sweet. Other authorities consider\\nnot only that Verrocchio painted the whole picture himself but that\\nhe painted also the Annunciation at the Uffizi to which Leonardo's\\nname is given. Be that as it may -- and we shall never know -- this\\nis a beautiful thing. According to Vasari it was the excellence\\nof Leonardo's contribution which decided Verrocchio to give up the\\nbrush. Among the thoughts of Leonardo is one which comes to mind with\\npeculiar force before this work when we know its story: \\\"Poor is the\\npupil who does not surpass his master\\\".\\n\\nThe second Sala di Botticelli has not the value of the first. It\\nhas magnificent examples of Botticelli's sacred work, but the other\\npictures are not the equal of those in the other rooms. Chief of the\\nBotticellis is No. 85, \\\"The Virgin and Child with divers Saints,\\\" in\\nwhich there are certain annoying and restless elements. One feels that\\nin the accessories -- the flooring, the curtains, and gilt -- the painter\\nwas wasting his time, while the Child is too big. Botticelli was seldom\\ntoo happy with his babies. But the face of the Saint in green and blue\\non the left is most exquisitely painted, and the Virgin has rather less\\ntroubled beauty than usual. The whole effect is not quite spiritual,\\nand the symbolism of the nails and the crown of thorns held up for\\nthe Child to see is rather too cruel and obvious. I like better the\\nsmaller picture with the same title -- No. 88 -- in which the Saints at\\neach side are wholly beautiful in Botticelli's wistful way, and the\\npainting of their heads and head-dresses is so perfect as to fill\\none with a kind of despair. But taken altogether one must consider\\nBotticelli's triumph in the Accademia to be pagan rather than sacred.\\n\\nNo. 8, called officially School of Verrocchio, and by one firm of\\nphotographers Botticini, and by another Botticelli, is a fine free\\nthing, low in colour, with a quiet landscape, and is altogether a\\ndelight. It represents Tobias and the three angels, and Raphael moves\\nnobly, although not with quite such a step as the radiant figure in a\\nsomewhat similar picture in our own National Gallery -- No. 781 -- which,\\nonce confidently given to Verrocchio, is now attributed to Botticini;\\nwhile our No. 296, which the visitor from Florence on returning to\\nLondon should hasten to examine, is no longer Verrocchio but School\\nof Verrocchio. When we think of these attributions and then look at\\nNo. 154 in the Accademia -- another Tobias and the Angel, here given\\nto Botticini -- we have a concrete object lesson in the perilous career\\nthat awaits the art expert,\\n\\nThe other pictures here are two sunny panels by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio,\\nhigh up, with nice easy colouring; No. 92, an Adoration of the\\nShepherds by Lorenzo di Credi, with a good landscape and all very\\nsweet and quiet; No. 98, a Deposition by Filippino Lippi and Perugino,\\nin collaboration, with very few signs of Filippino; and No. 90,\\na Resurrection by Raffaellino del Garbo, an uncommon painter in\\nFlorence; the whole thing a tour de force, but not important.\\n\\nAnd now let us look at the Angelicos again.\\n\\nBefore leaving the Accademia for the last time, one should glance\\nat the tapestries near the main entrance, just for fun. That one in\\nwhich Adam names the animals is so delightfully naive that it ought to\\nbe reproduced as a nursery wall-paper. The creatures pass in review\\nin four processions, and Adam must have had to be uncommonly quick\\nto make up his mind first and then rattle out their resultant names\\nin the time. The main procession is that of the larger quadrupeds,\\nheaded by the unicorn in single glory; and the moment chosen by the\\nartist is that in which the elephant, having just heard his name\\n(for the first time) and not altogether liking it, is turning towards\\nAdam in surprised remonstrance. The second procession is of reptiles,\\nled by the snail; the third, the smaller quadrupeds, led by four rats,\\nfollowed desperately close (but of course under the white flag) by two\\ncats; while the fourth -- all sorts and conditions of birds -- streams\\nthrough the air. The others in this series are all delightful, not\\nthe least being that in which God, having finished His work, takes\\nAdam's arm and flies with him over the earth to point out its merits.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nTwo Monasteries and a Procession\\n\\nThe Certosa -- A Company of Uncles -- The\\nCells -- Machiavelli -- Impruneta -- The\\ndella Robbias -- Pontassieve -- Pelago -- Milton's\\nsimile -- Vallombrosa -- S.

They can be bought in Florence itself, it is true (at a shop\\nat the corner of the Via de' Cerretani, close to the Baptistery),\\nbut the Certosa is far too interesting to miss, if one has time to\\nspare from the city's own treasures. The trams start from the Mercato\\nNuovo and come along the Via dell' Arcivescovado to the Baptistery,\\nand so to the Porta Romana and out into the hilly country. The ride\\nis dull and rather tiresome, for there is much waiting at sidings,\\nbut the expedition becomes attractive immediately the tram is\\nleft. There is then a short walk, principally up the long narrow\\napproach to the monastery gates, outside which, when I was there,\\nwas sitting a beggar at a stone table, waiting for the bowl of soup\\nto which all who ask are entitled.\\n\\nPassing within the courtyard you ring the bell on the right and enter\\nthe waiting hall, from which, in the course of time, when a sufficient\\nparty has been gathered, an elderly monk in a white robe leads you\\naway. How many monks there may be, I cannot say; but of the few of whom\\nI caught a glimpse, all were alike in the possession of white beards,\\nand all suggested uncles in fancy dress. Ours spoke good French and\\nwas clearly a man of parts. Lulled by his soothing descriptions I\\npassed in a kind of dream through this ancient abode of peace.\\n\\nThe Certosa dates from 1341 and was built and endowed by a wealthy\\nmerchant named Niccolo Acciaioli, after whom the Lungarno Acciaioli\\nis named. The members of the family are still buried here, certain\\nof the tombstones bearing dates of the present century. To-day it is\\nlittle but a show place, the cells of the monks being mostly empty and\\nthe sale of the liqueur its principal reason for existence. But the\\nmonks who are left take a pride in their church, which is attributed\\nto Orcagna, and its possessions, among which come first the relief\\nmonuments of early Acciaioli in the floor of one of the chapels -- the\\nfounder's being perhaps also the work of Orcagna, while that of his son\\nLorenzo, who died in 1353, is attributed by our cicerone to Donatello,\\nbut by others to an unknown hand. It is certainly very beautiful. These\\ntombs are the very reverse of those which we saw in S. Croce; for\\nthose bear the obliterating traces of centuries of footsteps, so that\\nsome are nearly flat with the stones, whereas these have been railed\\noff for ever and have lost nothing. The other famous Certosa tomb is\\nthat of Cardinal Angelo Acciaioli, which, once given to Donatello,\\nis now sometimes attributed to Giuliano di Sangallo and sometimes to\\nhis son Francesco.\\n\\nThe Certosa has a few good pictures, but it is as a monastery that\\nit is most interesting: as one of the myriad lonely convents of\\nItaly, which one sees so constantly from the train, perched among\\nthe Apennines, and did not expect ever to enter. The cloisters\\nwhich surround the garden, in the centre of which is a well, and\\nbeneath which is the distillery, are very memorable, not only for\\ntheir beauty but for the sixty and more medallions of saints and\\nevangelists all round it by Giovanni della Robbia. Here the monks\\nhave sunned themselves, and here been buried, these five and a half\\ncenturies. One suite of rooms is shown, with its own little private\\ngarden and no striking discomfort except the hole in the wall by\\nthe bed, through which the sleeper is awakened. From its balcony one\\nsees the Etna far below and hears the roar of a weir, and away in the\\ndistance is Florence with the Duomo and a third of Giotto's Campanile\\nvisible above the intervening hills.\\n\\nHaving shown you all the sights the monk leads you again to the\\nentrance hall and bids you good-bye, with murmurs of surprise and\\na hint of reproach on discovering a coin in his hand, for which,\\nhowever, none the less, he manages in the recesses of his robe to\\nfind a place; and you are then directed to the room where the liqueur,\\ntogether with sweets and picture post-cards, is sold by another monk,\\nassisted by a lay attendant, and the visit to the Certosa is over.\\n\\nThe tram that passes the Certosa continues to S. Casciano in the\\nChianti district (but much wine is called Chianti that never came\\nfrom here), where there is a point of interest in the house to which\\nMachiavelli retired in 1512, to give himself to literature and to live\\nthat wonderful double life -- a peasant loafer by day in the fields and\\nthe village inn, and at night, dressed in his noblest clothes, the\\ncold, sagacious mentor of the rulers of mankind. But at S. Casciano\\nI did not stop.\\n\\nAnd farther still one comes to the village of Impruneta, after climbing\\nhigher and higher, with lovely calm valleys on either side coloured\\nby silver olive groves and vivid wheat and maize, and studded with\\nwhite villas and villages and church towers. On the road every woman\\nin every doorway plaits straw with rapid fingers just as if we were in\\nBedfordshire. Impruneta is famous for its new terra-cotta vessels and\\nits ancient della Robbias. For in the church is some of Luca's most\\nexquisite work -- an altarpiece with a frieze of aerial angels under it,\\nand a stately white saint on either side, and the loveliest decorated\\ncolumns imaginable; while in an adjoining chapel is a Christ crucified\\nmourned by the most dignified and melancholy of Magdalens. Andrea della\\nRobbia is here too, and here also is a richly designed cantoria by Mino\\nda Fiesole. The village is not in the regular programme of visitors,\\nand Baedeker ignores it; hence perhaps the excitement which an arrival\\nfrom Florence causes, for the children turn out in battalions. The\\nchurch is very dirty, and so indeed is everything else; but no amount\\nof grime can disguise the charm of the cloisters.\\n\\nThe Certosa is a mere half-hour from Florence, Impruneta an hour\\nand a half; but Vallombrosa asks a long day. One can go by rail,\\nchanging at Sant' Ellero into the expensive rack-and-pinion car which\\nclimbs through the vineyards to a point near the summit, and has,\\nsince it was opened, brought to the mountain so many new residents,\\nwhose little villas cling to the western slopes among the lizards,\\nand, in summer, are smitten unbearably by the sun. But the best way\\nto visit the monastery and the groves is by road. A motor-car no\\ndoubt makes little of the journey; but a carriage and pair such as I\\nchartered at Florence for forty-five lire has to be away before seven,\\nand, allowing three hours on the top, is not back again until the\\nsame hour in the evening; and this, the ancient way, with the beat\\nof eight hoofs in one's ears, is the right way.\\n\\nFor several miles the road and the river -- the Arno -- run side by\\nside -- and the railway close by too -- through venerable villages whose\\ninhabitants derive their living either from the soil or the water,\\nand amid vineyards all the time. Here and there a white villa is seen,\\nbut for the most part this is peasants' district: one such villa\\non the left, before Pontassieve, having about it, and on each side\\nof its drive, such cypresses as one seldom sees and only Gozzoli or\\nMr. Sargent could rightly paint, each in his own style. Not far beyond,\\nin a scrap of meadow by the road, sat a girl knitting in the morning\\nsun -- with a placid glance at us as we rattled by; and ten hours later,\\nwhen we rattled past again, there she still was, still knitting, in\\nthe evening sun, and again her quiet eyes were just raised and dropped.\\n\\nAt Pontassieve we stopped a while for coffee at an inn at the corner\\nof the square of pollarded limes, and while it was preparing watched\\nthe little crumbling town at work, particularly the cooper opposite,\\nwho was finishing a massive cask within whose recesses good Chianti\\nis doubtless now maturing; and then on the white road again, to the\\nturning, a mile farther on, to the left, where one bids the Arno\\nfarewell till the late afternoon. Steady climbing now, and then a\\nturn to the right and we see Pelago before us, perched on its crags,\\nand by and by come to it -- a tiny town, with a clean and alluring\\ninn, very different from the squalor of Pontassieve: famous in art\\nand particularly Florentine art as being the birthplace of Lorenzo\\nGhiberti, who made the Baptistery doors. From Pelago the road descends\\nwith extreme steepness to a brook in a rocky valley, at a bridge over\\nwhich the real climb begins, to go steadily on (save for another swift\\ndrop before Tosi) until Vallombrosa is reached, winding through woods\\nall the way, chiefly chestnut -- those woods which gave Milton, who was\\nhere in 1638, his famous simile. The heat was now becoming intense\\n(it was mid-September) and the horses were suffering, and most of this\\nlast stage was done at walking pace; but such was the exhilaration of\\nthe air, such the delight of the aromas which the breeze continually\\nwafted from the woods, now sweet, now pungent, and always refreshing,\\nthat one felt no fatigue even though walking too. And so at last the\\nmonastery, and what was at that moment better than anything, lunch.\\n\\nThe beauty and joy of Vallombrosa, I may say at once, are Nature's,\\nnot man's. The monastery, which is now a Government school of\\nforestry, is ugly and unkempt; the hotel is unattractive; the few\\npeople one meets want to sell something or take you for a drive. But\\nin an instant in any direction one can be in the woods -- and at this\\nlevel they are pine woods, soft underfoot and richly perfumed -- and\\na quarter of an hour's walking brings the view. It is then that you\\nrealize you are on a mountain indeed. Florence is to the north-west\\nin the long Arno valley, which is here precipitous and narrow. The\\nriver is far below -- if you slipped you would slide into it -- fed by\\ntumbling Apennine streams from both walls. The top of the mountain\\nis heathery like Scotland, and open; but not long will it be so,\\nfor everywhere are the fenced parallelograms which indicate that a\\nvilla is to be erected. Nothing, however, can change the mountain\\nair or the glory of the surrounding heights.\\n\\nAnother view, unbroken by villas but including the monastery and the\\nForesters' Hotel in the immediate foreground, and extending as far as\\nFlorence itself (on suitable days), is obtained from Il Paradisino,\\na white building on a ledge which one sees from the hotel above the\\nmonastery. But that is not by any means the top. The view covers much\\nof the way by which we came hither.\\n\\nOf the monastery of Vallombrosa we have had foreshadowings in\\nFlorence. We saw at the Accademia two exquisite portraits by Fra\\nBartolommeo of Vallombrosan monks. We saw at the Bargello the remains\\nof a wonderful frieze by Benedetto da Rovezzano for the tomb of\\nthe founder of the order, S. Giovanni Gualberto; we shall see at\\nS. Miniato scenes in the saint's life on the site of the ancient\\nchapel where the crucifix bent and blessed him. As the head of the\\nmonastery Gualberto was famous for the severity and thoroughness of\\nhis discipline. But though a martinet as an abbot, personally he was\\nhumble and mild. His advice on all kinds of matters is said to have\\nbeen invited even by kings and popes. He invented the system of lay\\nbrothers to help with the domestic work of the convent; and after a\\nlife of holiness, which comprised several miracles, he died in 1073\\nand was subsequently canonized.\\n\\nThe monastery, as I have said, is now secularized, save for the chapel,\\nwhere three resident monks perform service. One may wander through its\\nrooms and see in the refectory, beneath portraits of famous brothers,\\nthe tables now laid for young foresters. The museum of forestry is\\ninteresting to those interested in museums of forestry.\\n\\nIt was to the monastery at Vallombrosa that the Brownings travelled\\nin 1848 when Mrs. Browning was ill. But the abbot could not break the\\nrules in regard to women, and after five days they had to return to\\nFlorence. Browning used to play the organ in the chapel, as, it is\\nsaid, Milton had done two centuries earlier.\\n\\nAt such a height and with only a short season the hotel proprietors\\nmust do what they can, and prices do not rule low. A departing American\\nwas eyeing his bill with a rueful glance as we were leaving. \\\"Milton\\nhad it wrong,\\\" he said to me (with the freemasonry of the plucked,\\nfor I knew him not), \\\"what he meant was, 'thick as thieves'.\\\"\\n\\nWe returned by way of Sant' Ellero, the gallant horses trotting\\nsteadily down the hill, and then beside the Arno once more all the\\nway to Florence. It chanced to be a great day in the city -- September\\n20th, the anniversary of the final defeat of papal temporal power,\\nin 1870 -- which we were not sorry to have missed, the first tidings\\ncoming to us from the beautiful tower of the Palazzo Vecchio which\\nin honour of the occasion had been picked out with fairy lamps.\\n\\nAmong the excursions which I think ought to be made if one is in\\nFlorence for a justifying length of time is a visit to Prato. This\\nancient town one should see for several things: for its age and for\\nits walls; for its great piazza (with a pile of vividly dyed yarn\\nin the midst) surrounded by arches under which coppersmiths hammer\\nall day at shining rotund vessels, while their wives plait straw;\\nfor Filippino Lippi's exquisite Madonna in a little mural shrine at\\nthe narrow end of the piazza, which a woman (fetched by a crowd of\\nragged boys) will unlock for threepence; and for the cathedral, with\\nFilippino's dissolute father's frescoes in it, the Salome being one\\nof the most interesting pre-Botticelli scenes in Italian art. If only\\nit had its colour what a wonder of lightness and beauty this still\\nwould be! But probably most people are attracted to Prato chiefly by\\nDonatello and Michelozzo's outdoor pulpit, the frieze of which is a\\nkind of prentice work for the famous cantoria in the museum of the\\ncathedral at Florence, with just such wanton boys dancing round it.\\n\\nOn Good Friday evening in the lovely dying April light I paid\\nthirty centimes to be taken by tram to Grassina to see the famous\\nprocession of the Ges\\u00f9 Morto. The number of people on the same\\nerrand having thrown out the tram service, we had very long waits,\\nwhile the road was thronged with other vehicles; and the result was\\nI was tired enough -- having been standing all the way -- when Grassina\\nwas reached, for festivals six miles out of Florence at seven in the\\nevening disarrange good habits. But a few pence spent in the albergo\\non bread and cheese and wine soon restored me. A queer cavern of a\\nplace, this inn, with rough tables, rows and rows of wine flasks,\\nand an open fire behind the bar, tended by an old woman, from which\\neverything good to eat proceeded rapidly without dismay -- roast chicken\\nand fish in particular. A strapping girl with high cheek bones and a\\nbroad dark comely face washed plates and glasses assiduously, and two\\nwaiters, with eyes as near together as monkeys', served the customers\\nwith bewildering intelligence. It was the sort of inn that in England\\nwould throw up its hands if you asked even for cold beef.\\n\\nThe piazza of Grassina, which, although merely a village, is\\nenterprising enough to have a cinematoscope hall, was full of\\nstalls given chiefly to the preparation and sale of cake like the\\nDutch wafelen, and among the stalls were conjurors, cheap-jacks,\\nsingers, and dice throwers; while every moment brought its fresh\\nmotor-car or carriage load, nearly all speaking English with a nasal\\ntwang. Meanwhile every one shouted, the naphtha flared, the drums beat,\\nthe horses champed. The street was full too, chiefly of peasants,\\nbut among them myriad resolute American virgins, in motor veils, whom\\nnothing can ever surprise; a few American men, sceptical, as ever,\\nof anything ever happening; here and there a diffident Englishwoman\\nand Englishman, more in the background, but destined in the end\\nto see all. But what I chiefly noticed was the native girls, with\\ntheir proud bosoms carried high and nothing on their heads. They at\\nany rate know their own future. No rushing over the globe for them,\\nbut the simple natural home life and children.\\n\\nIn the gloom the younger girls in white muslin were like pretty\\nghosts, each followed by a solicitous mother giving a touch here\\nand a touch there -- mothers who once wore muslin too, will wear it no\\nmore, and are now happy in pride in their daughters. And very little\\ngirls too -- mere tots -- wearing wings, who very soon were to join the\\nprocession as angels.\\n\\nAnd all the while the darkness was growing, and on the hill where the\\nchurch stands lights were beginning to move about, in that mysterious\\nway which torches have when a procession is being mobilized, while\\nall the villas on the hills around had their rows of candles.\\n\\nAnd then the shifting flames came gradually into a mass and took\\na steady upward progress, and the melancholy strains of an ancient\\necclesiastical lamentation reached our listening ears. As the lights\\ndrew nearer I left the bank where all the Mamies and Sadies with\\ntheir Mommas were stationed and walked down into the river valley\\nto meet the vanguard. On the bridge I found a little band of Roman\\nsoldiers on horseback, without stirrups, and had a few words with\\none of them as to his anachronistic cigarette, and then the first\\ntorches arrived, carried by proud little boys in red; and after the\\ntorches the little girls in muslin veils, which were, however, for\\nthe most part disarranged for the better recognition of relations\\nand even more perhaps for recognition by relations: and very pretty\\nthis recognition was on both sides. And then the village priests in\\nfull canonicals, looking a little self-conscious; and after them the\\ndead Christ on a litter carried by a dozen contadini who had a good\\ndeal to say to each other as they bore Him.\\n\\nThis was the same dead Christ which had been lying in state in the\\nchurch, for the past few days, to be worshipped and kissed by the\\npeasantry. I had seen a similar image at Settignano the day before and\\nhad watched how the men took it. They began by standing in groups in\\nthe piazza, gossipping. Then two or three would break away and make\\nfor the church. There, all among the women and children, half-shyly,\\nhalf-defiantly, they pecked at the plaster flesh and returned to resume\\nthe conversation in the piazza with a new serenity and confidence in\\ntheir hearts.\\n\\nAfter the dead Christ came a triumphal car of the very little girls\\nwith wings, signifying I know not what, but intensely satisfying to\\nthe onlookers. One little wet-nosed cherub I patted, so chubby and\\ninnocent she was; and Heaven send that the impulse profited me! This\\ncar was drawn by an ancient white horse, amiable and tractable as a\\nsaint, but as bewildered as I as to the meaning of the whole strange\\nbusiness. After the car of angels a stalwart body of white-vestmented\\nsingers, sturdy fellows with black moustaches who had been all day\\namong the vines, or steering placid white oxen through the furrows,\\nand were now lifting their voices in a miserere. And after them the\\npainted plaster Virgin, carried as upright as possible, and then\\nmore torches and the wailing band; and after the band another guard\\nof Roman soldiers.\\n\\nSuch was the Grassina procession. It passed slowly and solemnly through\\nthe town from the hill and up the hill again; and not soon shall I\\nforget the mournfulness of the music, which nothing of tawdriness in\\nthe constituents of the procession itself could rid of impressiveness\\nand beauty. One thing is certain -- all processions, by day or night,\\nshould first descend a hill and then ascend one. All should walk to\\nmelancholy strains. Indeed, a joyful procession becomes an impossible\\nthought after this.\\n\\nAnd then I sank luxuriously into a corner seat in the waiting tram,\\nand, seeking for the return journey's thirty centimes, found that\\nduring the proceedings my purse had been stolen.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nS. Marco\\n\\nAndrea del Castagno -- \\\"The Last Supper\\\" -- The stolen Madonna -- Fra\\nAngelico's frescoes -- \\\"Little Antony\\\" -- The good archbishop -- The\\nBuonuomini -- Savonarola -- The death of Lorenzo the Magnificent -- Pope\\nAlexander VI -- The Ordeal by Fire -- The execution -- The S. Marco\\ncells -- The cloister frescoes -- Ghirlandaio's \\\"Last Supper\\\" -- Relics of\\nold Florence -- Pico and Politian -- Piero di Cosimo -- Andrea del Sarto.\\n\\nFrom the Accademia it is but a step to S. Marco, across the Piazza, but\\nit is well first to go a little beyond that in order to see a certain\\npainting which both chronologically and as an influence comes before\\na painting that we shall find in the Museo S. Marco. We therefore\\ncross the Piazza S. Marco to the Via d'Arrazzieri, which leads into\\nthe Via 27 Aprile, where at a door on the left, marked A, is an\\nancient refectory, preserved as a picture gallery: the Cenacolo di\\nS. Apollonia, all that is kept sacred of the monastery of S. Apollonia,\\nnow a military establishment. This room is important to students of\\nart in containing so much work of Andrea del Castagno (1390-1457),\\nto whom Vasari gives so black a character. The portrait frescoes are\\nfrom the Villa Pandolfini (previously Carducci), and among them are\\nBoccaccio, Petrarch, and Dante -- who is here rather less ascetic than\\nusual -- none of whom the painter could have seen. There is also a very\\ncharming little cupid carrying a huge peacock plume. But \\\"The Last\\nSupper\\\" is the glory of the room. This work, which belongs to the\\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, is interesting as a real effort at\\npsychology. Leonardo makes Judas leave his seat to ask if it is he\\nthat is meant -- that being the dramatic moment chosen by this prince\\nof painters: Castagno calls attention to Judas as an undesirable\\nmember of the little band of disciples by placing him apart, the\\nonly one on his side of the table; which was avoiding the real task,\\nsince naturally when one of the company was forced into so sinister\\na position the question would be already answered. Castagno indeed\\nrenders Judas so obviously untrustworthy as to make it a surprise\\nthat he ever was admitted among the disciples (or wished to be one)\\nat all; while Vasari blandly suggests that he is the very image of the\\npainter himself. Other positions which later artists converted into a\\nconvention may also be noted: John, for example, is reclining on the\\ntable in an ecstasy of affection and fidelity; while the Florentine\\nloggia as the scene of the meal was often reproduced later.\\n\\nAndrea del Castagno began life as a farm lad, but was educated as an\\nartist at the cost of one of the less notable Medici. He had a vigorous\\nway with his brush, as we see here and have seen elsewhere. In the\\nDuomo, for example, we saw his equestrian portrait of Niccol\\u00f2 da\\nTolentino, a companion to Uccello's Hawkwood. When the Albizzi and\\nPeruzzi intrigues which had led to the banishment of Cosimo de' Medici\\ncame to their final frustration with the triumphant return of Cosimo,\\nit was Andrea who was commissioned by the Signoria to paint for the\\noutside of the Bargello a picture of the leaders of the insurrection,\\nupside down. Vasari is less to be trusted in his dates and facts in his\\nmemoir of Andrea del Castagno than anywhere else; for he states that\\nhe commemorated the failure of the Pazzi Conspiracy (which occurred\\ntwenty years after his death), and accuses him not only of murdering\\nhis fellow-painter Domenico Veneziano but confessing to the crime;\\nthe best answer to which allegation is that Domenico survived Andrea\\nby four years.\\n\\nWe may now return to S. Marco. The convent as we now see it was\\nbuilt by Michelozzo, Donatello's friend and partner and the friend\\nalso of Cosimo de' Medici, at whose cost he worked here. Antonino,\\nthe saintly head of the monastery, having suggested to Cosimo that\\nhe should apply some of his wealth, not always too nicely obtained,\\nto the Lord, Cosimo began literally to squander money on S. Marco,\\ndividing his affection between S. Lorenzo, which he completed upon\\nthe lines laid down by his father, and this Dominican monastery,\\nwhere he even had a cell reserved for his own use, with a bedroom\\nin addition, whither he might now and again retire for spiritual\\nrefreshment and quiet.\\n\\nIt was at S. Marco that Cosimo kept the MSS. which he was constantly\\ncollecting, and which now, after curious vicissitudes, are lodged\\nin Michelangelo's library at S. Lorenzo; and on his death he left\\nthem to the monks. Cosimo's librarian was Tommaso Parenticelli, a\\nlittle busy man, who, to the general astonishment, on the death of\\nEugenius IV became Pope and took the name of Nicholas V. His energies\\nas Pontiff went rather towards learning and art than anything else: he\\nlaid the foundations of the Vatican library, on the model of Cosimo's,\\nand persuaded Fra Angelico to Rome to paint Vatican frescoes.\\n\\nThe magnets which draw every one who visits Florence to S. Marco are\\nfirst Fra Angelico, and secondly Savonarola, or first Savonarola, and\\nsecondly Fra Angelico, according as one is constituted. Fra Angelico,\\nat Cosimo's desire and cost, came from Fiesole to paint here; while\\nGirolamo Savonarola, forced to leave Ferrara during the war, entered\\nthese walls in 1482. Fra Angelico in his single crucifixion picture in\\nthe first cloisters and in his great scene of the Mount of Olives in\\nthe chapter house shows himself less incapable of depicting unhappiness\\nthan we have yet seen him; but the most memorable of the ground-floor\\nfrescoes is the symbol of hospitality over the door of the wayfarers'\\nroom, where Christ is being welcomed by two Dominicans in the way\\nthat Dominicans (as contrasted with scoundrelly Franciscans) would of\\ncourse welcome Him. In this Ospizio are three reliquaries which Fra\\nAngelico painted for S. Maria Novella, now preserved here in a glass\\ncase. They represent the Madonna della Stella, the Coronation of the\\nVirgin, and the Adoration of the Magi. All are in Angelico's happiest\\nmanner, with plenty of gold; and the predella of the Coronation is\\nthe prettiest thing possible, with its blue saints gathered about a\\nblue Mary and Joseph, who bend over the Baby.\\n\\nThe Madonna della Stella is the picture which was stolen in 1911, but\\nquickly recovered. It is part of the strange complexity of this world\\nthat it should equally contain artists such as Fra Angelico and thieves\\nsuch as those who planned and carried out this robbery: nominally\\ncustodians of the museum. To repeat one of Vasari's sentences: \\\"Some\\nsay that he never took up his brush without first making a prayer\\\"....\\n\\nThe \\\"Peter\\\" with his finger to his lips, over the sacristy, is\\nreminding the monks that that room is vowed to silence. In the chapter\\nhouse is the large Crucifixion by the same gentle hand, his greatest\\nwork in Florence, and very fine and true in character. Beneath it\\nare portraits of seventeen famous Dominicans with S. Dominic in\\nthe midst. Note the girl with the scroll in the right -- how gay and\\nlight the colouring. Upstairs, in the cells, and pre-eminently in the\\npassage, where his best known Annunciation is to be seen, Angelico is\\nat his best. In each cell is a little fresco reminding the brother\\nof the life of Christ -- and of those by Angelico it may be said that\\neach is as simple as it can be and as sweet: easy lines, easy colours,\\nwith the very spirit of holiness shining out. I think perhaps that the\\nCoronation of the Virgin in the ninth cell, reproduced in this volume,\\nis my favourite, as it is of many persons; but the Annunciation in the\\nthird, the two Maries at the Sepulchre in the eighth, and the Child\\nin the Stable in the fifth, are ever memorable too. In the cell set\\napart for Cosimo de' Medici, No. 38, which the officials point out,\\nis an Adoration of the Magi, painted there at Cosimo's express wish,\\nthat he might be reminded of the humility proper to rulers; and here\\nwe get one of the infrequent glimpses of this best and wisest of the\\nMedici, for a portrait of him adorns it, with a wrong death-date on it.\\n\\nHere also is a sensitive terra-cotta bust of S. Antonio, Cosimo's\\nfriend and another pride of the monastery: the monk who was also\\nArchbishop of Florence until his death, and whom we saw, in stone, in\\na niche under the Uffizi. His cell was the thirty-first cell, opposite\\nthe entrance. This benign old man, who has one of the kindest faces\\nof his time, which was often introduced into pictures, was appointed\\nto the see at the suggestion of Fra Angelico, to whom Pope Eugenius\\n(who consecrated the new S. Marco in 1442 and occupied Cosimo de'\\nMedici's cell on his visit) had offered it; but the painter declined\\nand put forward Antonio in his stead. Antonio Pierozzi, whose destiny\\nit was to occupy this high post, to be a confidant of Cosimo de'\\nMedici, and ultimately, in 1523, to be enrolled among the saints,\\nwas born at Florence in 1389. According to Butler, from the cradle\\n\\\"Antonino\\\" or \\\"Little Antony,\\\" as the Florentines affectionately\\ncalled him, had \\\"no inclination but to piety,\\\" and was an enemy even\\nas an infant \\\"both to sloth and to the amusements of children\\\". As\\na schoolboy his only pleasure was to read the lives of the saints,\\nconverse with pious persons or to pray. When not at home or at school\\nhe was in church, either kneeling or lying prostrate before a crucifix,\\n\\\"with a perseverance that astonished everybody\\\". S. Dominic himself,\\npreaching at Fiesole, made him a Dominican, his answers to an\\nexamination of the whole decree of Gratian being the deciding cause,\\nalthough Little Antony was then but sixteen. As a priest he was\\n\\\"never seen at the altar but bathed in tears\\\". After being prior of\\na number of convents and a counsellor of much weight in convocation,\\nhe was made Archbishop of Florence: but was so anxious to avoid the\\nhonour and responsibility that he hid in the island of Sardinia. On\\nbeing discovered he wrote a letter praying to be excused and watered it\\nwith his tears; but at last he consented and was consecrated in 1446.\\n\\nAs archbishop his life was a model of simplicity and solicitude. He\\nthought only of his duties and the well-being of the poor. His purse\\nwas open to all in need, and he \\\"often sold\\\" his single mule in order\\nto relieve some necessitous person. He gave up his garden to the growth\\nof vegetables for the poor, and kept an ungrateful leper whose sores\\nhe dressed with his own hands. He died in 1459 and was canonized in\\n1523. His body was still free from corruption in 1559, when it was\\ntranslated to the chapel in S. Marco prepared for it by the Salviati.\\n\\nBut perhaps the good Antonino's finest work was the foundation of a\\nphilanthropic society of Florentines which still carries on its good\\nwork. Antonino's sympathy lay in particular with the reduced families\\nof Florence, and it was to bring help secretly to them -- too proud to\\nbeg -- that he called for volunteers. The society was known in the city\\nas the Buonuomini (good men) of S. Martino, the little church close to\\nDante's house, behind the Badia: S. Martin being famous among saints\\nfor his impulsive yet wise generosity with his cloak.\\n\\nThe other and most famous prior of S. Marco was Savonarola. Girolamo\\nSavonarola was born of noble family at Ferrara in 1452, and after a\\nprofound education, in which he concentrated chiefly upon religion and\\nphilosophy, he entered the Dominican order at the age of twenty-two. He\\nfirst came to S. Marco at the age of thirty and preached there in\\nLent in 1482, but without attracting much notice. When, however, he\\nreturned to S. Marco seven years later it was to be instantly hailed\\nboth as a powerful preacher and reformer. His eloquent and burning\\ndeclarations were hurled both at Florence and Rome: at the apathy and\\ngreed of the Church as a whole, and at the sinfulness and luxury of\\nthis city, while Lorenzo the Magnificent, who was then at the height\\nof his influence, surrounded by accomplished and witty hedonists,\\nand happiest when adding to his collection of pictures, jewels,\\nand sculpture, in particular did the priest rebuke. Savonarola stood\\nfor the spiritual ideals and asceticism of the Baptist, Christ, and\\nS. Paul; Lorenzo, in his eyes, made only for sensuality and decadence.\\n\\nThe two men, however, recognized each other's genius, and Lorenzo,\\nwith the tolerance which was as much a mark of the first three\\nMedici rulers as its absence was notable in most of the later ones,\\nrather encouraged Savonarola in his crusade than not. He visited him\\nin the monastery and did not resent being kept waiting; and he went\\nto hear him preach. In 1492 Lorenzo died, sending for Savonarola on\\nhis death-bed, which was watched by the two closest of his scholarly\\nfriends, Pico della Mirandola and Politian. The story of what happened\\nhas been variously told. According to the account of Politian, Lorenzo\\nmet his end with fortitude, and Savonarola prayed with the dying man\\nand gave him his blessing; according to another account, Lorenzo was\\ncalled upon by Savonarola to make three undertakings before he died,\\nand, Lorenzo declining, Savonarola left him unabsolved. These promises\\nwere (1) to repent of all his sins, and in particular of the sack\\nof Volterra, of the alleged theft of public dowry funds and of the\\nimplacable punishment of the Pazzi conspirators; (2) to restore all\\nproperty of which he had become possessed by unjust means; and (3)\\nto give back to Florence her liberty. But the probabilities are in\\nfavour of Politian's account being the true one, and the later story\\na political invention.\\n\\nLorenzo dead and Piero his son so incapable, Savonarola came to his\\nown. He had long foreseen a revolution following on the death of\\nLorenzo, and in one of his most powerful sermons he had suggested\\nthat the \\\"Flagellum Dei\\\" to punish the wicked Florentines might be\\na foreign invader. When therefore in 1493 the French king Charles\\nVIII arrived in Italy with his army, Savonarola was recognized not\\nonly as a teacher but as a prophet; and when the Medici had been\\nagain banished and Charles, having asked too much, had retreated\\nfrom Florence, the Republic was remodelled with Savonarola virtually\\ncontrolling its Great Council. For a year or two his power was supreme.\\n\\nThis was the period of the Piagnoni, or Weepers. The citizens adopted\\nsober attire; a spirit as of England under the Puritans prevailed;\\nand Savonarola's eloquence so far carried away not only the populace\\nbut many persons of genius that a bonfire was lighted in the middle\\nof the Piazza della Signoria in which costly dresses, jewels, false\\nhair and studies from the nude were destroyed.\\n\\nSavonarola, meanwhile, was not only chastising and reforming Florence,\\nbut with fatal audacity was attacking with even less mincing of words\\nthe licentiousness of the Pope. As to the character of Lorenzo de'\\nMedici there can be two opinions, and indeed the historians of Florence\\nare widely divided in their estimates; but of Roderigo Borgia (Pope\\nAlexander VI) there is but one, and Savonarola held it. Savonarola\\nwas excommunicated, but refused to obey the edict. Popes, however,\\nalthough Florence had to a large extent put itself out of reach,\\nhave long arms, and gradually -- taking advantage of the city's growing\\ndiscontent with piety and tears and recurring unquiet, there being\\nstill a strong pro-Medici party, and building not a little on his\\nknowledge of the Florentine love of change -- the Pope gathered together\\nsufficient supporters of his determination to crush this too outspoken\\ncritic and humiliate his fellow-citizens.\\n\\nEvents helped the pontiff. A pro-Medici conspiracy excited the\\npopulace; a second bonfire of vanities led to rioting, for the\\nFlorentines were beginning to tire of virtue; and the preaching of a\\nFranciscan monk against Savonarola (and the gentle Fra Angelico has\\nshown us, in the Accademia, how Franciscans and Dominicans could hate\\neach other) brought matters to a head, for he challenged Savaronola\\nto an ordeal by fire in the Loggia de' Lanzi, to test which of them\\nspoke with the real voice of God. A Dominican volunteered to make the\\nessay with a Franciscan. This ceremony, anticipated with the liveliest\\neagerness by the Florentines, was at the last moment forbidden,\\nand Savonarola, who had to bear the responsibility of such a bitter\\ndisappointment to a pleasure-loving people, became an unpopular\\nfigure. Everything just then was against him, for Charles VIII,\\nwith whom he had an understanding and of whom the Pope was afraid,\\nchose that moment to die.\\n\\nThe Pope drove home his advantage, and getting more power among\\nindividuals on the Council forced them to indict their firebrand. No\\nmeans were spared, however base; forgery and false witness were as\\nnothing. The summons arrived on April 8th, 1497, when Savonarola was\\nat S. Marco. The monks, who adored him, refused to let him go, and\\nfor a whole day the convent was under siege. But might, of course,\\nprevailed, and Savonarola was dragged from the church to the Palazzo\\nVecchio and prosecuted for the offence of claiming to have supernatural\\npower and fomenting political disturbance. He was imprisoned in a tiny\\ncell in the tower for many days, and under constant torture he no doubt\\nuttered words which would never have passed his lips had he been in\\ncontrol of himself; but we may dismiss, as false, the evidence which\\nmakes them into confessions. Evidence there had to be, and evidence\\nnaturally was forthcoming; and sentence of death was passed.\\n\\nIn that cell, when not under torture, he managed to write meditations\\non the thirteenth psalm, \\\"In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped,\\\" and a little\\nwork entitled \\\"A Rule for Living a Christian Life\\\". Before the last\\nday he administered the Sacrament to his two companions, who were to\\ndie with him, with perfect composure, and the night preceding they\\nspent together in prayer in the Great Hall which he had once dominated.\\n\\nThe execution was on May 23rd, 1498. A gallows was erected in\\nthe Piazza della Signoria on the spot now marked by the bronze\\ntablet. Beneath the gallows was a bonfire. All those members of the\\nGovernment who could endure the scene were present, either on the\\nplatform of the Palazzo Vecchio or in the Loggia de' Lanzi. The crowd\\nfilled the Piazza. The three monks went to their death unafraid. When\\nhis friar's gown was taken from him, Savonarola said: \\\"Holy gown,\\nthou wert granted to me by God's grace and I have ever kept thee\\nunstained. Now I forsake thee not but am bereft of thee.\\\" (This very\\ngarment is in the glass case in Savonarola's cell at S. Marco.) The\\nBishop replied hastily: \\\"I separate thee from the Church militant\\nand triumphant\\\". \\\"Militant,\\\" replied Savonarola, \\\"not triumphant, for\\nthat rests not with you.\\\" The monks were first hanged and then burned.\\n\\nThe larger picture of the execution which hangs in Savonarola's\\ncell, although interesting and up to a point credible, is of course\\nnot right. The square must have been crowded: in fact we know it\\nwas. The picture has still other claims on the attention, for it\\nshows the Judith and Holofernes as the only statue before the Palazzo\\nVecchio, standing where David now is; it shows the old ringhiera,\\nthe Marzocco (very inaccurately drawn), and the Loggia de' Lanzi\\nempty of statuary. We have in the National Gallery a little portrait\\nof Savonarola -- No. 1301 -- with another representation of the execution\\non the back of it.\\n\\nSo far as I can understand Savonarola, his failure was due to\\ntwo causes: firstly, his fatal blending of religion and politics,\\nand secondly, the conviction which his temporary success with the\\nsusceptible Florentines bred in his heated mind that he was destined\\nto carry all before him, totally failing to appreciate the Florentine\\ncharacter with all its swift and deadly changes and love of change. As\\nI see it, Savonarola's special mission at that time was to be a\\nwandering preacher, spreading the light and exciting his listeners to\\nspiritual revival in this city and that, but never to be in a position\\nof political power and never to become rooted. The peculiar tragedy\\nof his career is that he left Florence no better than he found it:\\nindeed, very likely worse; for in a reaction from a spiritual revival\\na lower depth can be reached than if there had been no revival at all;\\nwhile the visit of the French army to Italy, for which Savonarola took\\nsuch credit to himself, merely ended in disaster for Italy, disease\\nfor Europe, and the spreading of the very Renaissance spirit which\\nhe had toiled to destroy. But, when all is said as to his tragedy,\\npersonal and political, there remains this magnificent isolated figure,\\nsingle-minded, austere and self-sacrificing, in an age of indulgence.\\n\\nFor most people \\\"Romola\\\" is the medium through which Savonarola is\\nvisualized; but there he is probably made too theatrical. Yet he\\nmust have had something of the theatre in him even to consent to the\\nordeal by fire. That he was an intense visionary is beyond doubt,\\nbut a very real man too we must believe when we read of the devotion\\nof his monks to his person, and of his success for a while with the\\nshrewd, worldly Great Council.\\n\\nSavonarola had many staunch friends among the artists. We have seen\\nLorenzo di Credi and Fra Bartolommeo under his influence. After\\nhis death Fra Bartolommeo entered S. Marco (his cell was No. 34),\\nand di Credi, who was noted for his clean living, entered S. Maria\\nNuova. Two of Luca della Robbia's nephews were also monks under\\nSavonarola. We have seen Fra Bartolommeo's portrait of Savonarola in\\nthe Accademia, and there is another of him here. Cronaca, who built\\nthe Great Council's hall, survived Savonarola only ten years, and\\nduring that time all his stories were of him. Michelangelo, who was\\na young man when he heard him preach, read his sermons to the end of\\nhis long life. But upon Botticelli his influence was most powerful,\\nfor he turned that master's hand from such pagan allegories as the\\n\\\"Primavera\\\" and the \\\"Birth of Venus\\\" wholly to religious subjects.\\n\\nSavonarola had three adjoining cells. In the first is a monument to\\nhim, his portrait by Fra Bartolommeo and three frescoes by the same\\nhand. In the next room is the glass case containing his robe, his\\nhair shirt, and rosary; and here also are his desk and some books. In\\nthe bedroom is a crucifixion by Fra Angelico on linen. No one knowing\\nSavonarola's story can remain here unmoved.\\n\\nWe find Fra Bartolommeo again with a pencil drawing of S. Antonio\\nin that saint's cell. Here also is Antonino's death-mask. The\\nterra-cotta bust of him in Cosimo's cell is the most like life, but\\nthere is an excellent and vivacious bronze in the right transept of\\nS. Maria Novella.\\n\\nBefore passing downstairs again the library should be visited, that\\ndelightful assemblage of grey pillars and arches. Without its desks\\nand cases it would be one of the most beautiful rooms in Florence. All\\nthe books have gone, save the illuminated music.\\n\\nIn the first cloisters, which are more liveable-in than the ordinary\\nFlorentine cloisters, having a great shady tree in the midst with a\\nseat round it, and flowers, are the Fra Angelicos I have mentioned. The\\nother painting is rather theatrical and poor. In the refectory is\\na large scene of the miracle of the Providenza, when S. Dominic and\\nhis companions, during a famine, were fed by two angels with bread;\\nwhile at the back S. Antonio watches the crucified Christ. The artist\\nis Sogliano.\\n\\nIn addition to Fra Angelico's great crucifixion fresco in the chapter\\nhouse, is a single Christ crucified, with a monk mourning, by Antonio\\nPollaiuolo, very like the Fra Angelico in the cloisters; but the\\ncolour has left it, and what must have been some noble cypresses are\\nnow ghosts dimly visible. The frame is superb.\\n\\nOne other painting we must see -- the \\\"Last Supper\\\" of Domenico\\nGhirlandaio. Florence has two \\\"Last Suppers\\\" by this artist -- one at\\nthe Ognissanti and this. The two works are very similar and have much\\nentertaining interest, but the debt which this owes to Castagno is very\\nobvious: it is indeed Castagno sweetened. Although psychologically this\\npicture is weak, or at any rate not strong, it is full of pleasant\\ntouches: the supper really is a supper, as it too often is not,\\nwith fruit and dishes and a generous number of flasks; the tablecloth\\nwould delight a good housekeeper; a cat sits close to Judas, his only\\ncompanion; a peacock perches in a niche; there are flowers on the wall,\\nand at the back of the charming loggia where the feast is held are\\nluxuriant trees, and fruits, and flying birds. The monks at food in\\nthis small refectory had compensation for their silence in so engaging\\na scene. This room also contains a beautiful della Robbia \\\"Deposition\\\".\\n\\nThe little refectory, which is at the foot of the stairs leading to\\nthe cells, opens on the second cloisters, and these few visitors ever\\nenter. But they are of deep interest to any one with a passion for\\nthe Florence of the great days, for it is here that the municipality\\npreserves the most remarkable relics of buildings that have had to\\nbe destroyed. It is in fact the museum of the ancient city. Here,\\nfor example, is that famous figure of Abundance, in grey stone,\\nwhich Donatello made for the old market, where the Piazza Vittorio\\nEmmanuele now is, in the midst of which she poured forth her fruits\\nfrom a cornucopia high on a column for all to see. Opposite is a\\nmagnificent doorway designed by Donatello for the Pazzi garden. Old\\nwindows, chimney-pieces, fragments of cornice, carved pillars,\\npainted beams, coats of arms, are everywhere.\\n\\nIn cell No. 3 is a pretty little coloured relief of the Virgin\\nadoring, which I covet, from a tabernacle in the old Piazza di\\nBrunelleschi. Here too are relics of the guild houses of some of\\nthe smaller Arti, while perhaps the most humanly interesting thing\\nof all is the great mournful bell of S. Marco in Savonarola's time,\\nknown as La Piagnone.\\n\\nIn the church of S. Marco lie two of the learned men, friends of\\nLorenzo de' Medici, whose talk at the Medici table was one of the\\nyouthful Michelangelo's educative influences, what time he was studying\\nin the Medici garden, close by: Angelo Poliziano (1454-1494), the\\npoet and the tutor of the three Medici boys, and the marvellous Pico\\ndella Mirandola (1463-1494), the enchanted scholar. Pico was one of the\\nmost fascinating and comely figures of his time. He was born in 1463,\\nthe son of the Count of Mirandola, and took early to scholarship,\\nspending his time among philosophies as other boys among games or\\nS. Antonio at his devotions, but by no means neglecting polished life\\ntoo, for we know him to have been handsome, accomplished, and a knight\\nin the court of Venus. In 1486 he challenged the whole world to meet\\nhim in Rome and dispute publicly upon nine hundred theses; but so\\nmany of them seemed likely to be paradoxes against the true faith,\\ntoo brilliantly defended, that the Pope forbade the contest. Pico\\ndabbled in the black arts, wrote learnedly (in his room at the Badia\\nof Fiesole) on the Mosaic law, was an amorous poet in Italian as well\\nas a serious poet in Latin, and in everything he did was interesting\\nand curious, steeped in Renaissance culture, and inspired by the wish\\nto reconcile the past and the present and humanize Christ and the\\nFathers. He found time also to travel much, and he gave most of his\\nfortune to establish a fund to provide penniless girls with marriage\\nportions. He had enough imagination to be the close friend both of\\nLorenzo de' Medici and Savonarola. Savonarola clothed his dead body\\nin Dominican robes and made him posthumously one of the order which\\nfor some time before his death he had desired to join. He died in\\n1494 at the early age of thirty-one, two years after Lorenzo.\\n\\nAngelo Poliziano, known as Politian, was also a Renaissance scholar\\nand also a friend of Lorenzo, and his companion, with Pico, at\\nhis death-bed; but although in precocity, brilliancy of gifts,\\nand literary charm he may be classed with Pico, the comparison\\nthere ends, for he was a gross sensualist of mean exterior and\\ncapable of much pettiness. He was tutor to Lorenzo's sons until\\ntheir mother interfered, holding that his views were far too loose,\\nbut while in that capacity he taught also Michelangelo and put him\\nupon the designing of his relief of the battle of the Lapithae and\\nCentaurs. At the time of Lorenzo and Giuliano's famous tournament\\nin the Piazza of S. Croce, Poliziano wrote, as I have said, the\\ndescriptive allegorical poem which gave Botticelli ideas for his\\n\\\"Birth of Venus\\\" and \\\"Primavera\\\". He lives chiefly by his Latin poems;\\nbut he did much to make the language of Tuscany a literary tongue. His\\nelegy on the death of Lorenzo has real feeling in it and proves him to\\nhave esteemed that friend and patron. Like Pico, he survived Lorenzo\\nonly two years, and he also was buried in Dominican robes. Perhaps\\nthe finest feat of Poliziano's life was his action in slamming the\\nsacristy doors in the face of Lorenzo's pursuers on that fatal day\\nin the Duomo when Giuliano de' Medici was stabbed.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's fresco in S. Trinit\\u00e0 of the granting of the charter\\nto S. Francis gives portraits both of Poliziano and Lorenzo in the\\nyear 1485. Lorenzo stands in a little group of four in the right-hand\\ncorner, holding out his hand towards Poliziano, who, with Lorenzo's\\nson Giuliano on his right and followed by two other boys, is advancing\\nup the steps. Poliziano is seen again in a Ghirlandaio fresco at\\nS. Maria Novella.\\n\\nFrom S. Marco we are going to SS. Annunziata, but first let us just\\ntake a few steps down the Via Cavour, in order to pass the Casino\\nMedici, since it is built on the site of the old Medici garden where\\nLorenzo de' Medici established Bertoldo, the sculptor, as head of a\\nschool of instruction, amid those beautiful antiques which we have\\nseen in the Uffizi, and where the boy Michelangelo was a student.\\n\\nA few steps farther on the left, towards the Fiesole heights, which\\nwe can see rising at the end of the street, we come, at No. 69, to a\\nlittle doorway which leads to a little courtyard -- the Chiostro dello\\nScalzo -- decorated with frescoes by Andrea del Sarto and Franciabigio\\nand containing the earliest work of both artists. The frescoes are in\\nmonochrome, which is very unusual, but their interest is not impaired\\nthereby: one does not miss other colours. No. 7, the Baptism of Christ,\\nis the first fresco these two associates ever did; and several years\\nelapsed between that and the best that are here, such as the group\\nrepresenting Charity and the figure of Faith, for the work was long\\ninterrupted. The boys on the staircase in the fresco which shows\\nS. John leaving his father's house are very much alive. This is by\\nFranciabigio, as is also S. John meeting with Christ, a very charming\\nscene. Andrea's best and latest is the Birth of the Baptist, which\\nhas the fine figure of Zacharias writing in it. But what he should\\nbe writing at that time and place one cannot imagine: more reasonably\\nmight he be called a physician preparing a prescription. On the wall\\nis a terra-cotta bust of S. Antonio, making him much younger than\\nis usual.\\n\\nAndrea's suave brush we find all over Florence, both in fresco and\\npicture, and this is an excellent place to say something of the man\\nof whom English people have perhaps a more intimate impression than\\nof any other of the old masters, by reason largely of Browning's\\npoem and not a little by that beautiful portrait which for so long\\nwas erroneously considered to represent the painter himself, in our\\nNational Gallery. Andrea's life was not very happy. No painter had\\nmore honour in his own day, and none had a greater number of pupils,\\nbut these stopped with him only a short time, owing to the demeanour\\ntowards them of Andrea's wife, who developed into a flirt and shrew,\\ndowered with a thousand jealousies. Andrea, the son of a tailor, was\\nborn in 1486 and apprenticed to a goldsmith. Showing, however, more\\ndrawing than designing ability, he was transferred to a painter named\\nBarile and then passed to that curious man of genius who painted the\\nfascinating picture \\\"The Death of Procris\\\" which hangs near Andrea's\\nportrait in our National Gallery -- Piero di Cosimo. Piero carried\\noddity to strange lengths. He lived alone in indescribable dirt,\\nand lived wholly on hard-boiled eggs, which he cooked, with his glue,\\nby the fifty, and ate as he felt inclined. He forbade all pruning of\\ntrees as an act of insubordination to Nature, and delighted in rain\\nbut cowered in terror from thunder and lightning. He peered curiously\\nat clouds to find strange shapes in them, and in his pursuit of the\\ngrotesque examined the spittle of sick persons on the walls or ground,\\nhoping for suggestions of monsters, combats of horses, or fantastic\\nlandscapes. But why this should have been thought madness in Cosimo\\nwhen Leonardo in his directions to artists explicitly advises them\\nto look hard at spotty walls for inspiration, I cannot say. He\\nwas also the first, to my knowledge, to don ear-caps in tedious\\nsociety -- as Herbert Spencer later used to do. He had many pupils,\\nbut latterly could not bear them in his presence and was therefore\\nbut an indifferent instructor. As a deviser of pageants he was more in\\ndemand than as a painter; but his brush was not idle. Both London and\\nParis have, I think, better examples of his genius than the Uffizi;\\nbut he is well represented at S. Spirito.\\n\\nPiero sent Andrea to the Palazzo Vecchio to study the Leonardo and\\nMichelangelo cartoons, and there he met Franciabigio, with whom\\nhe struck up one of his close friendships, and together they took a\\nstudio and began to paint for a living. Their first work together was\\nthe Baptism of Christ at which we are now looking. The next commission\\nafter the Scalzo was to decorate the courtyard of the Convent of the\\nServi, now known as the Church of the Annunciation; and moving into\\nadjacent lodgings, Andrea met Jacopo Sansovino, the Venetian sculptor,\\nwhose portrait by Bassano is in the Uffizi, a capable all-round\\nman who had studied in Rome and was in the way of helping the young\\nAndrea at all points. It was then too that he met the agreeable and\\nconvivial Rustici, of whom I have said something in the chapter on\\nthe Baptistery, and quickly became something of a blood -- for by this\\ntime, the second decade of the sixteenth century, the simplicity of\\nthe early artists had given place to dashing sophistication and the\\ngreat period was nearly over. For this change the brilliant complex\\ninquiring mind of Leonardo da Vinci was largely responsible, together\\nwith the encouragement and example of Lorenzo de' Medici and such of\\nhis cultured sceptical friends as Alberti, Pico della Mirandola, and\\nPoliziano. But that is a subject too large for this book. Enough that\\na worldly splendour and vivacity had come into artistic life and Andrea\\nwas an impressionable young man in the midst of it. It does not seem to\\nhave affected the power and dexterity of his hand, but it made him a\\nreligious court-painter instead of a religious painter. His sweetness\\nand an underlying note of pathos give his work a peculiar and genuine\\ncharacter; but he is just not of the greatest. Not so great really\\nas Luca Signorelli, for example, whom few visitors to the galleries\\nrush at with gurgling cries of rapture as they rush at Andrea.\\n\\nWhen Andrea was twenty-six he married. The lady was the widow of a\\nhatter. Andrea had long loved her, but the hatter clung outrageously\\nto life. In 1513, however, she was free, and, giving her hand to the\\npainter, his freedom passed for ever. Vasari being among Andrea's\\npupils may be trusted here, and Vasari gives her a bad character,\\nwhich Browning completes. Andrea painted her often, notably in the\\nfresco of the \\\"Nativity of the Virgin,\\\" to which we shall soon come\\nat the Annunziata: a fine statuesque woman by no means unwilling to\\nhave the most popular artist in Florence as her slave.\\n\\nOf the rest of Andrea's life I need say little. He grew steadily in\\nfavour and was always busy; he met Michelangelo and admired him, and\\nMichelangelo warned Raphael in Rome of a little fellow in Florence who\\nwould \\\"make him sweat\\\". Browning, in his monologue, makes this remark\\nof Michelangelo's, and the comparison between Andrea and Raphael that\\nfollows, the kernel of the poem.\\n\\nLike Leonardo and Rustici, Andrea accepted, in 1518, an invitation from\\nFrancis I to visit Paris and once there began to paint for that royal\\npatron. But although his wife did not love him, she wanted him back,\\nand in the midst of his success he returned, taking with him a large\\nsum of money from Francis with which to buy for the king works of\\nart in Italy. That money he misapplied to his own extravagant ends,\\nand although Francis took no punitive steps, the event cannot have\\nimproved either Andrea's position or his peace of mind; while it\\ncaused Francis to vow that he had done with Florentines. Andrea died\\nin 1531, of fever, nursed by no one, for his wife, fearing it might\\nbe the dreaded plague, kept away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nThe SS. Annunziata and the Spedale degli Innocenti\\n\\nAndrea del Sarto again -- Franciabigio outraged -- Alessio\\nBaldovinetti -- Piero de' Medici's church -- An Easter Sunday\\ncongregation -- Andrea's \\\"Madonna del Sacco\\\" -- \\\"The Statue and\\nthe Bust\\\" -- Henri IV -- The Spedale degli Innocenti -- Andrea della\\nRobbia -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Cosimo I and the Etruscans -- Bronzes and\\ntapestries -- Perugino's triptych -- S. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi -- \\\"Very\\nsacred human dust\\\".\\n\\nFrom S. Marco it is an easy step, along the Via Sapienza, to the\\nPiazza dell' Annunziata, where one finds the church of that name,\\nthe Palazzo Riccardi-Mannelli, and opposite it, gay with the famous\\ndella Robbia reliefs of swaddled children, the Spedale degli Innocenti.\\n\\nFirst the church, which is notable for possessing in its courtyard\\nAndrea del Sarto's finest frescoes. This series, of which he was the\\nchief painter, with his friend Franciabigio again as his principal\\nally, depict scenes in the life of the Virgin and S. Filippo. The\\nscene of the Birth of the Virgin has been called the triumph of\\nfresco painting, and certainly it is very gay and life-like in\\nthat medium. The whole picture very charming and easy, with the\\npleasantest colouring imaginable and pretty details, such as the\\nwashing of the baby and the boy warming his hands, while of the two\\nwomen in the foreground, that on the left, facing the spectator,\\nis a portrait of Andrea's wife, Lucrezia. In the Arrival of the\\nMagi we find Andrea himself, the figure second from the right-hand\\nside, pointing; while next to him, on the left, is his friend Jacopo\\nSansovino. The \\\"Dead Man Restored to Life by S. Filippo\\\" is Andrea's\\nnext best. Franciabigio did the scene of the Marriage of the Virgin,\\nwhich contains another of his well-drawn boys on the steps. The injury\\nto this fresco -- the disfigurement of Mary's face -- was the work of\\nthe painter himself, in a rage that the monks should have inspected\\nit before it was ready. Vasari is interesting on this work. He draws\\nattention to it as illustrating \\\"Joseph's great faith in taking her,\\nhis face expressing as much fear as joy\\\". He also says that the blow\\nwhich the man is giving Joseph was part of the marriage ceremony at\\nthat time in Florence.\\n\\nFranciabigio, in spite of his action in the matter of this fresco,\\nseems to have been a very sweet-natured man, who painted rather to be\\nable to provide for his poor relations than from any stronger inner\\nimpulse, and when he saw some works by Raphael gave up altogether,\\nas Verrocchio gave up after Leonardo matured. Franciabigio was a\\nfew years older than Andrea, but died at the same age. Possibly it\\nwas through watching his friend's domestic troubles that he remained\\nsingle, remarking that he who takes a wife endures strife. His most\\ncharming work is that \\\"Madonna of the Well\\\" in the Uffizi, which\\nis reproduced in this volume. Franciabigio's master was Mariotto\\nAlbertinelli, who had learned from Cosimo Rosselli, the teacher\\nof Piero di Cosimo, Andrea's master -- another illustration of the\\ninterdependence of Florentine artists.\\n\\nOne of the most attractive works in the courtyard must once have\\nbeen the \\\"Adoration of the Shepherds\\\" by Alessio Baldovinetti, at\\nthe left of the entrance to the church. It is badly damaged and the\\ncolour has gone, but one can see that the valley landscape, when it\\nwas painted, was a dream of gaiety and happiness.\\n\\nThe particular treasure of the church is the extremely ornate chapel\\nof the Virgin, containing a picture of the Virgin displayed once a\\nyear on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25th, in the painting\\nof which the Virgin herself took part, descending from heaven for\\nthat purpose. The artist thus divinely assisted was Pietro Cavallini,\\na pupil of Giotto. The silver shrine for the picture was designed by\\nMichelozzo and was a beautiful thing before the canopy and all the\\ndistressing accessories were added. It was made at the order of Piero\\nde' Medici, who was as fond of this church as his father Cosimo was\\nof S. Lorenzo. Michelozzo only designed it; the sculpture was done\\nby Pagno di Lapo Portigiani, whose Madonna is over the tomb of Pope\\nJohn by Donatello and Michelozzo in the Baptistery.\\n\\nAmong the altar-pieces are two by Perugino; but of Florentine\\naltar-pieces one can say little or nothing in a book of reasonable\\ndimensions. There are so many and they are for the most part so\\ndifficult to see. Now and then one arrests the eye and holds it;\\nbut for the most part they go unstudied. The rotunda of the choir\\nis interesting, for here we meet again Alberti, who completed it\\nfrom designs by Michelozzo. It does not seem to fit the church from\\nwithin, and even less so from without, but it is a fine structure. The\\nseventeenth-century painting of the dome is almost impressive.\\n\\nBut one can forget and forgive all the church's gaudiness and floridity\\nwhen the choir is in good voice and the strings play Palestrina as\\nthey did last Easter Sunday. The Annunziata is famous for its music,\\nand on the great occasions people crowd there as nowhere else. At High\\nMass the singing was fine but the instrumental music finer. One is\\naccustomed to seeing vicarious worship in Italy; but never was there\\nso vicarious a congregation as ours, and indeed if it had not been\\nfor the sight of the busy celibates at the altar one would not have\\nknown that one was worshipping at all. The culmination of detachment\\ncame when a family of Siamese or Burmese children, in native dress,\\nentered. A positive hum went round, and not an eye but was fixed\\non the little Orientals. When, however, the organ was for a while\\nsuperseded and the violas and violins quivered under the plangent\\nmelody of Palestrina, our roving attention was fixed and held.\\n\\nI am not sure that the Andrea in the cloisters is not the best of\\nall his work. It is very simple and wholly beautiful, and in spite\\nof years of ravage the colouring is still wonderful, perhaps indeed\\nbetter for the hand of Time. It is called the \\\"Madonna del Sacco\\\"\\n(grain sack), and fills the lunette over the door leading from the\\nchurch. The Madonna -- Andrea's favourite type, with the eyes set widely\\nin the flat brow over the little trustful nose -- has her Son, older than\\nusual, sprawling on her knee. Her robes are ample and rich; a cloak\\nof green is over her pretty head. By her sits S. Joseph, on the sack,\\nreading with very long sight. That is all; but one does not forget it.\\n\\nFor the rest the cloisters are a huddle of memorial slabs and\\nindifferent frescoes. In the middle is a well with nice iron work. No\\ngrass at all. The second cloisters, into which it is not easy to get,\\nhave a gaunt John the Baptist in terra-cotta by Michelozzo.\\n\\nOn leaving the church, our natural destination is the Spedale, on the\\nleft, but one should pause a moment in the doorway of the courtyard (if\\nthe beggars who are always there do not make it too difficult) to look\\ndown the Via de' Servi running straight away to the cathedral, which,\\nwith its great red warm dome, closes the street. The statue in the\\nmiddle of the piazza is that of the Grand Duke Ferdinand by Giovanni da\\nBologna, cast from metal taken from the Italians' ancient enemies the\\nTurks, while the fountains are by Tacca, Giovanni's pupil, who made\\nthe bronze boar at the Mercato Nuovo. \\\"The Synthetical Guide Book,\\\"\\nfrom which I have already quoted, warns its readers not to overlook\\n\\\"the puzzling bees\\\" at the back of Ferdinand's statue. \\\"Try to count\\nthem,\\\" it adds. (I accepted the challenge and found one hundred and\\none.) The bees have reference to Ferdinand's emblem -- a swarm of these\\ninsects, with the words \\\"Majestate tantum\\\". The statue, by the way,\\nis interesting for two other reasons than its subject. First, it is\\nthat to which Browning's poem, \\\"The Statue and the Bust,\\\" refers, and\\nwhich, according to the poet, was set here at Ferdinand's command to\\ngaze adoringly for ever at the della Robbia bust of the lady whom he\\nloved in vain. But the bust no longer is visible, if ever it was. John\\nof Douay (as Gian Bologna was also called) -- \\n\\n\\n\\nJohn of Douay shall effect my plan,\\nSet me on horseback here aloft,\\nAlive, as the crafty sculptor can,\\n\\n\\nIn the very square I have crossed so oft:\\nThat men may admire, when future suns\\nShall touch the eyes to a purpose soft,\\n\\n\\nWhile the mouth and the brow stay brave in bronze -- \\nAdmire and say, \\\"when he was alive\\nHow he would take his pleasure once!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other point of interest is that when Maria de' Medici, Ferdinand's\\nniece, wished to erect a statue of Henri IV (her late husband) at the\\nPont Neuf in Paris she asked to borrow Gian Bologna. But the sculptor\\nwas too old to go and therefore only a bronze cast of this same horse\\nwas offered. In the end Tacca completed both statues, and Henri IV\\nwas set up in 1614 (after having fallen overboard on the voyage from\\nLeghorn to Havre). The present statue at the Pont Neuf is, however,\\na modern substitute.\\n\\nThe fa\\u00e7ade of the Spedale degli Innocenti, or children's hospital, when\\nfirst seen by the visitor evokes perhaps the quickest and happiest\\ncry of recognition in all Florence by reason of its row of della\\nRobbia babies, each in its blue circle, reproductions of which have\\ngone all over the world. These are thought to be by Andrea, Luca's\\nnephew, and were added long after the building was completed. Luca\\nprobably helped him. The hospital was begun by Brunelleschi at the\\ncost of old Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo's father, but the Guild of\\nthe Silk Weavers, for whom Luca made the exquisite coat of arms on Or\\nSan Michele, took it over and finished it. Andrea not only modelled\\nthe babies outside but the beautiful Annunciation (of which I give a\\nreproduction in this volume) in the court: one of his best works. The\\nphotograph will show how full of pretty thoughts it is, but in colour\\nit is more charming still and the green of the lily stalks is not\\nthe least delightful circumstance. Not only among works of sculpture\\nbut among Annunciations this relief holds a very high place. Few of\\nthe artists devised a scene in which the great news was brought more\\nengagingly, in sweeter surroundings, or received more simply.\\n\\nThe door of the chapel close by leads to another work of art equally\\nadapted to its situation -- Ghirlandaio's Adoration of the Magi: one of\\nthe perfect pictures for children. We have seen Ghirlandaio's Adoration\\nof the Shepherds at the Accademia: this is its own brother. It has\\nthe sweetest, mildest little Mother, and in addition to the elderly\\nMagi two tiny little saintlings adore too. In the distance is an\\nenchanted landscape about a fairy estuary.\\n\\nThis hospital is a very busy one, and the authorities are glad to show\\nit to visitors who really take an interest in such work. Rich Italians\\ncarry on a fine rivalry in generosity to such institutions. Bologna,\\nfor instance, could probably give lessons in thoughtful charity to\\nthe whole world.\\n\\nThe building opposite the hospital has a loggia which is notable\\nfor a series of four arches, like those of the Mercato Nuovo, and in\\nsummer for the flowers that hang down from the little balconies. A\\npretty building. Before turning to the right under the last of the\\narches of the hospital loggia, which opens on the Via della Colonna\\nand from the piazza always frames such a charming picture of houses\\nand mountains, it is well, with so much of Andrea del Sarto's work\\nwarm in one's memory, to take a few steps up the Via Gino Capponi\\n(which also always frames an Apennine vista under its arch) to No. 24,\\nand see Andrea's house, on the right, marked with a tablet.\\n\\nIn the Via della Colonna we find, at No. 26 on the left, the Palazzo\\nCrocetta, which is now a Museum of Antiquities, and for its Etruscan\\nexhibits is of the greatest historical value and interest to visitors\\nto Tuscany, such as ourselves. For here you may see what civilization\\nwas like centuries before Christ and Rome. The beginnings of the\\nEtruscan people are indistinct, but about 1000 B.C. has been agreed\\nto as the dawn of their era. Etruria comprised Tuscany, Perugia,\\nand Rome itself. Florence has no remains, but Fiesole was a fortified\\nEtruscan town, and many traces of its original builders may be seen\\nthere, together with Etruscan relics in the little museum. For the\\nbest reconstructions of an Etruscan city one must go to Volterra,\\nwhere so many of the treasures in the present building were found.\\n\\nThe Etruscans in their heyday were the most powerful people in\\nthe world, but after the fifth century their supremacy gradually\\ndisappeared, the Gauls on the one side and the Romans on the other\\nwearing them down. All our knowledge of them comes through the\\nspade. Excavations at Volterra and elsewhere have revealed some\\nthousands of inscriptions which have been in part deciphered; but\\nnothing has thrown so much light on this accomplished people as their\\nhabit of providing the ashes of their dead with everything likely\\nto be needed for the next world, whose requirements fortunately so\\nexactly tallied with those of this that a complete system of domestic\\ncivilization can be deduced. In arts and sciences they were most\\nenviably advanced, as a visit to the British Museum will show in\\na moment. But it is to this Florentine Museum of Antiquities that\\nall students of Etruria must go. The garden contains a number of the\\ntombs themselves, rebuilt and refurnished exactly as they were found;\\nwhile on the ground floor is the amazing collection of articles which\\nthe tombs yielded. The grave has preserved them for us, not quite\\nso perfectly as the volcanic dust of Vesuvius preserved the domestic\\nappliances of Pompeii, but very nearly so. Jewels, vessels, weapons,\\nornaments -- many of them of a beauty never since reproduced -- are to\\nbe seen in profusion, now gathered together for study only a short\\ndistance from the districts in which centuries ago they were made\\nand used for actual life.\\n\\nUpstairs we find relics of an older civilization still, the Egyptian,\\nand a few rooms of works of art, all found in Etruscan soil,\\nthe property of the Pierpont Morgans and George Saltings of that\\nancient day, who had collected them exactly as we do now. Certain\\nof the statues are world-famous. Here, for example, in Sala IX, is\\nthe bronze Minerva which was found near Arezzo in 1554 by Cosimo's\\nworkmen. Here is the Chim\\u00e6ra, also from Arezzo in 1554, which Cellini\\nrestored for Cosimo and tells us about in his Autobiography. Here is\\nthe superb Orator from Lake Trasimene, another of Cosimo's discoveries.\\n\\nIn Sala X look at the bronze situla in an isolated glass case, of such\\na peacock blue as only centuries could give it. Upstairs in Sala XVI\\nare many more Greek and Roman bronzes, among which I noticed a faun\\nwith two pipes as being especially good; while the little room leading\\nfrom it has some fine life-size heads, including a noble one of a\\nhorse, and the famous Idolino on its elaborate pedestal -- a full-length\\nGreek bronze from the earth of Pesaro, where it was found in 1530.\\n\\nThe top floor is given to tapestries and embroideries. The collection\\nis vast and comprises much foreign work; but Cosimo I introducing\\ntapestry weaving into Florence, many of the examples come from the\\ncity's looms. The finest, or at any rate most interesting, series\\nis that depicting the court of France under Catherine de' Medici,\\nwith portraits: very sumptuous and gay examples of Flemish work.\\n\\nThe trouble at Florence is that one wants the days to be ten times as\\nlong in order that one may see its wonderful possessions properly. Here\\nis this dry-looking archaeological museum, with antipathetic custodians\\nat the door who refuse to get change for twenty-lira pieces: nothing\\ncould be more unpromising than they or their building; and yet you\\nfind yourself instantly among countless vestiges of a past people who\\nhad risen to power and crumbled again before Christ was born -- but at\\na time when man was so vastly more sensitive to beauty than he now is\\nthat every appliance for daily life was the work of an artist. Well,\\na collection like this demands days and days of patient examination,\\nand one has only a few hours. Were I Joshua -- had I his curious gift -- it\\nis to Florence I would straightway fare. The sun should stand still\\nthere: no rock more motionless.\\n\\nContinuing along the Via della Colonna, we come, on the right,\\nat No. 8, to the convent of S. Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi, which is\\nnow a barracks but keeps sacred one room in which Perugino painted a\\ncrucifixion, his masterpiece in fresco. The work is in three panels,\\nof which that on the left, representing the Virgin and S. Bernard,\\nis the most beautiful. Indeed, there is no more beautiful light\\nin any picture we shall see, and the Virgin's melancholy face is\\ninexpressibly sweet. Perugino is best represented at the Accademia,\\nand there are works of his at the Uffizi and Pitti and in various\\nFlorentine churches; but here he is at his best. Vasari tells us that\\nhe made much money and was very fond of it; also that he liked his\\nyoung wife to wear light head-dresses both out of doors and in the\\nhouse, and often dressed her himself. His master was Verrocchio and\\nhis best pupil Raphael.\\n\\nS. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, a member of the same family that plotted\\nagainst the Medici and owned the sacred flints, was born in 1566, and,\\nsays Miss Dunbar, \\\"showed extraordinary piety from a very tender\\nage\\\". When only a child herself she used to teach small children, and\\nshe daily carried lunch to the prisoners. Her real name was Catherine,\\nbut becoming a nun she called herself Mary Magdalene. In an illness in\\nwhich she was given up for dead, she lay on her bed for forty days,\\nduring which she saw continual visions, and then recovered. Like\\nS. Catherine of Bologna she embroidered well and painted miraculously,\\nand she once healed a leprosy by licking it. She died in 1607.\\n\\nThe old English Cemetery, as it is usually called -- the Protestant\\nCemetery, as it should be called -- is an oval garden of death in the\\nPiazza Donatello, at the end of the Via di Pinti and the Via Alfieri,\\nrising up from the boulevard that surrounds the northern half of\\nFlorence. (The new Protestant Cemetery is outside the city on the\\nroad to the Certosa.) I noticed, as I walked beneath the cypresses,\\nthe grave of Arthur Hugh Clough, the poet of \\\"Dipsychus,\\\" who died\\nhere in Florence on November 13th, 1861; of Walter Savage Landor,\\nthat old lion (born January 30th, 1775; died September 17th, 1864),\\nof whom I shall say much more in a later chapter; of his son Arnold,\\nwho was born in 1818 and died in 1871; and of Mrs. Holman Hunt, who\\ndied in 1866. But the most famous grave is that of Elizabeth Barrett\\nBrowning, who lies beneath a massive tomb that bears only the initials\\nE.B.B. and the date 1861. \\\"Italy,\\\" wrote James Thomson, the poet of\\n\\\"The City of Dreadful Night,\\\" on hearing of Mrs. Browning's death,\\n\\n\\n\\\"Italy, you hold in trust\\nVery sacred human dust.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nThe Cascine and the Arno\\n\\nFlorence's Bois de Boulogne -- Shelley -- The races -- The game of\\nPallone -- SS. Ognissanti -- Botticelli and Ghirlandaio -- Amerigo\\nVespucci -- The Platonic Academy's garden -- Alberti's Palazzo\\nRucellai -- Melancholy decay -- Two smiling boys -- The Corsini\\npalace -- The Trinit\\u00e0 bridge -- The Borgo San Jacopo from the back -- Home\\nfishing -- SS. Apostoli -- A sensitive river -- The Ponte Vecchio -- The\\ngoldsmiths -- S. Stefano.\\n\\nThe Cascine is the \\\"Bois\\\" of Florence; but it does not compare with\\nthe Parisian expanse either in size or attraction. Here the wealthy\\nFlorentines drive, the middle classes saunter and ride bicycles, the\\npoor enjoy picnics, and the English take country walks. The further\\none goes the better it is, and the better also the river, which at\\nthe very end of the woods becomes such a stream as the pleinairistes\\nlove, with pollarded trees on either side. Among the trees of one of\\nthese woods nearly a hundred years ago, a walking Englishman named\\nPercy Bysshe Shelley wrote his \\\"Ode to the West Wind\\\".\\n\\nThe Cascine is a Bois also in having a race-course in it -- a small\\ncourse with everything about it on a little scale, grandstand, betting\\nboxes, and all. And why not? -- for after all Florence is quite small in\\nsize, however remarkable in character. Here funny little race-meetings\\nare held, beginning on Easter Monday and continuing at intervals until\\nthe weather gets too hot. The Florentines pour out in their hundreds\\nand lie about in the long grass among the wild flowers, and in their\\nfives and tens back their fancies. The system is the pari-mutuel,\\nand here one seems to be more at its mercy even than in France. The\\nodds keep distressingly low; but no one seems to be either elated or\\ndepressed, whatever happens. To be at the races is the thing -- to walk\\nabout and watch the people and enjoy the air. It is the most orderly\\nfrugal scene, and the baleful and mysterious power of the racehorse\\nto poison life and landscape, as in England, does not exist here.\\n\\nTo the Cascine also in the spring and autumn several hundred Florentine\\nmen come every afternoon to see the game of pallone and risk a few lire\\non their favourite players. Mr. Ruskin, whose \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\"\\nis still the textbook of the devout, is severe enough upon those\\nvisitors who even find it in their hearts to shop and gossip in the\\ncity of Giotto. What then would he have said of one who has spent not\\na few afternoon hours, between five and six, in watching the game of\\npallone? I would not call pallone a good game. Compared with tennis,\\nit is nothing; compared with lawn tennis, it is poor; compared with\\nfootball, it is anaemic; yet in an Italian city, after the galleries\\nhave closed, on a warm afternoon, it will do, and it will more than\\ndo as affording an opportunity of seeing muscular Italian athletes in\\nthe pink of condition. The game is played by six, three each side:\\na battitore, who smites the ball, which is served to him very much\\nas in rounders; the spalla, who plays back; and the terzino, who\\nplays forward. The court is sixty or more yards long, on one side\\nbeing a very high wall and on the other and at each end netting. The\\nimplements are the ball, which is hollow and of leather, about half\\nthe size of a football, and a cylinder studded with spikes, rather\\nlike a huge fir-cone or pine-apple, which is placed over the wrist\\nand forearm to hit the ball with; and the game is much as in tennis,\\nonly there is no central net: merely a line. Each man's ambition,\\nhowever, is less to defeat the returning power of the foe than to\\nparalyse it by hitting the ball out of reach. It is as though a\\nbatsman were out if he failed to hit three wides.\\n\\nA good battitore, for instance, can smite the ball right down the\\nsixty yards into the net, above the head of the opposing spalla who\\nstands awaiting it at the far end. Such a stroke is to the English\\nmind a blot, and it is no uncommon thing, after each side has had a\\ngood rally, to see the battitore put every ball into the net in this\\nway and so win the game without his opponents having one return;\\nwhich is the very negation of sport. Each innings lasts until one\\nside has gained eight points, the points going to whichever player\\nmakes the successful stroke. This means that the betting -- and of\\ncourse there is betting -- is upon individuals and not upon sides.\\n\\nThe pari-mutuel system is that which is adopted at both the pallone\\ncourts in Florence (there is another at the Piazza Beccaria), and the\\nunit is two lire. Bets are invited on the winner and the second, and\\nplace-money is paid on both. No wonder then that as the game draws to a\\nclose the excitement becomes intense; while during its progress feeling\\nruns high too. For how can a young Florentine who has his money on,\\nsay, Gabri the battitore, withhold criticism when Gabri's arm fails\\nand the ball drops comfortably for the terzino Ugo to smash it into\\nGabri's net? Such a lapse should not pass unnoticed; nor does it.\\n\\nFrom the Cascine we may either return to Florence along the banks\\nof the river, or cross the river by the vile iron Ponte Sospeso\\nand enter the city again, on the Pitti side, by the imposing Porta\\nS. Frediano. Supposing that we return by the Lungarno Amerigo Vespucci\\nthere is little to notice, beyond costly modern houses of a Portland\\nPlace type and the inevitable Garibaldi statue, until, just past the\\noblique pescaja (or weir), we see across the Piazza Manin the church\\nof All Saints -- S. Salvadore d'Ognissanti, which must be visited since\\nit is the burial-place of Botticelli and Amerigo Vespucci, the chapel\\nof the Vespucci family being painted by Ghirlandaio; and since here too\\nlies Botticelli's beautiful Simonetta, who so untimely died. According\\nto Vasari the frescoes of S. Jerome by Ghirlandaio and S. Augustine by\\nBotticelli were done in competition. They were painted, as it happens,\\nelsewhere, but moved here without injury. I think the S. Jerome is the\\nmore satisfying, a benevolent old scientific author -- a Lord Avebury\\nof the canon -- with his implements about him on a tapestry tablecloth,\\na brass candlestick, his cardinal's hat, and a pair of tortoise-shell\\neyeglasses handy. S. Augustine is also scientific; astronomical books\\nand instruments surround him too. His tablecloth is linen.\\n\\nAmerigo Vespucci, whose statue we saw in the Uffizi portico\\ncolonnade, was a Florentine by birth who settled in Spain and took to\\nexploration. His discoveries were important, but America is not really\\namong them, for Columbus, whom he knew and supported financially,\\ngot there first. By a mistake in the date in his account of his\\ntravels, Vespucci's name came to be given to the new continent, and\\nit was then too late to alter it. He became a naturalized Spaniard\\nand died in 1512. Columbus indeed suffers in Florence; for had it\\nnot been for Vespucci, America would no doubt be called Columbia;\\nwhile Brunelleschi anticipated him in the egg trick.\\n\\nThe church is very proud of possessing the robe of S. Francis, which\\nis displayed once a year on October 4th. In the refectory is a \\\"Last\\nSupper\\\" by Ghirlandaio, not quite so good as that which we saw at\\nS. Marco, but very similar, and, like that, deriving from Castagno's\\nat the Cenacolo di Sant' Apollonia. The predestined Judas is once\\nmore on the wrong side of the table.\\n\\nReturning to the river bank again, we are at once among the hotels and\\npensions, which continue cheek by jowl right away to the Ponte Vecchio\\nand beyond. In the Piazza Goldoni, where the Ponte Carraia springs off,\\nseveral streets meet, best of them and busiest of them being that Via\\ndella Vigna Nuova which one should miss few opportunities of walking\\nalong, for here is the palazzo -- at No. 20 -- which Leon Battista Alberti\\ndesigned for the Rucellai. The Rucellai family's present palace, I\\nmay say here, is in the Via della Scala, and by good fortune I found\\nat the door sunning himself a complacent major-domo who, the house\\nbeing empty of its august owners, allowed me to walk through into\\nthe famous garden -- the Orti Oricellari -- where the Platonic Academy\\nmet for a while in Bernardo Rucellai's day. A monument inscribed\\nwith their names has been erected among the evergreens. Afterwards\\nthe garden was given by Francis I to his beloved Bianca Capella. Its\\nnatural beauties are impaired by a gigantic statue of Polyphemus,\\nbigger than any other statue in Florence.\\n\\nThe new Rucellai palace does not compare with the old, which is, I\\nthink, the most beautiful of all the private houses of the great day,\\nand is more easily seen too, for there is a little piazza in front\\nof it. The palace, with its lovely design and its pilastered windows,\\nis now a rookery, while various industries thrive beneath it. Part of\\nthe right side has been knocked away; but even still the proportions\\nare noble. This is a bad quarter for vandalism; for in the piazza\\nopposite is a most exquisite little loggia, built in 1468, the three\\nlovely arches of which have been filled in and now form the windows of\\nan English establishment known as \\\"The Artistic White House\\\". An absurd\\nname, for if it were really artistic it would open up the arches again.\\n\\nThe Rucellai chapel, behind the palace, is in the Via della Spada,\\nand the key must be asked for in the palace stables. It is in a\\nshocking state, and quite in keeping with the traditions of the\\nneighbourhood, while the old church of S. Pancrazio, its neighbour,\\nis now a Government tobacco factory. The Rucellai chapel contains a\\nmodel of the Holy Sepulchre, at Jerusalem, in marble and intarsia,\\nby the great Alberti -- one of the most jewel-like little buildings\\nimaginable. Within it are the faint vestiges of a fresco which the\\nstable-boy calls a Botticelli, and indeed the hands and faces of\\nthe angels, such as one can see of them with a farthing dip, do not\\nrender the suggestion impossible. On the altar is a terra-cotta Christ\\nwhich he calls a Donatello, and again he may be right; but fury at a\\ncondition of things that can permit such a beautiful place to be so\\ndesecrated renders it impossible to be properly appreciative.\\n\\nSince we are here, instead of returning direct to the river let us\\ngo a few yards along this Via della Spada to the left, cross the\\nVia de' Fossi, and so come to the busy Via di Pallazzuolo, on the\\nleft of which, past the piazza of S. Paolino, is the little church of\\nS. Francesco de' Vanchetoni. This church is usually locked, but the key\\nis next door, on the right, and it has to be obtained because over the\\nright sacristy door is a boy's head by Rossellino, and over the left a\\nboy's head by Desiderio da Settignano, and each is joyful and perfect.\\n\\nThe Via de' Fossi will bring us again to the Piazza Goldoni and the\\nArno, and a few yards farther along there is a palace to be seen,\\nthe Corsini, the only palazzo still inhabited by its family to which\\nstrangers are admitted -- the long low white fa\\u00e7ade with statues on\\nthe top and a large courtyard, on the Lungarno Corsini, just after\\nthe Piazza Goldoni. It is not very interesting and belongs to the\\nwrong period, the seventeenth century. It is open on fixed days,\\nand free save that one manservant receives the visitor and another\\nconducts him from room to room. There are many pictures, but few\\nof outstanding merit, and the authorship of some of these has been\\nchallenged. Thus, the cartoon of Julius II, which is called a Raphael\\nand seems to be the sketch for one of the well-known portraits at the\\nPitti, Uffizi, or our National Gallery, is held to be not by Raphael\\nat all. Among the pleasantest pictures are a Lippo Lippi Madonna and\\nChild, a Filippino Lippi Madonna and Child with Angels, and a similar\\ngroup by Botticelli; but one has a feeling that Carlo Dolci and Guido\\nReni are the true heroes of the house. Guido Reni's Lucrezia Romana,\\nwith a dagger which she has already thrust two inches into her bosom,\\nas though it were cheese, is one of the most foolish pictures I ever\\nsaw. The Corsini family having given the world a pope, a case of papal\\nvestments is here. It was this Pope when Cardinal Corsini who said to\\nDr. Johnson's friend, Mrs. Piozzi, meeting him in Florence in 1785,\\n\\\"Well, Madam, you never saw one of us red-legged partridges before,\\nI believe\\\".\\n\\nThere may be more beautiful bridges in the world than the Trinit\\u00e0,\\nbut I have seen none. Its curve is so gentle and soft, and its three\\narches so light and graceful, that I wonder that whenever new bridges\\nare necessary the authorities do not insist upon the Trinit\\u00e0 being\\ncopied. The Ponte Vecchio, of course, has a separate interest of its\\nown, and stands apart, like the Rialto. It is a bridge by chance, one\\nmight almost say. But the Trinit\\u00e0 is a bridge in intent and supreme at\\nthat, the most perfect union of two river banks imaginable. It shows\\nto what depths modern Florence can fall -- how little she esteems her\\npast -- that the iron bridge by the Cascine should ever have been built.\\n\\nThe various yellows of Florence -- the prevailing colours -- are spread\\nout nowhere so favourably as on the Pitti side of the river between\\nthe Trinit\\u00e0 and the Ponte Vecchio on the backs of the houses of the\\nBorgo San Jacopo, and just so must this row have looked for four\\nhundred years. Certain of the occupants of these tenements, even on\\nthe upper floors, have fishing nets, on pulleys, which they let down\\nat intervals during the day for the minute fish which seem to be as\\nprecious to Italian fishermen as sparrows and wrens to Italian gunners.\\n\\nThe great palace at the Trinit\\u00e0 end of this stretch of yellow\\nbuildings -- the Frescobaldi -- must have been very striking when the\\nloggia was open: the three rows of double arches that are now walled\\nin. From this point, as well as from similar points on the other\\nside of the Ponte Vecchio, one realizes the mischief done by Cosimo\\nI's secret passage across it; for not only does the passage impose a\\nstraight line on a bridge that was never intended to have one, but it\\ncuts Florence in two. If it were not for its large central arches one\\nwould, from the other bridges or the embankment, see nothing whatever\\nof the further side of the city; but as it is, through these arches\\none has heavenly vignettes.\\n\\nWe leave the river again for a few minutes about fifty yards along\\nthe Lungarno Acciaioli beyond the Trinit\\u00e0 and turn up a narrow passage\\nto see the little church of SS. Apostoli, where there is a delightful\\ngay ciborium, all bright colours and happiness, attributed to Andrea\\ndella Robbia, with pretty cherubs and pretty angels, and a benignant\\nChrist and flowers and fruit which cannot but chase away gloom and\\ndubiety. Here also is a fine tomb by the sculptor of the elaborate\\nchimney-piece which we saw in the Bargello, Benedetto da Rovezzano,\\nwho also designed the church's very beautiful door. Whether or\\nnot it is true that SS. Apostoli was built by Charlemagne, it is\\ncertainly very old and architecturally of great interest. Vasari says\\nthat Brunelleschi acquired from it his inspiration for S. Lorenzo\\nand S. Spirito. To many Florentines its principal importance is its\\ncustody of the Pazzi flints for the igniting of the sacred fire which\\nin turn ignites the famous Carro.\\n\\nReturning again to the embankment, we are quickly at the Ponte\\nVecchio, where it is pleasant at all times to loiter and observe\\nboth the river and the people; while from its central arches one\\nsees the mountains. From no point are the hill of S. Miniato and\\nits stately cypresses more beautiful; but one cannot see the church\\nitself -- only the church of S. Niccol\\u00f2 below it, and of course the\\nbronze \\\"David\\\". In dry weather the Arno is green; in rainy weather\\nyellow. It is so sensitive that one can almost see it respond to the\\nmost distant shower; but directly the rain falls and it is fed by\\na thousand Apennine torrents it foams past this bridge in fury. The\\nPonte Vecchio was the work, upon a Roman foundation, of Taddeo Gaddi,\\nGiotto's godson, in the middle of the fourteenth century, but the\\nshops are, of course, more recent. The passage between the Pitti\\nand Uffizi was added in 1564. Gaddi, who was a fresco painter first\\nand architect afterwards, was employed because Giotto was absent in\\nMilan, Giotto being the first thought of every one in difficulties\\nat that time. The need, however, was pressing, for a flood in 1333\\nhad destroyed a large part of the Roman bridge. Gaddi builded so well\\nthat when, two hundred and more years later, another flood severely\\ndamaged three other bridges, the Ponte Vecchio was unharmed. None\\nthe less it is not Gaddi's bust but Cellini's that has the post of\\nhonour in the centre; but this is, of course, because Cellini was\\na goldsmith, and it is to goldsmiths that the shops belong. Once it\\nwas the butchers' quarter!\\n\\nI never cross the Ponte Vecchio and see these artificers in their\\nblouses through the windows, without wondering if in any of their boy\\nassistants is the Michelangelo, or Orcagna, or Ghirlandaio, or even\\nCellini, of the future, since all of those, and countless others of\\nthe Renaissance masters, began in precisely this way.\\n\\nThe odd thing is that one is on the Ponte Vecchio, from either\\nend, before one knows it to be a bridge at all. A street of sudden\\nsteepness is what it seems to be. Not the least charming thing upon\\nit is the masses of groundsel which have established themselves on\\nthe pent roof over the goldsmiths' shops. Every visitor to Florence\\nmust have longed to occupy one of these little bridge houses; but I\\nam not aware that any has done so.\\n\\nOne of the oldest streets in Florence must be the Via Girolami, from\\nthe Ponte Vecchio to the Uffizi, under an arch. A turning to the left\\nbrings one to the Piazza S. Stefano, where the barn-like church of\\nS. Stefano is entered; and close by is the Torre de' Girolami, where\\nS. Zenobius lived. S. Stefano, although it is now so easily overlooked,\\nwas of importance in its day, and it was here that Niccol\\u00f2 da Uzzano,\\nthe leader of the nobles, held a meeting to devise means of checking\\nthe growing power of the people early in the fifteenth century and was\\nthwarted by old Giovanni de' Medici. From that thwarting proceeded\\nthe power of the Medici family and the gloriously endowed Florence\\nthat we travel to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nS. Maria Novella\\n\\nThe great churches of Florence -- A Dominican cathedral -- The \\\"Decameron\\\"\\nbegins -- Domenico Ghirlandaio -- Alessio Baldovinetti -- The Louvre -- The\\nS. Maria Novella frescoes -- Giovanni and Lorenzo Tornabuoni -- Ruskin\\nimplacable -- Cimabue's Madonna -- Filippino Lippi -- Orcagna's \\\"Last\\nJudgment\\\" -- The Cloisters of Florence -- The Spanish Chapel -- S. Dominic\\ntriumphant -- Giotto at his sweetest -- The \\\"Wanderer's\\\" doom -- The Piazza,\\nas an arena.\\n\\nS. Maria Novella is usually bracketed with S. Croce as the most\\ninteresting Florentine church after the Duomo, but S. Lorenzo has of\\ncourse to be reckoned with very seriously. I think that for interest\\nI should place S. Maria Novella fifth, including also the Baptistery\\nbefore it, but architecturally second. Its interior is second in\\nbeauty only to S. Croce. S. Croce is its immediate religious rival,\\nfor it was because the Dominicans had S. Maria Novella, begun in\\n1278, that several years later the Franciscans determined to have an\\nequally important church and built S. Croce. The S. Maria Novella\\narchitects were brothers of the order, but Talenti, whom we saw at\\nwork both on Giotto's tower and on San Michele, built the campanile,\\nand Leon Battista Alberti the marble fa\\u00e7ade, many years later. The\\nrichest patrons of S. Maria Novella -- corresponding to the Medici at\\nS. Lorenzo and the Bardi at S. Croce -- were the Rucellai, whose palace,\\ndesigned also by the wonderful versatile Alberti, we have seen.\\n\\nThe interior of S. Maria Novella is very fine and spacious, and\\nit gathers and preserves an exquisite light at all times of the\\nday. Nowhere in Florence is there a finer aisle, with the roof\\nspringing so nobly and masterfully from the eight columns on either\\nside. The whole effect, like that of S. Croce, is rather northern,\\nthe result of the yellow and brown hues; but whereas S. Croce has a\\ncrushing flat roof, this one is all soaring gladness.\\n\\nThe finest view of the interior is from the altar steps looking back\\nto the beautiful circular window over the entrance, a mass of happy\\ncolour. In the afternoon the little plain circular windows high up\\nin the aisle shoot shafts of golden light upon the yellow walls. The\\nhigh altar of inlaid marble is, I think, too bright and too large. The\\nchurch is more impressive on Good Friday, when over this altar is built\\na Calvary with the crucifix on the summit and life-size mourners at its\\nfoot; while a choir and string orchestra make superbly mournful music.\\n\\nI like to think that it was within the older S. Maria Novella that\\nthose seven mirthful young ladies of Florence remained one morning\\nin 1348, after Mass, to discuss plans of escape from the city during\\nthe plague. As here they chatted and plotted, there entered the church\\nthree young men; and what simpler than to engage them as companions in\\ntheir retreat, especially as all three, like all seven of the young\\nwomen, were accomplished tellers of stories with no fear whatever of\\nMrs. Grundy? And thus the \\\"Decameron\\\" of Giovanni Boccaccio came about.\\n\\nS. Maria Novella also resembles S. Croce in its moving groups of\\nsight-seers each in the hands of a guide. These one sees always and\\nhears always: so much so that a reminder has been printed and set up\\nhere and there in this church, to the effect that it is primarily the\\nhouse of God and for worshippers. But S. Maria Novella has not a tithe\\nof S. Croce's treasures. Having almost no tombs of first importance,\\nit has to rely upon its interior beauty and upon its frescoes, and\\nits chief glory, whatever Mr. Ruskin, who hated them, might say, is,\\nfor most people, Ghirlandaio's series of scenes in the life of the\\nVirgin and S. John the Baptist. These cover the walls of the choir\\nand for more than four centuries have given delight to Florentines\\nand foreigners. Such was the thoroughness of their painter in his\\ncolour mixing (in which the boy Michelangelo assisted him) that,\\nalthough they have sadly dimmed and require the best morning light,\\nthey should endure for centuries longer, a reminder not only of\\nthe thoughtful sincere interesting art of Ghirlandaio and of the\\npious generosity of the Tornabuoni family, who gave them, but also\\nof the costumes and carriage of the Florentine ladies at the end\\nof the fifteenth century when Lorenzo the Magnificent was in his\\nzenith. Domenico Ghirlandaio may not be quite of the highest rank\\namong the makers of Florence; but he comes very near it, and indeed,\\nby reason of being Michelangelo's first instructor, perhaps should\\nstand amid them. But one thing is certain -- that without him Florence\\nwould be the poorer by many beautiful works.\\n\\nHe was born in 1449, twenty-one years after the death of Masaccio and\\nthree before Leonardo, twenty-six before Michelangelo, and thirty-four\\nbefore Raphael. His full name was Domenico or Tommaso di Currado di\\nDoffo Bigordi, but his father Tommaso Bigordi, a goldsmith, having\\nhit upon a peculiarly attractive way of making garlands for the hair,\\nwas known as Ghirlandaio, the garland maker; and time has effaced\\nthe Bigordi completely.\\n\\nThe portraits of both Tommaso and Domenico, side by side, occur in the\\nfresco representing Joachim driven from the Temple: Domenico, who is to\\nbe seen second from the extreme right, a little resembles our Charles\\nII. Like his father, and, as we have seen, like most of the artists of\\nFlorence, he too became a goldsmith, and his love of the jewels that\\ngoldsmiths made may be traced in his pictures; but at an early age he\\nwas sent to Alessio Baldovinetti to learn to be a painter. Alessio's\\nwork we find all over Florence: a Last Judgment in the Accademia, for\\nexample, but that is not a very pleasing thing; a Madonna Enthroned,\\nin the Uffizi; the S. Miniato frescoes; the S. Trinit\\u00e0 frescoes;\\nand that extremely charming although faded work in the outer court of\\nSS. Annunziata. For the most delightful picture from his hand, however,\\none has to go to the Louvre, where there is a Madonna and Child (1300\\na), in the early Tuscan room, which has a charm not excelled by any\\nsuch group that I know. The photographers still call it a Piero della\\nFrancesca, and the Louvre authorities omit to name it at all; but it\\nis Alessio beyond question. Next it hangs the best Ghirlandaio that\\nI know -- the very beautiful Visitation, and, to add to the interest\\nof this room to the returning Florentine wanderer, on the same wall\\nare two far more attractive works by Bastiano Mainardi (Ghirlandaio's\\nbrother-in-law and assistant at S. Maria Novella) than any in Florence.\\n\\nAlessio, who was born in 1427, was an open-handed ingenious man who\\ncould not only paint and do mosaic but once made a wonderful clock for\\nLorenzo. His experiments with colour were disastrous: hence most of his\\nfrescoes have perished; but possibly it was through Alessio's mistakes\\nthat Ghirlandaio acquired the use of such a lasting medium. Alessio\\nwas an independent man who painted from taste and not necessity.\\n\\nGhirlandaio's chief influences, however, were Masaccio, at the Carmine,\\nFra Lippo Lippi, and Verrocchio, who is thought also to have been\\nBaldovinetti's pupil and whose Baptism of Christ, in the Accademia,\\npainted when Ghirlandaio was seventeen, must have given Ghirlandaio\\nthe lines for his own treatment of the incident in this church. One\\nhas also only to compare Verrocchio's sculptured Madonnas in the\\nBargello with many of Ghirlandaio's to see the influence again;\\nboth were attracted by a similar type of sweet, easy-natured girl.\\n\\nWhen he was twenty-six Ghirlandaio went to Rome to paint the Sixtine\\nlibrary, and then to San Gimignano, where he was assisted by Mainardi,\\nwho was to remain his most valuable ally in executing the large\\ncommissions which were to come to his workshop. His earliest Florentine\\nfrescoes are those which we shall see at Ognissanti; the Madonna della\\nMisericordia and the Deposition painted for the Vespucci family and\\nonly recently discovered, together with the S. Jerome, in the church,\\nand the Last Supper, in the refectory. By this time Ghirlandaio and\\nBotticelli were in some sort of rivalry, although, so far as I know,\\nfriendly enough, and both went to Rome in 1481, together with Perugino,\\nPiero di Cosimo, Cosimo Rosselli, Luca Signorelli and others, at\\nthe command of Pope Sixtus IV to decorate the Sixtine chapel, the\\nexcommunication of all Florentines which the Pope had decreed after\\nthe failure of the Pazzi Conspiracy to destroy the Medici (as we saw\\nin chapter II) having been removed in order to get these excellent\\nworkmen to the Holy City. Painting very rapidly the little band had\\nfinished their work in six months, and Ghirlandaio was at home again\\nwith such an ambition and industry in him that he once expressed the\\nwish that every inch of the walls of Florence might be covered by\\nhis brush -- and in those days Florence had walls all round it, with\\ntwenty-odd towers in addition to the gates. His next great frescoes\\nwere those in the Palazzo Vecchio and S. Trinita. It was in 1485\\nthat he painted his delightful Adoration, at the Accademia, and in\\n1486 he began his great series at S. Maria Novella, finishing them\\nin 1490, his assistants being his brother David, Benedetto Mainardi,\\nwho married Ghirlandaio's sister, and certain apprentices, among them\\nthe youthful Michelangelo, who came to the studio in 1488.\\n\\nThe story of the frescoes is this. Ghirlandaio when in Rome had\\nmet Giovanni Tornabuoni, a wealthy merchant whose wife had died\\nin childbirth. Her death we have already seen treated in relief by\\nVerrocchio in the Bargello. Ghirlandaio was first asked to beautify\\nin her honour the Minerva at Rome, where she was buried, and this\\nhe did. Later when Giovanni Tornabuoni wished to present S. Maria\\nNovella with a handsome benefaction, he induced the Ricci family,\\nwho owned this chapel, to allow him to re-decorate it, and engaged\\nGhirlandaio for the task. This meant first covering the fast fading\\nfrescoes by Orcagna, which were already there, and then painting over\\nthem. What the Orcagnas were like we cannot know; but the substitute,\\nalthough probably it had less of curious genius in it was undoubtedly\\nmore attractive to the ordinary observer.\\n\\nThe right wall, as one faces the window (whose richness of coloured\\nglass, although so fine in the church as a whole, is here such a\\nprivation), is occupied by scenes in the story of the Baptist; the\\nleft by the life of the Virgin. The left of the lowest pair on the\\nright wall represents S. Mary and S. Elizabeth, and in it a party of\\nGhirlandaio's stately Florentine ladies watch the greeting of the two\\nsaints outside Florence itself, symbolized rather than portrayed,\\nvery near the church in which we stand. The girl in yellow, on the\\nright of the picture, with her handkerchief in her hand and wearing a\\nrich dress, is Giovanna degli Albizzi, who married Lorenzo Tornabuoni\\nat the Villa Lemmi near Florence, that villa from which Botticelli's\\nexquisite fresco, now in the Louvre at the top of the main staircase,\\nin which she again is to be seen, was taken. Her life was a sad\\none, for her husband was one of those who conspired with Piero di\\nLorenzo de' Medici for his return some ten years later, and was\\nbeheaded. S. Elizabeth is of course the older woman. The companion\\nto this picture represents the angel appearing to S. Zacharias, and\\nhere again Ghirlandaio gives us contemporary Florentines, portraits\\nof distinguished Tornabuoni men and certain friends of eminence\\namong them. In the little group low down on the left, for example,\\nare Poliziano and Marsilio Ficino, the Platonist. Above -- but seeing\\nis beginning to be difficult -- the pair of frescoes represent, on the\\nright, the birth of the Baptist, and on the left, his naming. The birth\\nscene has much beauty, and is as well composed as any, and there is\\na girl in it of superb grace and nobility; but the birth scene of the\\nVirgin, on the opposite wall, is perhaps the finer and certainly more\\neasily seen. In the naming of the child we find Medici portraits once\\nmore, that family being related to the Tornabuoni; and Mr. Davies,\\nin his book on Ghirlandaio, offers the interesting suggestion, which\\nhe supports very reasonably, that the painter has made the incident\\nrefer to the naming of Lorenzo de' Medici's third son, Giovanni (or\\nJohn), who afterwards became Pope Leo X. In that case the man on the\\nleft, in green, with his hand on his hip, would be Lorenzo himself,\\nwhom he certainly resembles. Who the sponsor is is not known. The\\nlandscape and architecture are alike charming.\\n\\nAbove these we faintly see that strange Baptism of Christ, so curiously\\nlike the Verrocchio in the Accademia, and the Baptist preaching.\\n\\nThe left wall is perhaps the favourite. We begin with Joachim being\\ndriven from the Temple, one of the lowest pair; and this has a peculiar\\ninterest in giving us a portrait of the painter and his associates -- the\\nfigure on the extreme right being Benedetto Mainardi; then Domenico\\nGhirlandaio; then his father; and lastly his brother David. On the\\nopposite side of the picture is the fated Lorenzo Tornabuoni, of whom\\nI have spoken above, the figure farthest from the edge, with his hand\\non his hip. The companion picture is the most popular of all -- the\\nBirth of the Virgin -- certainly one of the most charming interiors in\\nFlorence. Here again we have portraits -- no doubt Tornabuoni ladies -- and\\nmuch pleasant fancy on the part of the painter, who made everything as\\nbeautiful as he could, totally unmindful of the probabilities. Ruskin\\nis angry with him for neglecting to show the splashing of the water\\nin the vessel, but it would be quite possible for no splashing to\\nbe visible, especially if the pouring had only just begun; but for\\nRuskin's strictures you must go to \\\"Mornings in Florence,\\\" where poor\\nGhirlandaio gets a lash for every virtue of Giotto. Next -- above, on\\nthe left -- we have the Presentation of the Virgin and on the right\\nher Marriage. The Presentation is considered by Mr. Davies to be\\nalmost wholly the work of Ghirlandaio's assistants, while the youthful\\nMichelangelo himself has been credited with the half-naked figure on\\nthe steps, although Mr. Davies gives it to Mainardi. Mainardi again\\nis probably the author of the companion scene. The remaining frescoes\\nare of less interest and much damaged; but in the window wall one\\nshould notice the portraits of Giovanni Tornabuoni and Francesca di\\nLuca Pitti, his wife, kneeling, because this Giovanni was the donor\\nof the frescoes, and his sister Lucrezia was the wife of Piero de'\\nMedici and therefore the mother of Lorenzo the Magnificent, while\\nFrancesca Tornabuoni, the poor lady who died in childbirth, was the\\ndaughter of that proud Florentine who began the Pitti palace but\\nended his life in disgrace.\\n\\nAnd so we leave this beautiful recess, where pure religious feeling\\nmay perhaps be wanting but where the best spirit of the Renaissance\\nis to be found: everything making for harmony and pleasure; and on\\nreturning to London the visitor should make a point of seeing the\\nFlorentine girl by the same hand in our National Gallery, No. 1230,\\nfor she is very typical of his genius.\\n\\nOn the entrance wall of the church is what must once have been a fine\\nMasaccio -- \\\"The Trinity\\\" -- but it is in very bad condition; while in\\nthe Cappella Rucellai in the right transept is what purports to be\\na Cimabue, very like the one in the Accademia, but with a rather\\nmore matured Child in it. Vasari tells us that on its completion\\nthis picture was carried in stately procession from the painter's\\nstudio to the church, in great rejoicing and blowing of trumpets,\\nthe populace being moved not only by religious ecstasy but by pride in\\nan artist who could make such a beautiful and spacious painting, the\\nlargest then known. Vasari adds that when Cimabue was at work upon it,\\nCharles of Anjou, visiting Florence, was taken to his studio, to see\\nthe wonderful painter, and a number of Florentines entering too, they\\nbroke out into such rejoicings that the locality was known ever after\\nas Borgo Allegro, or Joyful Quarter. This would be about 1290. There\\nwas a certain fitness in Cimabue painting this Madonna, for it is said\\nthat he had his education in the convent which stood here before the\\npresent church was begun. But I should add that of Cimabue we know\\npractically nothing, and that most of Vasari's statements have been\\nconfuted, while the painter of the S. Maria Novella Madonna is held\\nby some authorities to be Duccio of Siena. So where are we?\\n\\nThe little chapel next the choir on the right is that of Filippo\\nStrozzi the elder who was one of the witnesses of the Pazzi outrage in\\nthe Duomo in 1478. This was the Filippo Strozzi who began the Strozzi\\npalace in 1489, father of the Filippo Strozzi who married Lorenzo\\nde' Medici's noble grand-daughter Clarice and came to a tragic end\\nunder Cosimo I. Old Filippo's tomb here was designed by Benedetto da\\nMaiano, who made the famous Franciscan pulpit in S. Croce, and was\\nGhirlandaio's friend and the Strozzi palace's first architect. The\\nbeautiful circular relief of the Virgin and Child, with a border of\\nroses and flying worshipping angels all about it, behind the altar, is\\nBenedetto's too, and very lovely and human are both Mother and Child.\\n\\nThe frescoes in this chapel, by Filippino Lippi, are interesting,\\nparticularly that one on the left, depicting the Resuscitation of\\nDrusiana by S. John the Evangelist, at Rome, in which the group of\\nwomen and children on the right, with the little dog, is full of\\nlife and most naturally done. Above (but almost impossible to see)\\nis S. John in his cauldron of boiling oil between Roman soldiers and\\nthe denouncing Emperor, under the banner S.P.Q.R. -- a work in which\\nRoman local colour completely excludes religious feeling. Opposite,\\nbelow, we see S. Philip exorcising a dragon, a very florid scene,\\nand, above, a painfully spirited and realistic representation of the\\nCrucifixion. The sweetness of the figures of Charity and Faith in\\nmonochrome and gold helps, with Benedetto's tondo, to engentle the air.\\n\\nWe then come again to the Choir, with Ghirlandaio's urbane Florentine\\npageant in the guise of sacred history, and pass on to the next chapel,\\nthe Cappella Gondi, where that crucifix in wood is to be seen which\\nBrunelleschi carved as a lesson to Donatello, who received it like\\nthe gentleman he was. I have told the story in Chapter XV.\\n\\nThe left transept ends in the chapel of the Strozzi family, of which\\nFilippo was the head in his day, and here we find Andrea Orcagna and\\nhis brother's fresco of Heaven, the Last Judgment and Hell. It was\\nthe two Orcagnas who, according to Vasari, had covered the Choir with\\nthose scenes in the life of the Virgin which Ghirlandaio was allowed\\nto paint over, and Vasari adds that the later artist availed himself\\nof many of the ideas of his predecessors. This, however, is not\\nvery likely, I think, except perhaps in choice of subject. Orcagna,\\nlike Giotto, and later, Michelangelo, was a student of Dante, and\\nthe Strozzi chapel frescoes follow the poet's descriptions. In the\\nLast Judgment, Dante himself is to be seen, among the elect, in the\\nattitude of prayer. Petrarch is with him.\\n\\nThe sacristy is by Talenti (of the Campanile) and was added in\\n1350. Among its treasures once were the three reliquaries painted\\nby Fra Angelico, but they are now at S. Marco. It has still rich\\nvestments, fine woodwork, and a gay and elaborate lavabo by one of\\nthe della Robbias, with its wealth of ornament and colour and its\\ncharming Madonna and Child with angels.\\n\\nA little doorway close by used to lead to the cloisters, and a\\nmercenary sacristan was never far distant, only too ready to unlock for\\na fee what should never have been locked, and black with fury if he got\\nnothing. But all this has now been done away with, and the entrance\\nto the cloisters is from the Piazza, just to the left of the church,\\nand there is a turnstile and a fee of fifty centimes. At S. Lorenzo the\\ncloisters are free. At the Carmine and the Annunziata the cloisters\\nare free. At S. Croce the charge is a lira and at S. Maria Novella\\nhalf a lira. To make a charge for the cloisters alone seems to me\\nutterly wicked. Let the Pazzi Chapel at S. Croce and the Spanish\\nChapel here have fees, if you like; but the cloisters should be open\\nto all. Children should be encouraged to play there.\\n\\nSince, however, S. Maria Novella imposes a fee we must pay it,\\nand the new arrangement at any rate carries this advantage with it,\\nthat one knows what one is expected to pay and can count on entrance.\\n\\nThe cloisters are everywhere interesting to loiter in, but their\\nchief fame is derived from the Spanish Chapel, which gained that name\\nwhen in 1566 it was put at the disposal of Eleanor of Toledo's suite\\non the occasion of her marriage to Cosimo I. Nothing Spanish about\\nit otherwise. Both structure and frescoes belong to the fourteenth\\ncentury. Of these frescoes, which are of historical and human interest\\nrather than artistically beautiful, that one on the right wall as\\nwe enter is the most famous. It is a pictorial glorification of the\\nDominican order triumphant; with a vivid reminder of the origin of\\nthe word Dominican in the episode of the wolves (or heretics) being\\nattacked by black and white dogs, the Canes Domini, or hounds of the\\nLord. The \\\"Mornings in Florence\\\" should here be consulted again, for\\nRuskin made a very thorough and characteristically decisive analysis\\nof these paintings, which, whether one agrees with it or not, is\\nprofoundly interesting. Poor old Vasari, who so patiently described\\nthem too and named a number of the originals of the portraits, is now\\nshelved, and from both his artists, Simone Martini and Taddeo Gaddi,\\nhas the authorship been taken by modern experts. Some one, however,\\nmust have done the work. The Duomo as represented here is not the\\nDuomo of fact, which had not then its dome, but of anticipation.\\n\\nOpposite, we see a representation of the triumph of the greatest of the\\nDominicans, after its founder, S. Thomas Aquinas, the author of the\\n\\\"Summa Theologiae,\\\" who died in 1274. The painter shows the Angelic\\nDoctor enthroned amid saints and patriarchs and heavenly attendants,\\nwhile three powerful heretics grovel at his feet, and beneath are the\\nSciences and Moral Qualities and certain distinguished men who served\\nthem conspicuously, such as Aristotle, the logician, whom S. Thomas\\nAquinas edited, and Cicero, the rhetorician. In real life Aquinas was\\nso modest and retiring that he would accept no exalted post from the\\nChurch, but remained closeted with his books and scholars; and we can\\nconceive what his horror would be could he view this apotheosis. On the\\nceiling is a quaint rendering of the walking on the water, S. Peter's\\nfailure being watched from the ship with the utmost closeness by the\\nother disciples, but attracting no notice whatever from an angler,\\nclose by, on the shore. The chapel is desolate and unkempt, and those\\nof us who are not Dominicans are not sorry to leave it and look for\\nthe simple sweetness of the Giottos.\\n\\nThese are to be found, with some difficulty, on the walls of the niche\\nwhere the tomb of the Marchese Ridolfo stands. They are certainly\\nvery simple and telling, and I advise every one to open the \\\"Mornings\\nin Florence\\\" and learn how the wilful magical pen deals with them;\\nbut it would be a pity to give up Ghirlandaio because Giotto was so\\ndifferent, as Ruskin wished. Room for both. One scene represents\\nthe meeting of S. Joachim and S. Anna outside a mediaeval city's\\nwalls, and it has some pretty Giottesque touches, such as the man\\ncarrying doves to the Temple and the angel uniting the two saints\\nin friendliness; and the other is the Birth of the Virgin, which\\nRuskin was so pleased to pit against Ghirlandaio's treatment of the\\nsame incident. Well, it is given to some of us to see only what we\\nwant to see and be blind to the rest; and Ruskin was of these the\\nvery king. I agree with him that Ghirlandaio in both his Nativity\\nfrescoes thought little of the exhaustion of the mothers; but it is\\narguable that two such accouchements might with propriety be treated\\nas abnormal -- as indeed every painter has treated the birth of Christ,\\nwhere the Virgin, fully dressed, is receiving the Magi a few moments\\nafter. Ruskin, after making his deadly comparisons, concludes thus\\ngenially of the Giotto version -- \\\"If you can be pleased with this,\\nyou can see Florence. But if not, by all means amuse yourself there,\\nif you can find it amusing, as long as you like; you can never see it.\\\"\\n\\nThe S. Maria Novella habit is one to be quickly contracted by the\\nvisitor to Florence: nearly as important as the S. Croce habit. Both\\nchurches are hospitable and, apart from the cloisters, free and\\neminently suited for dallying in; thus differing from the Duomo,\\nwhich is dark, and S. Lorenzo, where there are payments to be made\\nand attendants to discourage.\\n\\nAn effort should be made at S. Maria Novella to get into the old\\ncloisters, which are very large and indicate what a vast convent it\\nonce was. But there is no certainty. The way is to go through to the\\nPalaestra and hope for the best. Here, as I have said in the second\\nchapter, were lodged Pope Eugenius and his suite, when they came\\nto the Council of Florence in 1439. These large and beautiful green\\ncloisters are now deserted. Through certain windows on the left one\\nmay see chemists at work compounding drugs and perfumes after old\\nDominican recipes, to be sold at the Farmacia in the Via della Scala\\nclose by. The great refectory has been turned into a gymnasium.\\n\\nThe two obelisks, supported by tortoises and surmounted by beautiful\\nlilies, in the Piazza of S. Maria Novella were used as boundaries in\\nthe chariot races held here under Cosimo I, and in the collection of\\nold Florentine prints on the top floor of Michelangelo's house you\\nmay see representations of these races. The charming loggia opposite\\nS. Maria Novella, with della Robbia decorations, is the Loggia di\\nS. Paolo, a school designed, it is thought, by Brunelleschi, and\\nhere, at the right hand end, we see S. Dominic himself in a friendly\\nembrace with S. Francis, a very beautiful group by either Luca or\\nAndrea della Robbia.\\n\\nIn the loggia cabmen now wrangle all day and all night. From it\\nS. Maria Novella is seen under the best conditions, always cheerful\\nand serene; while far behind the church is the huge Apennine where\\nmost of the weather of Florence seems to be manufactured. In mid\\nApril this year (1912) it still had its cap of snow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nThe Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele to S. Trinit\\u00e0\\n\\nA city of trams -- The old market -- Donatello's figure of Abundance -- An\\nevening resort -- A hall of variety -- Florentines of to-day -- The war\\nwith Turkey -- Homecoming heroes -- Restaurants -- The new market -- The\\nbronze boar -- A fifteenth century palace -- Old Florentine life\\nreconstructed -- Where changes are few -- S. Trinit\\u00e0 -- Ghirlandaio\\nagain -- S. Francis -- The Strozzi palace -- Clarice de' Medici.\\n\\nFlorence is not simple to the stranger. Like all very old cities\\nbuilt fortuitously it is difficult to learn: the points of the\\ncompass are elusive; the streets are so narrow that the sky is no\\nconstant guide; the names of the streets are often not there; the\\npolicemen have no high standard of helpfulness. There are trams,\\nit is true -- too many and too noisy, and too near the pavement -- but\\nthe names of their outward destinations, from the centre, too rarely\\ncorrespond to any point of interest that one is desiring. Hence one\\nhas many embarrassments and even annoyances. Yet I daresay this is\\nbest: an orderly Florence is unthinkable. Since, however, the trams\\nthat are returning to the centre nearly all go to the Duomo, either\\npassing it or stopping there, the tram becomes one's best friend and\\nthe Duomo one's starting point for most excursions.\\n\\nSupposing ourselves to be there once more, let us quickly get through\\nthe horrid necessity, which confronts one in all ancient Italian\\ncities, of seeing the Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele. In an earlier chapter\\nwe left the Baptistery and walked along the Via Calzaioli. Again\\nstarting from the Baptistery let us take the Via dell' Arcivescovado,\\nwhich is parallel with the Via Calzaioli, on the right of it, and\\nagain walk straight forward. We shall come almost at once to the\\ngreat modern square.\\n\\nNo Italian city or town is complete without a Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele\\nand a statue of that monarch. In Florence the sturdy king bestrides\\nhis horse here. Italy being so old and Vittorio Emmanuele so new,\\nit follows in most cases that the square or street named after\\nhim supplants an older one, and if the Italians had any memory or\\nimaginative interest in history they would see to it that the old\\nname was not wholly obliterated. In Florence, in order to honour the\\nfirst king of United Italy, much grave violence was done to antiquity,\\nfor a very picturesque quarter had to be cleared away for the huge\\nbrasseries, stores and hotels which make up the west side; which\\nin their turn marked the site of the old market where Donatello and\\nBrunelleschi and all the later artists of the great days did their\\nshopping and met to exchange ideals and banter; and that market in\\nits turn marked the site of the Roman forum.\\n\\nOne of the features of the old market was the charming Loggia di Pesce;\\nanother, Donatello's figure of Abundance, surmounting a column. This\\nfigure is now in the museum of ancient city relics in the monastery\\nof S. Marco, where one confronts her on a level instead of looking\\nup at her in mid sky. But she is very good, none the less.\\n\\nIn talking to elderly persons who can remember Florence forty and fifty\\nyears ago I find that nothing so distresses them as the loss of the\\nold quarter for the making of this new spacious piazza; and probably\\nnothing can so delight the younger Florentines as its possession,\\nfor, having nothing to do in the evenings, they do it chiefly in the\\nPiazza Vittorio Emmanuele. Chairs and tables spring up like mushrooms\\nin the roadway, among which too few waiters distribute those very\\ninexpensive refreshments which seem to be purchased rather for the\\nright to the seat that they confer than for any stimulation. It is\\nextraordinary to the eyes of the thriftless English, who are never\\nso happy as when they are overpaying Italian and other caterers in\\ntheir own country, to notice how long these wiser folk will occupy\\na table on an expenditure of fourpence.\\n\\nI do not mean that there are no theatres in Florence. There are\\nmany, but they are not very good; and the young men can do without\\nthem. Curious old theatres, faded and artificial, all apparently built\\nfor the comedies of Goldoni. There are cinema theatres too, at prices\\nwhich would delight the English public addicted to those insidious\\nentertainments, but horrify English managers; and the Teatro Salvini\\nat the back of the Palazzo Vecchio is occasionally transformed into a\\nFolies Berg\\u00e8res (as it is called) where one after another comediennes\\nsing each two or three songs rapidly to an audience who regard them\\nwith apathy and converse without ceasing. The only sign of interest\\nwhich one observes is the murmur which follows anything a little\\noff the beaten track -- a sound that might equally be encouragement\\nor disapproval. But a really pretty woman entering a box moves\\nthem. Then they employ every note in the gamut; and curiously enough\\nthe pretty woman in the box is usually as cool under the fusillade\\nas a professional and hardened sister would be. A strange music hall\\nthis to the English eye, where the orchestra smokes, and no numbers\\nare put up, and every one talks, and the intervals seem to be hours\\nlong. But the Florentines do not mind, for they have not the English\\nthirst for entertainment and escape; they carry their entertainment\\nwith them and do not wish to escape -- going to such places only because\\nthey are warmer than out of doors.\\n\\nSitting here and watching their ironical negligence of the stage and\\ntheir interest in each other's company; their animated talk and rapid\\ndecisions as to the merits and charms of a performer; the comfort of\\ntheir attitudes and carelessness (although never quite slovenliness)\\nin dress; one seems to realize the nation better than anywhere. The\\nold fighting passion may have gone; but much of the quickness, the\\nshrewdness and the humour remains, together with the determination of\\neach man to have if possible his own way and, whether possible or not,\\nhis own say.\\n\\nSeeing them in great numbers one quickly learns and steadily\\ncorroborates the fact that the Florentines are not beautiful. A\\npretty woman or a handsome man is a rarity; but a dull-looking man\\nor woman is equally rare. They are shrewd, philosophic, cynical, and\\nvery ready for laughter. They look contented also: Florence clearly\\nis the best place to be born in, to live in, and to die in. Let all\\nthe world come to Florence, by all means, and spend its money there;\\nbut don't ask Florence to go to the world. Don't in fact ask Florence\\nto do anything very much.\\n\\nCivilization and modern conditions have done the Florentines no\\ngood. Their destiny was to live in a walled city in turbulent\\ndays, when the foe came against it, or tyranny threatened from\\nwithin and had to be resisted. They were then Florentines and\\neverything mattered. To-day they are Italians and nothing matters\\nvery much. Moreover, it must be galling to have somewhere in the\\nrecesses of their consciousness the knowledge that their famous city,\\nbuilt and cemented with their ancestors' blood, is now only a museum.\\n\\nWhen it is fine and warm the music hall does not exist, and it is\\nin the Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele that the Florentines sit and talk,\\nor walk and talk, or listen to the band which periodically inhabits a\\nstand near the centre; and it was here that I watched the reception\\nof the news that Italy had declared war on Turkey, a decision which\\nwhile it rejoiced the national warlike spirit of the populace could\\nnot but carry with it a reminder that wars have to be paid for. Six\\nor seven months later I saw the return to Florence of the first\\ntroops from the war, and their reception was terrific. In the mass\\nthey were welcome enough; but as soon as units could be separated\\nfrom the mass the fun began, for they were carried shoulder high to\\nwhatever destination they wanted, their knapsacks and rifles falling\\nto proud bearers too; while the women clapped from the upper windows,\\nthe shrewd shopkeepers cheered from their doorways, and the crowd which\\nfollowed and surrounded the hero every moment increased. As for the\\nheroes, they looked for the most part a good deal less foolish than\\nEnglishmen would have done; but here and there was one whose expression\\nsuggested that the Turks were nothing to this. One poor fellow had\\nhis coat dragged from his back and torn into a thousand souvenirs.\\n\\nThe restaurants of Florence are those of a city where the natives\\nare thrifty and the visitors dine in hotels. There is one expensive\\nhigh-class house, in the Via Tornabuoni -- Doney e Nipoti or Doney\\net Neveux -- where the cooking is Franco-Italian, and the Chianti and\\nwines are dear beyond belief, and the venerable waiters move with a\\ndeliberation which can drive a hungry man -- and one is always hungry\\nin this fine Tuscan air -- to despair. I like better the excellent\\nold-fashioned purely Italian food and Chianti and speed at Bonciani's\\nin the Via de Panzani, close to the station. These twain are the\\nbest. But it is more interesting to go to the huge Gambrinus in\\nthe Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele, because so much is going on all the\\ntime. One curious Florentine habit is quickly discovered and resented\\nby the stranger who frequents a restaurant, and that is the system of\\nchanging waiters from one set of tables to another; so that whereas\\nin London and Paris the wise diner is true to a corner because it\\ncarries the same service with it, in Florence he must follow the\\nservice. But if the restaurants have odd ways, and a limited range of\\ndishes and those not very interesting, they make up for it by being\\nastonishingly quick. Things are cooked almost miraculously.\\n\\nThe Florentines eat little. But greediness is not an Italian fault. No\\ngreedy people would have a five-syllabled word for waiter.\\n\\nContinuing along the Via dell' Arcivescovado, which after the Piazza\\nbecomes the Via Celimana, we come to that very beautiful structure\\nthe Mercato Nuovo, which, however, is not so wonderfully new, having\\nbeen built as long ago as 1547-1551. Its columns and arched roof are\\nexquisitely proportioned. As a market it seems to be a poor affair,\\nthe chief commodity being straw hats. For the principal food market one\\nhas to go to the Via d'Ariento, near S. Lorenzo, and this is, I think,\\nwell worth doing early in the morning. Lovers of Hans Andersen go to\\nthe Mercato Nuovo to see the famous bronze boar (or \\\"metal pig,\\\" as it\\nwas called in the translation on which I was brought up) that stands\\nhere, on whose back the little street boy had such adventures. The\\nboar himself was the work of Pietro Tacca (1586-1650), a copy from\\nan ancient marble original, now in the Uffizi, at the top of the\\nentrance stairs; but the pedestal with its collection of creeping\\nthings is modern. The Florentines who stand in the market niches are\\nBernardo Cennini, a goldsmith and one of Ghiberti's assistants, who\\nintroduced printing into Florence in 1471 and began with an edition of\\nVirgil; Giovanni Villani, who was the city's first serious historian,\\nbeginning in 1300 and continuing till his death in 1348; and Michele\\nLando, the wool-carder, who on July 22nd, 1378, at the head of a mob,\\noverturned the power of the Signory.\\n\\nBy continuing straight on we should come to that crowded and fussy\\nlittle street which crosses the river by the Ponte Vecchio and\\neventually becomes the Roman way; but let us instead turn to the\\nright this side of the market, down the Via Porta Rossa, because\\nhere is the Palazzo Davanzati, which has a profound interest to\\nlovers of the Florentine past in that it has been restored exactly\\nto its ancient state when Pope Eugenius IV lodged here, and has been\\nfilled with fourteenth and fifteenth century furniture. In those days\\nit was the home of the Davizza family. The Davanzati bought it late\\nin the sixteenth century and retained it until 1838. In 1904 it was\\nbought by Professor Elia Volpi, who restored its ancient conditions\\nand presented it to the city as a permanent monument of the past.\\n\\nHere we see a mediaeval Florentine palace precisely as it was when its\\nFlorentine owner lived his uncomfortable life there. For say what one\\nmay, there is no question that life must have been uncomfortable. In\\nearly and late summer, when the weather was fine and warm, these\\nstone floors and continuous draughts may have been solacing; but in\\nwinter and early spring, when Florentine weather can be so bitterly\\nhostile, what then? That there was a big fire we know by the smoky\\ncondition of Michelozzo's charming frieze on the chimney piece; but\\nthe room -- I refer to that on the first floor -- is so vast that this\\nfire can have done little for any one but an immediate vis-\\u00e0-vis;\\nand the room, moreover, was between the open world on the one side,\\nand the open court (now roofed in with glass) on the other, with\\nsuch additional opportunities for draughts as the four trap-doors\\nin the floor offered. It was through these traps that the stone\\ncannon-balls still stacked in the window seats were dropped, or a few\\ngallons of boiling oil poured, whenever the city or a faction of it\\nturned against the householder. Not comfortable, you see, at least\\nnot in our northern sense of the word, although to the hardy frugal\\nFlorentine it may have seemed a haven of luxury.\\n\\nThe furniture of the salon is simple and sparse and very hard. A bust\\nhere, a picture there, a coloured plate, a crucifix, and a Madonna\\nand Child in a niche: that was all the decoration save tapestry. An\\nhour glass, a pepper mill, a compass, an inkstand, stand for utility,\\nand quaint and twisted musical instruments and a backgammon board\\nfor beguilement.\\n\\nIn the salle-\\u00e0-manger adjoining is less light, and here also is\\na symbol of Florentine unrest in the shape of a hole in the wall\\n(beneath the niche which holds the Madonna and Child) through which\\nthe advancing foe, who had successfully avoided the cannon balls\\nand the oil, might be prodded with lances, or even fired at. The\\nnext room is the kitchen, curiously far from the well, the opening\\nto which is in the salon, and then a bedroom (with some guns in it)\\nand smaller rooms gained from the central court.\\n\\nThe rest of the building is the same -- a series of self-contained\\nflats, but all dipping for water from the same shaft and all depending\\nanxiously upon the success of the first floor with invaders. At the\\ntop is a beautiful loggia with Florence beneath it.\\n\\nThe odd thing to remember is that for the poor of Florence, who now\\ninhabit houses of the same age as the Davanzati palace, the conditions\\nare almost as they were in the fifteenth century. A few changes have\\ncome in, but hardly any. Myriads of the tenements have no water laid\\non: it must still be pulled up in buckets exactly as here. Indeed you\\nmay often see the top floor at work in this way; and there is a row\\nof houses on the left of the road to the Certosa, a little way out\\nof Florence, with a most elaborate network of bucket ropes over many\\ngardens to one well. Similarly one sees the occupants of the higher\\nfloors drawing vegetables and bread in baskets from the street and\\nlowering the money for them. The postman delivers letters in this\\nway, too. Again, one of the survivals of the Davanzati to which the\\ncustodian draws attention is the rain-water pipe, like a long bamboo,\\ndown the wall of the court; but one has but to walk along the Via\\nLambertesca, between the Uffizi and the Via Por S. Maria, and peer\\ninto the alleys, to see that these pipes are common enough yet.\\n\\nIn fact, directly one leaves the big streets Florence is still\\nfifteenth century. Less colour in the costumes, and a few anachronisms,\\nsuch as gas or electric light, posters, newspapers, cigarettes, and\\nbicycles, which dart like dragon flies (every Florentine cyclist\\nbeing a trick cyclist); but for the rest there is no change. The\\nbusiness of life has not altered; the same food is eaten, the same\\nvessels contain it, the same fire cooks it, the same red wine is\\nmade from the same grapes in the same vineyards, the same language\\n(almost) is spoken. The babies are christened at the same font,\\nthe parents visit the same churches. Similarly the handicrafts can\\nhave altered little. The coppersmith, the blacksmith, the cobbler,\\nthe woodcarver, the goldsmiths in their yellow smocks, must be just\\nas they were, and certainly the cellars and caverns under the big\\nhouses in which they work have not changed. Where the change is,\\nis among the better-to-do, the rich, and in the government. For no\\nlonger is a man afraid to talk freely of politics; no longer does he\\nshudder as he passes the Bargello; no longer is the name of Medici\\non his lips. Everything else is practically as it was.\\n\\nThe Via Porta Rossa runs to the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0, the church of\\nS. Trinit\\u00e0 being our destination. For here are some interesting\\nfrescoes. First, however, let us look at the sculpture: a very\\nbeautiful altar by Benedetto da Rovezzano in the fifth chapel of the\\nright aisle; a monument by Luca della Robbia to one of the archbishops\\nof Fiesole, once in S. Pancrazio (which is now a tobacco factory)\\nin the Via della Spada and brought here for safe keeping -- a beautiful\\nexample of Luca's genius, not only as a modeller but also as a very\\ntreasury of pretty thoughts, for the border of flowers and leaves is\\nbeyond praise delightful. The best green in Florence (after Nature's,\\nwhich is seen through so many doorways and which splashes over so\\nmany white walls and mingles with gay fruits in so many shops) is here.\\n\\nIn the fifth chapel of the left aisle is a Magdalen carved in wood\\nby Desiderio da Settignano and finished by Benedetto da Maiano;\\nwhile S. Trinit\\u00e0 now possesses, but shows only on Good Friday,\\nthe very crucifix from S. Miniato which bowed down and blessed\\nS. Gualberto. The porphyry tombs of the Sassetti, in the chapel of\\nthat family, by Giuliano di Sangallo, are magnificent.\\n\\nIt is in the Sassetti chapel that we find the Ghirlandaio frescoes\\nof scenes in the life of S. Francis which bring so many strangers\\nto this church. The painting which depicts S. Francis receiving\\nthe charter from the Emperor Honorius is interesting both for its\\nhistory and its painting; for it contains a valuable record of what\\nthe Palazzo Vecchio and Loggia de' Lanzi were like in 1485, and also\\nmany portraits: among them Lorenzo the Magnificent, on the extreme\\nright holding out his hand: Poliziano, tutor of the Medici boys,\\ncoming first up the stairs; and on the extreme left very probably\\nVerrocchio, one of Ghirlandaio's favourite painters. We find old\\nFlorence again in the very attractive picture of the resuscitation\\nof the nice little girl in violet, a daughter of the Spini family,\\nwho fell from a window of the Spini palace (as we see in the distance\\non the left, this being one of the old synchronized scenes) and was\\nbrought to life by S. Francis, who chanced to be flying by. The\\nscene is intensely local: just outside the church, looking along\\nwhat is now the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0 and the old Trinit\\u00e0 bridge. The\\nSpini palace is still there, but is now called the Ferroni, and it\\naccommodates no longer Florentine aristocrats but consuls and bank\\nclerks. Among the portraits in the fresco are noble friends of the\\nSpini family -- Albrizzi, Acciaioli, Strozzi and so forth. The little\\ngirl is very quaint and perfectly ready to take up once more the\\nthreads of her life. How long she lived this second time and what\\nbecame of her I have not been able to discover. Her tiny sister,\\nbehind the bier, is even quainter. On the left is a little group\\nof the comely Florentine ladies in whom Ghirlandaio so delighted,\\ntall and serene, with a few youths among them.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that Ghirlandaio in his S. Trinit\\u00e0 frescoes\\nand Benedetto da Maiano in his S. Croce pulpit reliefs chose exactly\\nthe same scenes in the life of S. Francis: interesting because\\nwhen Ghirlandaio was painting frescoes at San Gimignano in 1475,\\nBenedetto was at work on the altar for the same church of S. Fina,\\nand they were friends. Where Ghirlandaio and Giotto, also in S. Croce,\\nalso coincide in choice of subject some interesting comparisons may\\nbe made, all to the advantage of Giotto in spiritual feeling and\\nunsophisticated charm, but by no means to Ghirlandaio's detriment\\nas a fascinating historian in colour. In the scene of the death of\\nS. Francis we find Ghirlandaio and Giotto again on the same ground,\\nand here it is probable that the later painter went to the earlier\\nfor inspiration; for he has followed Giotto in the fine thought that\\nmakes one of the attendant brothers glance up as though at the saint's\\nascending spirit. It is remarkable how, with every picture that one\\nsees, Giotto's completeness of equipment as a religious painter becomes\\nmore marked. His hand may have been ignorant of many masterly devices\\nfor which the time was not ripe; but his head and heart knew all.\\n\\nThe patriarchs in the spandrels of the choir are by Ghirlandaio's\\nmaster, Alessio Baldovinetti, of whom I said something in the chapter\\non S. Maria Novella. They once more testify to this painter's charm\\nand brilliance. Almost more than that of any other does one regret the\\nscarcity of his work. It was fitting that he should have painted the\\nchoir, for his name-saint, S. Alessio, guards the fa\\u00e7ade of the church.\\n\\nThe column opposite the church came from the baths of Caracalla and\\nwas set up by Cosimo I, upon the attainment of his life-long ambition\\nof a grand-dukeship and a crown. The figure at the top is Justice.\\n\\nS. Trinit\\u00e0 is a good starting-point for the leisurely examination of\\nthe older and narrower streets, an occupation which so many visitors\\nto Florence prefer to the study of picture galleries and churches. And\\nperhaps rightly. In no city can they carry on their researches with\\nsuch ease, for Florence is incurious about them. Either the Florentines\\nare too much engrossed in their own affairs or the peering foreigner\\nhas become too familiar an object to merit notice, but one may drift\\nabout even in the narrowest alleys beside the Arno, east and west,\\nand attract few eyes. And the city here is at its most romantic:\\nbetween the Piazza S. Trinit\\u00e0 and the Via Por S. Maria, all about\\nthe Borgo SS. Apostoli.\\n\\nWe have just been discussing Benedetto da Maiano the sculptor. If we\\nturn to the left on leaving S. Trinit\\u00e0, instead of losing ourselves in\\nthe little streets, we are in the Via Tornabuoni, where the best shops\\nare and American is the prevailing language. We shall soon come, on the\\nright, to an example of Benedetto's work as an architect, for the first\\ndraft of the famous Palazzo Strozzi, the four-square fortress-home\\nwhich Filippo Strozzi began for himself in 1489, was his. Benedetto\\ncontinued the work until his death in 1507, when Cronaca, who built\\nthe great hall in the Palazzo Vecchio, took it over and added the\\nfamous cornice. The iron lantern and other smithwork were by Lorenzo\\nthe Magnificent's sardonic friend, \\\"Il Caparro,\\\" of the Sign of the\\nBurning Books, of whom I wrote in the chapter on the Medici palace.\\n\\nThe first mistress of the Strozzi palace was Clarice Strozzi,\\nn\\u00e9e Clarice de' Medici, the daughter of Piero, son of Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent. She was born in 1493 and married Filippo Strozzi the\\nyounger in 1508, during the family's second period of exile. They\\nthen lived at Rome, but were allowed to return to Florence in\\n1510. Clarice's chief title to fame is her proud outburst when she\\nturned Ippolito and Alessandro out of the Medici palace. She died\\nin 1528 and was buried in S. Maria Novella. The unfortunate Filippo\\nmet his end nine years later in the Boboli fortezza, which his money\\nhad helped to build and in which he was imprisoned for his share in\\na conspiracy against Cosimo I. Cosimo confiscated the palace and all\\nStrozzi's other possessions, but later made some restitution. To-day\\nthe family occupy the upper part of their famous imperishable home,\\nand beneath there is an exhibition of pictures and antiquities for\\nsale. No private individual, whatever his wealth or ambition, will\\nprobably ever again succeed in building a house half so strong or\\nnoble as this.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nThe Pitti\\n\\nLuca Pitti's pride -- Preliminary caution -- A terrace view -- A\\ncollection but not a gallery -- The personally-conducted -- Giorgione\\nthe superb -- Sustermans -- The \\\"Madonna del Granduca\\\" -- The \\\"Madonna\\ndella Sedia\\\" -- From Cimabue to Raphael -- Andrea del Sarto -- Two Popes\\nand a bastard -- The ill-fated Ippolito -- The National Gallery -- Royal\\napartments -- \\\"Pallas Subduing the Centaur\\\" -- The Boboli Gardens.\\n\\nThe Pitti approached from the Via Guicciardini is far liker a prison\\nthan a palace. It was commissioned by Luca Pitti, one of the proudest\\nand richest of the rivals of the Medici, in 1441. Cosimo de' Medici,\\nas we have seen, had rejected Brunelleschi's plans for a palazzo\\nas being too pretentious and gone instead to his friend Michelozzo\\nfor something that externally at any rate was more modest; Pitti,\\nwhose one ambition was to exceed Cosimo in power, popularity, and\\nvisible wealth, deliberately chose Brunelleschi, and gave him carte\\nblanche to make the most magnificent mansion possible. Pitti, however,\\nplotting against Cosimo's son Piero, was frustrated and condemned to\\ndeath; and although Piero obtained his pardon he lost all his friends\\nand passed into utter disrespect in the city. Meanwhile his palace\\nremained unfinished and neglected, and continued so for a century,\\nwhen it was acquired by the Grand Duchess Eleanor of Toledo, the wife\\nof Cosimo I, who though she saw only the beginnings of its splendours\\nlived there awhile and there brought up her doomed brood. Eleanor's\\narchitect -- or rather Cosimo's, for though the Grand Duchess paid,\\nthe Grand Duke controlled -- was Ammanati, the designer of the Neptune\\nfountain in the Piazza della Signoria. Other important additions were\\nmade later. The last Medicean Grand Duke to occupy the Pitti was Gian\\nGastone, a bizarre detrimental, whose head, in a monstrous wig, may\\nbe seen at the top of the stairs leading to the Uffizi gallery. He\\ndied in 1737.\\n\\nAs I have said in chapter VIII, it was by the will of Gian Gastone's\\nsister, widow of the Elector Palatine, who died in 1743, that the\\nMedicean collections became the property of the Florentines. This\\nbequest did not, however, prevent the migration of many of the\\nbest pictures to Paris under Napoleon, but after Waterloo they came\\nback. The Pitti continued to be the home of princes after Gian Gastone\\nquitted a world which he found strange and made more so; but they were\\nnot of the Medici blood. It is now a residence of the royal family.\\n\\nThe first thing to do if by evil chance one enters the Pitti by the\\ncovered way from the Uffizi is, just before emerging into the palace,\\nto avoid the room where copies of pictures are sold, for not only is\\nit a very catacomb of headache, from the fresh paint, but the copies\\nare in themselves horrible and lead to disquieting reflections on\\nthe subject of sweated labour. The next thing to do, on at last\\nemerging, is to walk out on the roof from the little room at the\\ntop of the stairs, and get a supply of fresh air for the gallery,\\nand see Florence, which is very beautiful from here. Looking over\\nthe city one notices that the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio is almost\\nmore dominating than the Duomo, the work of the same architect who\\nbegan this palace. Between the two is Fiesole. The Signoria tower is,\\nas I say, the highest. Then the Duomo. Then Giotto's Campanile. The\\nBargello is hidden, but the graceful Badia tower is seen; also the\\nlittle white Baptistery roof with its lantern just showing. From the\\nfortezza come the sounds of drums and bugles.\\n\\nReturning from this terrace we skirt a vast porphyry basin and reach\\nthe top landing of the stairs (which was, I presume, once a loggia)\\nwhere there is a very charming marble fountain; and from this we\\nenter the first room of the gallery. The Pitti walls are so congested\\nand so many of the pictures so difficult to see, that I propose to\\nrefer only to those which, after a series of visits, seem to me the\\nabsolute best. Let me hasten to say that to visit the Pitti gallery\\non any but a really bright day is folly. The great windows (which\\nwere to be larger than Cosimo de' Medici's doors) are excellent to\\nlook out of, but the rooms are so crowded with paintings on walls\\nand ceilings, and the curtains are so absorbent of light, that unless\\nthere is sunshine one gropes in gloom. The only pictures in short that\\nare properly visible are those on screens or hinges; and these are,\\nfortunately almost without exception, the best. The Pitti rooms were\\nnever made for pictures at all, and it is really absurd that so many\\nbeautiful things should be massed here without reasonable lighting.\\n\\nThe Pitti also is always crowded. The Uffizi is never crowded; the\\nAccademia is always comfortable; the Bargello is sparsely attended. But\\nthe Pitti is normally congested, not only by individuals but by flocks,\\nwhose guides, speaking broken English, and sometimes broken American,\\nlead from room to room. I need hardly say that they form the tightest\\nknots before the works of Raphael. All this is proper enough, of\\ncourse, but it serves to render the Pitti a difficult gallery rightly\\nto study pictures in.\\n\\nIn the first chapter on the Uffizi I have said how simple it is,\\nin the Pitti, to name the best picture of all, and how difficult in\\nmost galleries. But the Pitti has one particular jewel which throws\\neverything into the background: the work not of a Florentine but of a\\nVenetian: \\\"The Concert\\\" of Giorgione, which stands on an easel in the\\nSala di Marte. It is true that modern criticism has doubted the\\nlightness of the ascription, and many critics, whose one idea seems\\nto be to deprive Giorgione of any pictures at all, leaving him but\\na glorious name without anything to account for it, call it an early\\nTitian; but this need not trouble us. There the picture is, and never\\ndo I think to see anything more satisfying. Piece by piece, it is\\nnot more than fine rich painting, but as a whole it is impressive and\\nmysterious and enchanting. Pater compares the effect of it to music;\\nand he is right.\\n\\nThe Sala dell' Iliade (the name of each room refers always to the\\nceiling painting, which, however, one quite easily forgets to look at)\\nis chiefly notable for the Raphael just inside the door: \\\"La Donna\\nGravida,\\\" No. 229, one of his more realistic works, with bolder colour\\nthan usual and harder treatment; rather like the picture that has\\nbeen made its pendant, No. 224, an \\\"Incognita\\\" by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio,\\nvery firmly painted, but harder still. Between them is the first of the\\nmany Pitti Andrea del Sartos: No. 225, an \\\"Assumption of the Madonna,\\\"\\nopposite a similar work from the same brush, neither containing quite\\nthe finest traits of this artist. But the youth with outstretched hand\\nat the tomb is nobly done. No. 265, \\\"Principe Mathias de' Medici,\\\"\\nis a good bold Sustermans, but No. 190, on the opposite wall, is a\\nfar better -- a most charming work representing the Crown Prince of\\nDenmark, son of Frederick III. Justus Sustermans, who has so many\\nportraits here and elsewhere in Florence, was a Belgian, born in 1597,\\nwho settled in Florence as a portrait painter to Cosimo III. Van Dyck\\ngreatly admired his work and painted him. He died at Florence in 1681.\\n\\nNo. 208, a \\\"Virgin Enthroned,\\\" by Fra Bartolommeo, is from S. Marco,\\nand it had better have been painted on the wall there, like the Fra\\nAngelicos, and then the convent would have it still. The Child is very\\nattractive, as almost always in this artist's work, but the picture\\nas a whole has grown rather dingy. By the window is a Velasquez, the\\nfirst we have seen in Florence, a little Philip IV on his prancing\\nsteed, rather too small for its subject, but very interesting here\\namong the Italians.\\n\\nIn the next large room -- the Sala di Saturno -- we come again to\\nRaphael, who is indeed the chief master of the Pitti, his exquisite\\n\\\"Madonna del Granduca\\\" being just to the left of the door. Here we\\nhave the simplest colouring and perfect sweetness, and such serenity\\nof mastery as must be the despair of the copyists, who, however,\\nnever cease attempting it. The only defect is a little clumsiness\\nin the Madonna's hand. The picture was lost for two centuries and it\\nthen changed owners for twelve crowns, the seller being a poor woman\\nand the buyer a bookseller. The bookseller found a ready purchaser\\nin the director of the Grand Duke Ferdinand III's gallery, and the\\nGrand Duke so esteemed it that he carried it with him on all his\\njourneys, just as Sir George Beaumont, the English connoisseur, never\\ntravelled without a favourite Claude. Hence its name. Another Andrea\\ndel Sarto, the \\\"Disputa sulla Trinita,\\\" No. 172, is close by, nobly\\ndrawn but again not of his absolute best, and then five more Raphaels\\nor putative Raphaels -- No. 171, Tommaso Inghirami; No. 61, Angelo Doni,\\nthe collector and the friend of artists, for whom Michelangelo painted\\nhis \\\"Holy Family\\\" in the Uffizi; No. 59, Maddalena Doni; and above\\nall No. 174, \\\"The Vision of Ezekiel,\\\" that little great picture,\\nso strong and spirited, and -- to coin a word -- Sixtinish. All these,\\nI may say, are questioned by experts; but some very fine hand is\\nto be seen in them any way. Over the \\\"Ezekiel\\\" is still another,\\nNo. 165, the \\\"Madonna detta del Baldacchino,\\\" which is so much better\\nin the photographs. Next this group -- No. 164 -- we find Raphael's\\nfriend Perugino with an Entombment, but it lacks his divine glow;\\nand above it a soft and mellow and easy Andrea del Sarto, No. 163,\\nwhich ought to be in a church rather than here. A better Perugino\\nis No. 42, which has all his sweetness, but to call it the Magdalen\\nis surely wrong; and close by it a rather formal Fra Bartolommeo,\\nNo. 159, \\\"Gesu Resuscitato,\\\" from the church of SS. Annunziata, in\\nwhich once again the babies who hold the circular landscape are the\\nbest part. After another doubtful Raphael -- the sly Cardinal Divizio\\nda Bibbiena, No. 158 -- let us look at an unquestioned one, No. 151,\\nthe most popular picture in Florence, if not the whole world, Raphael's\\n\\\"Madonna della Sedia,\\\" that beautiful rich scene of maternal tenderness\\nand infantine peace. Personally I do not find myself often under\\nRaphael's spell; but here he conquers. The Madonna again is without\\nenough expression, but her arms are right, and the Child is right,\\nand the colour is so rich, almost Venetian in that odd way in which\\nRaphael now and then could suggest Venice.\\n\\nIt is interesting to compare Raphael's two famous Madonnas in this\\nroom: this one belonging to his Roman period and the other, opposite\\nit, to Florence, with the differences so marked. For by the time he\\npainted this he knew more of life and human affection. This picture,\\nI suppose, might be called the consummation of Renaissance painting in\\nfullest bloom: the latest triumph of that impulse. I do not say it is\\nthe best; but it may be called a crown on the whole movement both in\\nsubject and treatment. Think of the gulf between the Cimabue Madonna\\nand the Giotto Madonna, side by side, which we saw in the Accademia,\\nand this. With so many vivid sympathies Giotto must have wanted with\\nall his soul to make the mother motherly and the child childlike; but\\nthe time was not yet; his hand was neither free nor fit. Between Giotto\\nand Raphael had to come many things before such treatment as this was\\npossible; most of all, I think, Luca della Robbia had to come between,\\nfor he was the most valuable reconciler of God and man of them all. He\\nwas the first to bring a tender humanity into the Church, the first\\nto know that a mother's fingers, holding a baby, sink into its soft\\nlittle body. Without Luca I doubt if the \\\"Madonna della Sedia\\\" could\\nbe the idyll of protective solicitude and loving pride that it is.\\n\\nThe Sala di Giove brings us to Venetian painting indeed, and glorious\\npainting too, for next the door is Titian's \\\"Bella,\\\" No. 18, the lady\\nin the peacock-blue dress with purple sleeves, all richly embroidered\\nin gold, whom to see once is to remember for ever. On the other side of\\nthe door is Andrea's brilliant \\\"S. John the Baptist as a Boy,\\\" No. 272,\\nand then the noblest Fra Bartolommeo here, a Deposition, No. 64, not\\ngood in colour, but superbly drawn and pitiful. In this room also is\\nthe monk's great spirited figure of S. Marco, for the convent of that\\nname. Between them is a Tintoretto, No. 131, Vincenzo Zeino, one of his\\nruddy old men, with a glimpse of Venice, under an angry sky, through\\nthe window. Over the door, No. 124, is an Annunciation by Andrea,\\nwith a slight variation in it, for two angels accompany that one who\\nbrings the news, and the announcement is made from the right instead\\nof the left, while the incident is being watched by some people on the\\nterrace over a classical portico. A greater Andrea hangs next: No. 123,\\nthe Madonna in Glory, fine but rather formal, and, like all Andrea's\\nwork, hall-marked by its woman type. The other notable pictures are\\nRaphael's Fornarina, No. 245, which is far more Venetian than the\\n\\\"Madonna della Sedia,\\\" and has been given to Sebastian del Piombo;\\nand the Venetian group on the right of the door, which is not only\\ninteresting for its own charm but as being a foretaste of the superb\\nand glorious Giorgione in the Sala di Marte, which we now enter.\\n\\nHere we find a Rembrandt, No. 16, an old man: age and dignity emerging\\ngolden from the gloom; and as a pendant a portrait, with somewhat\\nsimilar characteristics, but softer, by Tintoretto, No. 83. Between\\nthem is a prosperous, ruddy group of scholars by Rubens, who has\\nplaced a vase of tulips before the bust of Seneca. And we find Rubens\\nagain with a sprawling, brilliant feat entitled \\\"The Consequences\\nof War,\\\" but what those consequences are, beyond nakedness, one\\nhas difficulty in discerning. Raphael's Holy Family, No. 94 (also\\nknown as the \\\"Madonna dell' Impannata\\\"), next it might be called the\\nperfection of drawing without feeling. The authorities consider it a\\nschool piece: that is to say, chiefly the work of his imitators. The\\nvivacity of the Child's face is very remarkable. The best Andrea is\\nin this room -- a Holy Family, No. 81, which gets sweeter and simpler\\nand richer with every glance. Other Andreas are here too, notably on\\nthe right of the further door a sweet mother and sprawling, vigorous\\nChild. But every Andrea that I see makes me think more highly of the\\n\\\"Madonna della Sacco,\\\" in the cloisters of SS. Annunziata. Van Dyck,\\nwho painted much in Italy before settling down at the English court,\\nwe find in this room with a masterly full-length seated portrait of\\nan astute cardinal. But the room's greatest glory, as I have said,\\nis the Giorgione on the easel.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Apollo, at the right of the door as we enter, is\\nAndrea's portrait of himself, a serious and mysterious face shining\\nout of darkness, and below it is Titian's golden Magdalen, No. 67,\\nthe same ripe creature that we saw at the Uffizi posing as Flora,\\nagain diffusing Venetian light. On the other side of the door we find,\\nfor the first time in Florence, Murillo, who has two groups of the\\nMadonna and Child on this wall, the better being No. 63, which is both\\nsweet and masterly. In No. 56 the Child becomes a pretty Spanish boy\\nplaying with a rosary, and in both He has a faint nimbus instead of\\nthe halo to which we are accustomed. On the same wall is another fine\\nAndrea, who is most lavishly represented in this gallery, No. 58,\\na Deposition, all gentle melancholy rather than grief. The kneeling\\ngirl is very beautiful.\\n\\nFinally there are Van Dyck's very charming portrait of Charles\\nI of England and Henrietta, a most deft and distinguished work,\\nand Raphael's famous portrait of Leo X with two companions: rather\\ndingy, and too like three persons set for the camera, but powerful and\\ndeeply interesting to us, because here we see the first Medici pope,\\nLeo X, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni, who gave Michelangelo the\\ncommission for the Medici tombs and the new Sacristy of S. Lorenzo;\\nand in the young man on the Pope's right hand we see none other\\nthan Giulio, natural son of Giuliano de' Medici, Lorenzo's brother,\\nwho afterwards became Pope as Clement VII. It was he who laid siege\\nto Florence when Michelangelo was called upon to fortify it; and it\\nwas during his pontificate that Henry VIII threw off the shackles\\nof Rome and became the Defender of the Faith. Himself a bastard,\\nGiulio became the father of the base-born Alessandro of Urbino,\\nfirst Duke of Florence, who, after procuring the death of Ippolito\\nand living a life of horrible excess, was himself murdered by his\\ncousin Lorenzino in order to rid Florence of her worst tyrant. In\\nhis portrait Leo X has an illuminated missal and a magnifying glass,\\nas indication of his scholarly tastes. That he was also a good liver\\nhis form and features testify.\\n\\nOf this picture an interesting story is told. After the battle of\\nPavia, in 1525, Clement VII wishing to be friendly with the Marquis\\nof Gonzaga, a powerful ally of the Emperor Charles V, asked him what\\nhe could do for him, and Gonzaga expressed a wish for the portrait\\nof Leo X, then in the Medici palace. Clement complied, but wishing\\nto retain at any rate a semblance of the original, directed that the\\npicture should be copied, and Andrea del Sarto was chosen for that\\ntask. The copy turned out to be so close that Gonzaga never obtained\\nthe original at all.\\n\\nIn the next room -- the Sala di Venere, and the last room in the long\\nsuite -- we find another Raphael portrait, and another Pope, this time\\nJulius II, that Pontiff whose caprice and pride together rendered\\nnull and void and unhappy so many years of Michelangelo's life,\\nsince it was for him that the great Julian tomb, never completed, was\\ndesigned. A replica of this picture is in our National Gallery. Here\\nalso are a wistful and poignant John the Baptist by Dossi, No. 380;\\ntwo D\\u00fcrers -- an Adam and an Eve, very naked and primitive, facing\\neach other from opposite walls; and two Rubens landscapes not equal\\nto ours at Trafalgar Square, but spacious and lively. The gem of the\\nroom is a lovely Titian, No. 92, on an easel, a golden work of supreme\\nquietude and disguised power. The portrait is called sometimes the\\nDuke of Norfolk, sometimes the \\\"Young Englishman\\\".\\n\\nReturning to the first room -- the Sala of the Iliad -- we enter the Sala\\ndell' Educazione di Giove, and find on the left a little gipsy portrait\\nby Boccaccio Boccaccino (1497-1518) which has extraordinary charm:\\na grave, wistful, childish face in a blue handkerchief: quite a new\\nkind of picture here. I reproduce it in this volume, but it wants\\nits colour. For the rest, the room belongs to less-known and later\\nmen, in particular to Cristofano Allori (1577-1621), with his famous\\nJudith, reproduced in all the picture shops of Florence. This work is\\nno favourite of mine, but one cannot deny it power and richness. The\\nGuido Reni opposite, in which an affected fat actress poses as\\nCleopatra with the asp, is not, however, even tolerable.\\n\\nWe next pass, after a glance perhaps at the adjoining tapestry room\\non the left (where the bronze Cain and Abel are), the most elegant\\nbathroom imaginable, fit for anything rather than soap and splashes,\\nand come to the Sala di Ulisse and some good Venetian portraits:\\na bearded senator in a sable robe by Paolo Veronese, No. 216, and,\\nNo. 201, Titian's fine portrait of the ill-fated Ippolito de'\\nMedici, son of that Giuliano de' Medici, Duc de Nemours, whose\\ntomb by Michelangelo is at S. Lorenzo. This amiable young man was\\nbrought up by Leo X until the age of twelve, when the Pope died,\\nand the boy was sent to Florence to live at the Medici palace,\\nwith the base-born Alessandro, under the care of Cardinal Passerini,\\nwhere he remained until Clarice de' Strozzi ordered both the boys to\\nquit. In 1527 came the third expulsion of the Medici from Florence,\\nand Ippolito wandered about until Clement VII, the second Medici\\nPope, was in Rome, after the sack, and, joining him there, he was,\\nagainst his will, made a cardinal, and sent to Hungary: Clement's idea\\nbeing to establish Alessandro (his natural son) as Duke of Florence,\\nand squeeze Ippolito, the rightful heir, out. This, Clement succeeded\\nin doing, and the repulsive and squalid-minded Alessandro -- known as\\nthe Mule -- was installed. Ippolito, in whom this proceeding caused\\ndeep grief, settled in Bologna and took to scholarship, among other\\ntasks translating part of the Aeneid into Italian blank verse;\\nbut when Clement died and thus liberated Rome from a vile tyranny,\\nhe was with him and protected his corpse from the angry mob. That\\nwas in 1534, when Ippolito was twenty-seven. In the following year\\na number of exiles from Florence who could not endure Alessandro's\\noffensive ways, or had been forced by him to fly, decided to appeal\\nto the Emperor Charles V for assistance against such a contemptible\\nruler; and Ippolito headed the mission; but before he could reach the\\nEmperor an emissary of Alessandro's succeeded in poisoning him. Such\\nwas Ippolito de' Medici, grandson of the great Lorenzo, whom Titian\\npainted, probably when he was in Bologna, in 1533 or 1534.\\n\\nThis room also contains a nice little open decorative scene -- like a\\nsketch for a fresco -- of the Death of Lucrezia, No. 388, attributed\\nto the School of Botticelli, and above it a good Royal Academy Andrea\\ndel Sarto.\\n\\nThe next is the best of these small rooms -- the Sala of\\nPrometheus -- where on Sundays most people spend their time in\\nastonishment over the inlaid tables, but where Tuscan art also is\\nvery beautiful. The most famous picture is, I suppose, the circular\\nFilippino Lippi, No. 343, but although the lively background is\\nvery entertaining and the Virgin most wonderfully painted, the Child\\nis a serious blemish. The next favourite, if not the first, is the\\nPerugino on the easel -- No. 219 -- one of his loveliest small pictures,\\nwith an evening glow among the Apennines such as no other painter\\ncould capture. Other fine works here are the Fra Bartolommeo, No. 256,\\nover the door, a Holy Family, very pretty and characteristic, and his\\n\\\"Ecce Homo,\\\" next it; the adorable circular Botticini (as the catalogue\\ncalls it, although the photographers waver between Botticelli and\\nFilippino Lippi), No. 347, with its myriad roses and children with\\ntheir little folded hands and the Mother and Child diffusing happy\\nsweetness, which, if only it were a little less painty, would be one\\nof the chief magnets of the gallery.\\n\\nHereabout are many Botticelli school pictures, chief of these the\\ncurious girl, called foolishly \\\"La Bella Simonetta,\\\" which Mr. Berenson\\nattributes to that unknown disciple of Botticelli to whom he has given\\nthe charming name of Amico di Sandro. This study in browns, yellow,\\nand grey always has its public. Other popular Botticelli derivatives\\nare Nos. 348 and 357. Look also at the sly and curious woman (No. 102),\\nnear the window, by Ubertini, a new artist here; and the pretty Jacopo\\ndel Sellaio, No. 364; a finely drawn S. Sebastian by Pollaiuolo;\\nthe Holy Family by Jacopo di Boateri, No. 362, with very pleasant\\ncolouring; No. 140, the \\\"Incognita,\\\" which people used to think was\\nby Leonardo -- for some reason difficult to understand except on the\\nprinciple of making the wish father to the thought -- and is now given\\nto Bugiardini; and lastly a rich and comely example of Lombardy art,\\nNo. 299.\\n\\nFrom this room we will enter first the Corridio delle Colonne where\\nCardinal Leopoldo de' Medici's miniature portraits are hung, all\\nremarkable and some superb, but unfortunately not named, together\\nwith a few larger works, all very interesting. That Young Goldsmith,\\nNo. 207, which used to be given to Leonardo but is now Ridolfo\\nGhirlandaio's, is here; a Franciabigio, No. 43; a questioned Raphael,\\nNo. 44; a fine and sensitive head of one of the Gonzaga family by\\nMantegna, No. 375; the coarse head of Giovanni Bentivoglio by da\\nCosta, No. 376; and a Pollaiuolo, No. 370, S. Jerome, whose fine rapt\\ncountenance is beautifully drawn.\\n\\nIn the Sala della Giustizia we come again to the Venetians: a noble\\nPiombo, No. 409; the fine Aretino and Tommaso Mosti by Titian;\\nTintoretto's portrait of a man, No. 410; and two good Moronis. But\\nI am not sure that Dosso Dossi's \\\"Nymph and Satyr\\\" on the easel is\\nnot the most remarkable achievement here. I do not, however, care\\ngreatly for it.\\n\\nIn the Sala di Flora we find some interesting Andreas; a beautiful\\nportrait by Puligo, No. 184; and Giulio Romano's famous frieze of\\ndancers. Also a fine portrait by Allori, No. 72. The end room of all\\nis notable for a Ruysdael.\\n\\nFinally there is the Sala del Poccetti, out of the Sala di Prometeo,\\nwhich, together with the preceding two rooms that I have described,\\nhas lately been rearranged. Here now is the hard but masterly Holy\\nFamily of Bronzino, who has an enormous amount of work in Florence,\\nchiefly Medicean portraits, but nowhere, I think, reaches the level\\nof his \\\"Allegory\\\" in our National Gallery, or the portrait in the\\nTaylor collection sold at Christie's in 1912. Here also are four\\nrich Poussins; two typical Salvator Rosa landscapes and a battle\\npiece from the same hand; and, by some strange chance, a portrait\\nof Oliver Cromwell by Sir Peter Lely. But the stone table again wins\\nmost attention.\\n\\nAnd here, as we leave the last of the great picture collections of\\nFlorence, I would say how interesting it is to the returned visitor\\nto London to go quickly to the National Gallery and see how we\\ncompare with them. Florence is naturally far richer than we, but\\nalthough only now and then have we the advantage, we can valuably\\nsupplement in a great many cases. And the National Gallery keeps\\nup its quality throughout -- it does not suddenly fall to pieces as\\nthe Uffizi does. Thus, I doubt if Florence with all her Andreas\\nhas so exquisite a thing from his hand as our portrait of a \\\"Young\\nSculptor,\\\" so long called a portrait of the painter himself; and we\\nhave two Michelangelo paintings to the Uffizi's one. In Leonardo the\\nLouvre is of course far richer, even without the Gioconda, but we\\nhave at Burlington House the cartoon for the Louvre's S. Anne which\\nmay pair off with the Uffizi's unfinished Madonna, and we have also\\nat the National Gallery his finished \\\"Virgin of the Rocks,\\\" while\\nto Burlington House one must go too for Michelangelo's beautiful\\ntondo. In Piero di Cosimo we are more fortunate than the Uffizi; and\\nwe have Raphaels as important as those of the Pitti. We are strong\\ntoo in Perugino, Filippino Lippi, and Luca Signorelli, while when it\\ncomes to Piero della Francesca we lead absolutely. Our Verrocchio,\\nor School of Verrocchio, is a superb thing, while our Cimabue (from\\nS. Croce) has a quality of richness not excelled by any that I have\\nseen elsewhere. But in Botticelli Florence wins.\\n\\nThe Pitti palace contains also the apartments in which the King\\nand Queen of Italy reside when they visit Florence, which is not\\noften. Florence became the capital of Italy in 1865, on the day of\\nthe sixth anniversary of the birth of Dante. It remained the capital\\nuntil 1870, when Rome was chosen. The rooms are shown thrice a\\nweek, and are not, I think, worth the time that one must give to the\\nperambulation. Beyond this there is nothing to say, except that they\\nwould delight children. Visitors are hurried through in small bands,\\nand dallying is discouraged. Hence one is merely tantalized by the\\npresence of their greatest treasure, Botticelli's \\\"Pallas subduing\\nthe Centaur,\\\" painted to commemorate Lorenzo de' Medici's successful\\ndiplomatic mission to the King of Naples in 1480, to bring about\\nthe end of the war with Sixtus IV, the prime instigator of the Pazzi\\nConspiracy and the bitter enemy of Lorenzo in particular -- whose only\\nfault, as he drily expressed it, had been to \\\"escape being murdered\\nin the Cathedral\\\" -- and of all Tuscany in general. Botticelli, whom\\nwe have already seen as a Medicean allegorist, always ready with\\nhis glancing genius to extol and commend the virtues of that family,\\nhere makes the centaur typify war and oppression while the beautiful\\nfigure which is taming and subduing him by reason represents Pallas,\\nor the arts of peace, here identifiable with Lorenzo by the laurel\\nwreath and the pattern of her robe, which is composed of his private\\ncrest of diamond rings intertwined. This exquisite picture -- so rich\\nin colour and of such power and impressiveness -- ought to be removed\\nto an easel in the Pitti Gallery proper. The \\\"Madonna della Rosa,\\\"\\nby Botticelli or his School, is also here, and I had a moment before\\na very alluring Holbein. But my memory of this part of the palace is\\nmade up of gilt and tinsel and plush and candelabra, with two pieces\\nof furniture outstanding -- a blue and silver bed, and a dining table\\nrather larger than a lawn-tennis court.\\n\\nThe Boboli gardens, which climb the hill from the Pitti, are also\\nopened only on three afternoons a week. The panorama of Florence and\\nthe surrounding Apennines which one has from the Belvedere makes a\\nvisit worth while; but the gardens themselves are, from the English\\npoint of view, poor, save in extent and in the groves on the way to\\nthe stables (scuderie). Like all gardens where clipped walks are the\\nprincipal feature, they want people. They were made for people to\\nenjoy them, rather than for flowers to grow in, and at every turn\\nthere is a new and charming vista in a green frame.\\n\\nIt was from the Boboli hill-side before it was a garden that much\\nof the stone of Florence was quarried. With such stones so near it\\nis less to be wondered at that the buildings are what they are. And\\nyet it is wonderful too -- that these little inland Italian citizens\\nshould so have built their houses for all time. It proves them to\\nhave had great gifts of character. There is no such building any more.\\n\\nThe Grotto close to the Pitti entrance, which contains some of\\nMichelangelo's less remarkable \\\"Prisoners,\\\" intended for the great\\nJulian tomb, is so \\\"grottesque\\\" that the statues are almost lost, and\\naltogether it is rather an Old Rye House affair; and though Giovanni\\nda Bologna's fountain in the midst of a lake is very fine, I doubt if\\nthe walk is quite worth it. My advice rather is to climb at once to\\nthe top, at the back of the Pitti, by way of the amphitheatre where\\nthe gentlemen and ladies used to watch court pageants, and past that\\ningenious fountain above it, in which Neptune's trident itself spouts\\nwater, and rest in the pretty flower garden on the very summit of the\\nhill, among the lizards. There, seated on the wall, you may watch the\\npeasants at work in the vineyards, and the white oxen ploughing in\\nthe olive groves, in the valley between this hill and S. Miniato. In\\nspring the contrast between the greens of the crops and the silver\\ngrey of the olives is vivid and gladsome; in September, one may see\\nthe grapes being picked and piled into the barrels, immediately below,\\nand hear the squdge as the wooden pestle is driven into the purple\\nmass and the juice gushes out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nEnglish Poets in Florence\\n\\nCasa Guidi -- The Brownings -- Giotto's missing spire -- James Russell\\nLowell -- Lander's early life -- Fra Bartolommeo before Raphael -- The Tuscan\\ngardener -- The \\\"Villa Landor\\\" to-day -- Storms on the hillside -- Pastoral\\npoetry -- Italian memories in England -- The final outburst -- Last days\\nin Florence -- The old lion's beguilements -- The famous epitaph.\\n\\nOn a house in the Piazza S. Felice, obliquely facing the Pitti, with\\nwindows both in the Via Maggio and Via Mazzetta, is a tablet, placed\\nthere by grateful Florence, stating that it was the home of Robert\\nand of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and that her verse made a golden\\nring to link England to Italy. In other words, this is Casa Guidi.\\n\\nA third member of the family, Flush the spaniel, was also with them,\\nand they moved here in 1848, and it was here that Mrs. Browning\\ndied, in 1861. But it was not their first Florentine home, for in\\n1847 they had gone into rooms in the Via delle Belle Donne -- the\\nStreet of Beautiful Ladies -- whose name so fascinated Ruskin, near\\nS. Maria Novella. At Casa Guidi Browning wrote, among other poems,\\n\\\"Christinas Eve and Easter Day,\\\" \\\"The Statue and the Bust\\\" of which I\\nhave said something in chapter XIX, and the \\\"Old Pictures in Florence,\\\"\\nthat philosophic commentary on Vasari, which ends with the spirited\\nappeal for the crowning of Giotto's Campanile with the addition of\\nthe golden spire that its builder intended -- \\n\\n\\n Fine as the beak of a young beccaccia\\n The campanile, the Duomo's fit ally,\\n Shall soar up in gold full fifty braccia,\\n Completing Florence, as Florence Italy.\\n\\n\\nBut I suppose that the monologues \\\"Andrea del Sarto\\\" and \\\"Fra Lippo\\nLippi\\\" would be considered the finest fruit of Browning's Florentine\\nsojourn, as \\\"Casa Guidi Windows\\\" is of Mrs. Browning's. Her great poem\\nis indeed as passionate a plea for Italian liberty as anything by an\\nItalian poet. Here also she wrote much if not all of \\\"Aurora Leigh,\\\"\\n\\\"The Poems before Congress,\\\" and those other Italian political pieces\\nwhich when her husband collected them as \\\"Last Poems\\\" he dedicated\\n\\\"to 'grateful Florence'\\\".\\n\\nIn these Casa Guidi rooms the happiest days of both lives were\\nspent, and many a time have the walls resounded to the great voice,\\nlaughing, praising or condemning, of Walter Savage Landor; while the\\nshy Hawthorne has talked here too. Casa Guidi lodged not only the\\nBrownings, but, at one time, Lowell, who was not, however, a very\\ngood Florentine. \\\"As for pictures,\\\" I find him writing, in 1874,\\non a later visit, \\\"I am tired to death of 'em,... and then most of\\nthem are so bad. I like best the earlier ones, that say so much in\\ntheir half-unconscious prattle, and talk nature to me instead of\\nhigh art.\\\" But \\\"the older streets,\\\" he says, \\\"have a noble mediaeval\\ndistance and reserve for me -- a frown I was going to call it, not\\nof hostility, but of haughty doubt. These grim palace fronts meet\\nyou with an aristocratic start that puts you to the proof of your\\ncredentials. There is to me something wholesome in that that makes\\nyou feel your place.\\\"\\n\\nThe Brownings are the two English poets who first spring to mind\\nin connexion with Florence; but they had had very illustrious\\npredecessors. In August and September, 1638, during the reign\\nof Ferdinand II, John Milton was here, and again in the spring of\\n1639. He read Latin poems to fellow-scholars in the city and received\\ncomplimentary sonnets in reply. Here he met Galileo, and from here\\nhe made the excursion to Vallombrosa which gave him some of his most\\nfamous lines. He also learned enough of the language to write love\\npoetry to a lady in Bologna, although he is said to have offended\\nItalians generally by his strict morality.\\n\\nSkipping a hundred and eighty years we find Shelley in Florence,\\nin 1819, and it was here that his son was born, receiving the names\\nPercy Florence. Here he wrote, as I have said, his \\\"Ode to the West\\nWind\\\" and that grimly comic work \\\"Peter Bell the Third\\\".\\n\\nBut next the Brownings it is Walter Savage Landor of whom I always\\nthink as the greatest English Florentine. Florence became his second\\nhome when he was middle-aged and strong; and then again, when he was\\na very old man, shipwrecked by his impulsive and impossible temper,\\nit became his last haven. It was Browning who found him his final\\nresting-place -- a floor of rooms not far from where we now stand,\\nin the Via Nunziatina.\\n\\nFlorence is so intimately associated with Landor, and Landor was\\nso happy in Florence, that a brief outline of his life seems to\\nbe imperative. Born in 1775, the heir to considerable estates,\\nthe boy soon developed that whirlwind headstrong impatience which\\nwas to make him as notorious as his exquisite genius has made him\\nfamous. He was sent to Rugby, but disapproving of the headmaster's\\njudgment of his Latin verses, he produced such a lampoon upon him,\\nalso in Latin, as made removal or expulsion a necessity. At Oxford\\nhis Latin and Greek verses were still his delight, but he took\\nalso to politics, was called a mad Jacobin, and, in order to prove\\nhis sanity and show his disapproval of a person obnoxious to him,\\nfired a gun at his shutters and was sent down for a year. He never\\nreturned. After a period of strained relations with his father\\nand hot repudiations of all the plans for his future which were\\nmade for him -- such as entering the militia, reading law, and so\\nforth -- he retired to Wales on a small allowance and wrote \\\"Gebir\\\"\\nwhich came out in 1798, when its author was twenty-three. In 1808\\nLandor threw in his lot with the Spaniards against the French, saw\\nsome fighting and opened his purse for the victims of the war; but\\nthe usual personal quarrel intervened. Returning to England he bought\\nLlanthony Abbey, stocked it with Spanish sheep, planted extensively,\\nand was to be the squire of squires; and at the same time seeing a\\npretty penniless girl at a ball in Bath, he made a bet he would marry\\nher, and won it. As a squire he became quickly involved with neighbours\\n(an inevitable proceeding with him) and also with a Bishop concerning\\nthe restoration of the church. Lawsuits followed, and such expenses\\nand vexations occurred that Landor decided to leave England -- always\\na popular resource with his kind. His mother took over the estate\\nand allowed him an income upon which he travelled from place to\\nplace for a few years, quarrelling with his wife and making it up,\\nwriting Latin verses everywhere and on everything, and coming into\\ncollision not only with individuals but with municipalities.\\n\\nHe settled in Florence in 1821, finding rooms in the Palazzo Medici,\\nor, rather, Riccardi. There he remained for five years, which no doubt\\nwould have been a longer period had he not accused his landlord,\\nthe Marquis, who was then the head of the family, of seducing away\\nhis coachman. Landor wrote stating the charge; the Marquis, calling\\nin reply, entered the room with his hat on, and Landor first knocked\\nit off and then gave notice. It was at the Palazzo Medici that Landor\\nwas visited by Hazlitt in 1825, and here also he began the \\\"Imaginary\\nConversations,\\\" his best-known work, although it is of course such\\nbrief and faultless lyrics as \\\"Rose Aylmer\\\" and \\\"To Ianthe\\\" that have\\ngiven him his widest public.\\n\\nOn leaving the Palazzo, Landor acquired the Villa Gherardesca, on\\nthe hill-side below Fiesole, and a very beautiful little estate in\\nwhich the stream Affrico rises.\\n\\nCrabb Robinson, the friend of so many men of genius, who was in\\nFlorence in 1880, in rooms at 1341 Via della Nuova Vigna, met Landor\\nfrequently at his villa and has left his impressions. Landor had\\nmade up his mind to live and die in Italy, but hated the Italians. He\\nwould rather, he said, follow his daughter to the grave than to her\\nwedding with an Italian husband. Talking on art, he said he preferred\\nJohn of Bologna to Michelangelo, a statement he repeated to Emerson,\\nbut afterwards, I believe, recanted. He said also to Robinson that\\nhe would not give 1000 Pounds for Raphael's \\\"Transfiguration,\\\" but\\nten times that sum for Fra Bartolommeo's picture of S. Mark in the\\nPitti. Next to Raphael and Fra Bartolommeo he loved Perugino.\\n\\nLandor soon became quite the husbandman. Writing to his sisters in\\n1831, he says: \\\"I have planted 200 cypresses, 600 vines, 400 roses,\\n200 arbutuses, and 70 bays, besides laurustinas, etc., etc., and\\n60 fruit trees of the best qualities from France. I have not had\\na moment's illness since I resided here, nor have the children. My\\nwife runs after colds; it would be strange if she did not take them;\\nbut she has taken none here; hers are all from Florence. I have the\\nbest water, the best air, and the best oil in the world. They speak\\nhighly of the wine too; but here I doubt. In fact, I hate wine,\\nunless hock or claret....\\n\\n\\\"Italy is a fine climate, but Swansea better. That however is the\\nonly spot in Great Britain where we have warmth without wet. Still,\\nItaly is the country I would live in.... In two [years] I hope to\\nhave a hundred good peaches every day at table during two months:\\nat present I have had as many bad ones. My land is said to produce\\nthe best figs in Tuscany; I have usually six or seven bushels of them.\\\"\\n\\nI have walked through Lander's little paradise -- now called the Villa\\nLandor and reached by the narrow rugged road to the right just below\\nthe village of S. Domenico. Its cypresses, planted, as I imagine,\\nby Lander's own hand, are stately as minarets and its lawn is as\\ngreen and soft as that of an Oxford college. The orchard, in April,\\nwas a mass of blossom. Thrushes sang in the evergreens and the first\\nswallow of the year darted through the cypresses just as we reached\\nthe gates. It is truly a poet's house and garden.\\n\\nIn 1833 a French neighbour accused Landor of robbing him of water by\\nstopping an underground stream, and Landor naturally challenged him to\\na duel. The meeting was avoided through the tact of Lander's second,\\nthe English consul at Florence, and the two men became friends. At his\\nvilla Landor wrote much of his best prose -- the \\\"Pentameron,\\\" \\\"Pericles\\nand Aspasia\\\" and the \\\"Trial of Shakespeare for Deer-stealing \\\" -- and he\\nwas in the main happy, having so much planting and harvesting to do,\\nhis children to play with, and now and then a visitor. In the main\\ntoo he managed very well with the country people, but one day was\\namused to overhear a conversation over the hedge between two passing\\ncontadini. \\\"All the English are mad,\\\" said one, \\\"but as for this\\none...!\\\" There was a story of Landor current in Florence in those\\ndays which depicted him, furious with a spoiled dish, throwing his\\ncook out of the window, and then, realizing where he would fall,\\nexclaiming in an agony, \\\"Good God, I forgot the violets!\\\"\\n\\nSuch was Landor's impossible way on occasion that he succeeded in\\ngetting himself exiled from Tuscany; but the Grand Duke was called in\\nas pacificator, and, though the order of expulsion was not rescinded,\\nit was not carried out.\\n\\nIn 1835 Landor wrote some verses to his friend Ablett, who had lent\\nhim the money to buy the villa, professing himself wholly happy -- \\n\\n\\n Thou knowest how, and why, are dear to me\\n My citron groves of Fiesole,\\n My chirping Affrico, my beechwood nook,\\n My Naiads, with feet only in the brook,\\n Which runs away and giggles in their faces;\\n Yet there they sit, nor sigh for other places -- \\n\\n\\nbut later in the year came a serious break. Landor's relations with\\nMrs. Landor, never of such a nature as to give any sense of security,\\nhad grown steadily worse as he became more explosive, and they now\\nreached such a point that he flung out of the house one day and did\\nnot return for many years, completing the action by a poem in which\\nhe took a final (as he thought) farewell of Italy: -- \\n\\n\\n I leave thee, beauteous Italy! No more\\n From the high terraces, at even-tide,\\n To look supine into thy depths of sky,\\n The golden moon between the cliff and me,\\n Or thy dark spires of fretted cypresses\\n Bordering the channel of the milky way.\\n Fiesole and Valdarno must be dreams,\\n Hereafter, and my own lost Affrico\\n Murmur to me but the poet's song.\\n\\n\\nLandor gave his son Arnold the villa, settling a sum on his wife\\nfor the other children's maintenance, and himself returned to Bath,\\nwhere he added to his friends Sir William Napier (who first found\\na resemblance to a lion in Landor's features), John Forster, who\\nafterwards wrote his life, and Charles Dickens, who named a child\\nafter him and touched off his merrier turbulent side most charmingly\\nas Leonard Boythom in \\\"Bleak House\\\". But his most constant companion\\nwas a Pomeranian dog; in dogs indeed he found comfort all his life,\\nright to the end.\\n\\nLandor's love of his villa and estate finds expression again and again\\nin his verse written at this time. The most charming of all these\\ncharming poems -- the perfection of the light verse of a serious poet -- is\\nthe letter from England to his youngest boy, speculating on his\\nItalian pursuits. I begin at the passage describing the villa's cat: -- \\n\\n\\n Does Cincirillo follow thee about,\\n Inverting one swart foot suspensively,\\n And wagging his dread jaw at every chirp\\n Of bird above him on the olive-branch?\\n Frighten him then away! 'twas he who slew\\n Our pigeons, our white pigeons peacock-tailed,\\n That feared not you and me -- alas, nor him!\\n I flattened his striped sides along my knee,\\n And reasoned with him on his bloody mind,\\n Till he looked blandly, and half-closed his eyes\\n To ponder on my lecture in the shade.\\n I doubt his memory much, his heart a little,\\n And in some minor matters (may I say it?)\\n Could wish him rather sager. But from thee\\n God hold back wisdom yet for many years!\\n Whether in early season or in late\\n It always comes high-priced. For thy pure breast\\n I have no lesson; it for me has many.\\n Come throw it open then! What sports, what cares\\n (Since there are none too young for these) engage\\n Thy busy thoughts? Are you again at work,\\n Walter and you, with those sly labourers,\\n Geppo, Giovanni, Cecco, and Poeta,\\n To build more solidly your broken dam\\n Among the poplars, whence the nightingale\\n Inquisitively watch'd you all day long?\\n I was not of your council in the scheme,\\n Or might have saved you silver without end,\\n And sighs too without number. Art thou gone\\n Below the mulberry, where that cold pool\\n Urged to devise a warmer, and more fit\\n For mighty swimmers, swimming three abreast?\\n Or art though panting in this summer noon\\n Upon the lowest step before the hall,\\n Drawing a slice of watermelon, long\\n As Cupid's bow, athwart thy wetted lips\\n (Like one who plays Pan's pipe), and letting drop\\n The sable seeds from all their separate cells,\\n And leaving bays profound and rocks abrupt,\\n Redder than coral round Calypso's cave?\\n\\n\\nIn 1853 Landor put forth what he thought his last book, under the title\\n\\\"Last Fruit off an Old Tree\\\". Unhappily it was not his last, for in\\n1858 he issued yet one more, \\\"Dry Sticks faggotted by W. S. Landor,\\\"\\nin which was a malicious copy of verses reflecting upon a lady. He\\nwas sued for libel, lost the case with heavy damages, and once\\nmore and for the last time left England for Florence. He was now\\neighty-three. At first he went to the Villa Gherardesco, then the\\nhome of his son Arnold, but his outbursts were unbearable, and three\\ntimes he broke away, to be three times brought back. In July, 1859,\\nhe made a fourth escape, and then escaped altogether, for Browning\\ntook the matter in hand and established him, after a period in Siena,\\nin lodgings in the Via Nunziatina. From this time till his death in\\n1864 Landor may be said at last to have been at rest. He had found\\nsafe anchorage and never left it. Many friends came to see him, chief\\namong them Browning, who was at once his adviser, his admirer and his\\nshrewd observer. Landor, always devoted to pictures, but without much\\njudgment, now added to his collection; Browning in one of his letters\\nto Forster tells how he has found him \\\"particularly delighted by the\\nacquisition of three execrable daubs by Domenichino and Gaspar Poussin\\nmost benevolently battered by time\\\". Another friend says that he had\\na habit of attributing all his doubtful pictures to Corregoio. \\\"He\\ncannot,\\\" Browning continues, \\\"in the least understand that he is at\\nall wrong, or injudicious, or unfortunate in anything.... Whatever\\nhe may profess, the thing he really loves is a pretty girl to talk\\nnonsense with.\\\"\\n\\nOf the old man in the company of fair listeners we have glimpses\\nin the reminiscences of Mrs. Fields in the \\\"Atlantic Monthly\\\" in\\n1866. She also describes him as in a cloud of pictures. There with\\nhis Pomeranian Giallo within fondling distance, the poet, seated in\\nhis arm-chair, fired comments upon everything. Giallo's opinion was\\nasked on all subjects, and Landor said of him that an approving wag\\nof his tail was worth all the praise of all the \\\"Quarterlies \\\". It\\nwas Giallo who led to the profound couplet -- \\n\\n\\n He is foolish who supposes\\n Dogs are ill that have hot noses.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Fields tells how, after some classical or fashionable music had\\nbeen played, Landor would come closer to the piano and ask for an\\nold English ballad, and when \\\"Auld Robin Gray,\\\" his favourite of all,\\nwas sung, the tears would stream down his face. \\\"Ah, you don't know\\nwhat thoughts you are recalling to the troublesome old man.\\\"\\n\\nBut we have Browning's word that he did not spend much time in remorse\\nor regret, while there was the composition of the pretty little tender\\nepigrams of this last period to amuse him and Italian politics to\\nenchain his sympathy. His impulsive generosity led him to give his old\\nand trusted watch to the funds for Garibaldi's Sicilian expedition;\\nbut Browning persuaded him to take it again. For Garibaldi's wounded\\nprisoners he wrote an Italian dialogue between Savonarola and the\\nPrior of S. Marco. The death of Mrs. Browning in 1861 sent Browning\\nback to England, and Landor after that was less cheerful and rarely\\nleft the house. His chief solace was the novels of Anthony Trollope\\nand G.P.R. James. In his last year he received a visit from a young\\nEnglish poet and enthusiast for poetry, one Algernon Charles Swinburne,\\nwho arrived in time to have a little glowing talk with the old lion and\\nthus obtain inspiration for some fine memorial stanzas. On September\\n17th, 1864, Death found Landor ready -- as nine years earlier he had\\npromised it should -- \\n\\n\\nTo my ninth decade I have totter'd on,\\n And no soft arm bends now my steps to steady;\\nShe who once led me where she would, is gone,\\n So when he calls me, Death shall find me ready.\\n\\n\\nLandor was buried, as we saw, in the English cemetery within the city,\\nwhither his son Arnold was borne less than seven years later. Here is\\nhis own epitaph, one of the most perfect things in form and substance\\nin the English language: -- \\n\\n\\nI strove with none, for none was worth my strife,\\n Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;\\nI warmed both hands before the fire of life,\\n It sinks, and I am ready to depart.\\n\\n\\nIt should be cut on his tombstone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nThe Carmine and San Miniato\\n\\nThe human form divine and waxen -- Galileo -- Bianca Capella -- A\\nfaithful Grand Duke -- S.

Many visitors to\\nFlorence never even hear of it and one quickly finds that its chief\\nfrequenters are the poor. All the better for that. Here not only is\\nthe whole animal kingdom spread out before the eye in crowded cases,\\nbut the most wonderful collection of wax reproductions of the human\\nform is to be seen. These anatomical models are so numerous and so\\nexact that, since the human body does not change with the times,\\na medical student could learn everything from them in the most\\ngentlemanly way possible. But they need a strong stomach. Mine,\\nI confess, quailed before the end.\\n\\nThe hero of the Museum is Galileo, whose tomb at S. Croce we have seen:\\nhere are preserved certain of his instruments in a modern, floridly\\ndecorated Tribuna named after him. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) belongs\\nrather to Pisa, where he was born and where he found the Leaning Tower\\nuseful for experiments, and to Rome, where in 1611 he demonstrated\\nhis discovery of the telescope; but Florence is proud of him and it\\nwas here that he died, under circumstances tragic for an astronomer,\\nfor he had become totally blind.\\n\\nThe frescoes in the Tribuna celebrate other Italian scientific\\ntriumphs, and in the cases are historic telescopes, astrolabes,\\nbinoculars, and other mysteries.\\n\\nThe Via Maggio, which runs from Casa Guidi to the Ponte Trinita, and\\nat noon is always full of school-girls, brings us by way of the Via\\nMichelozzo to S. Spirito, but by continuing in it we pass a house of\\ngreat interest, now No. 26, where once lived the famous Bianca Capella,\\nthat beautiful and magnetic Venetian whom some hold to have been so\\nvile and others so much the victim of fate. Bianca Capella was born in\\n1543, when Francis I, Cosimo I's eldest son, afterwards to play such a\\npart in her life, was two years of age. While he was being brought up\\nin Florence, Bianca was gaining loveliness in her father's palace. When\\nshe was seventeen she fell in love with a young Florentine engaged\\nin a bank in Venice, and they were secretly married. Her family\\nwere outraged by the m\\u00e9salliance and the young couple had to flee\\nto Florence, where they lived in poverty and hiding, a prize of 2000\\nducats being offered by the Capella family to anyone who would kill\\nthe husband; while, by way of showing how much in earnest they were,\\nthey had his uncle thrown into prison, where he died.\\n\\nOne day the unhappy Bianca was sitting at her window when the young\\nprince Francis was passing: he looked up, saw her, and was enslaved on\\nthe spot. (The portraits of Bianca do not, I must admit, lay emphasis\\non this story. Titian's I have not seen; but there is one by Bronzino\\nin our National Gallery -- No. 650 -- and many in Florence.) There was,\\nhowever, something in Bianca's face to which Francis fell a victim, and\\nhe brought about a speedy meeting. At first Bianca repulsed him; but\\nwhen she found that her husband was unworthy of her, she returned the\\nPrince's affection. (I am telling her story from the pro-Bianca point\\nof view: there are plenty of narrators on the other side.) Meanwhile,\\nFrancis's official life going on, he married that archduchess Joanna\\nof Austria for whom the Austrian frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio were\\npainted; but his heart remained Bianca's and he was more at her house\\nthan in his own. At last, Bianca's husband being killed in some fray,\\nshe was free from the persecution of her family and ready to occupy\\nthe palace which Francis hastened to build for her, here, in the Via\\nMaggio, now cut up into tenements at a few lire a week. The attachment\\ncontinued unabated when Francis came to the throne, and upon the death\\nof his archduchess in 1578 Bianca and he were almost immediately,\\nbut privately, married, she being then thirty-five; and in the next\\nyear they were publicly married in the church of S. Lorenzo with every\\ncircumstance of pomp; while later in the same year Bianca was crowned.\\n\\nFrancis remained her lover till his death, which was both dramatic\\nand suspicious, husband and wife dying within a few hours of each\\nother at the Medici villa of Poggia a Caiano in 1587. Historians\\nhave not hesitated to suggest that Francis was poisoned by his wife;\\nbut there is no proof. It is indeed quite possible that her life\\nwas more free of intrigue, ambition and falsehood, than that of any\\none about the court at that time; but the Florentines, encouraged by\\nFrancis's brother Ferdinand I, who succeeded him, made up their minds\\nthat she was a witch, and few things in the way of disaster happened\\nthat were not laid to her charge. Call a woman a witch and everything\\nis possible. Ferdinand not only detested Bianca in life and deplored\\nher fascination for his brother, but when she died he refused to allow\\nher to be buried with the others of the family; hence the Chapel of\\nthe Princes at S. Lorenzo lacks one archduchess. Her grave is unknown.\\n\\nThe whole truth we shall never know; but it is as easy to think of\\nBianca as a harmless woman who both lost and gained through love as\\nto picture her as sinister and scheming. At any rate we know that\\nFrancis was devoted to her with a fidelity and persistence for which\\nGrand Dukes have not always been conspicuous.\\n\\nS. Spirito is one of Brunelleschi's solidest works. Within it resembles\\nthe city of Bologna in its vistas of brown and white arches. The\\neffect is severe and splendid; but the church is to be taken rather\\nas architecture than a treasury of art, for although each of its\\neight and thirty chapels has an altar picture and several have fine\\npieces of sculpture -- one a copy of Michelangelo's famous Pieta in\\nRome -- there is nothing of the highest value. It was in this church\\nthat I was asked alms by one of the best-dressed men in Florence;\\nbut the Florentine beggars are not importunate: they ask, receive or\\nare denied, and that is the end of it.\\n\\nThe other great church in the Pitti quarter is the Carmine, and here\\nwe are on very sacred ground in art -- for it was here, as I have had\\noccasion to say more than once in this book, that Masaccio painted\\nthose early frescoes which by their innovating boldness turned the\\nBrancacci chapel into an Academy. For all the artists came to study\\nand copy them: among others Michelangelo, whose nose was broken by\\nthe turbulent Torrigiano, a fellow-student, under this very roof.\\n\\nTommaso di Ser Giovanni, or Masaccio, the son of a notary, was born\\nin 1402. His master is not known, but Tommaso Fini or Masolino,\\nborn in 1383, is often named. Vasari states that as a youth Masaccio\\nhelped Ghiberti with his first Baptistery doors; and if so, the fact\\nis significant. But all that is really known of his early life is\\nthat he went to Rome to paint a chapel in S. Clemente. He returned,\\napparently on hearing that his patron Giovanni de' Medici was in\\npower again. Another friend, Brunelleschi, having built the church\\nof S. Spirito in 1422, Masaccio began to work there in 1423, when he\\nwas only twenty-one.\\n\\nMasaccio's peculiar value in the history of painting is his early\\ncombined power of applying the laws of perspective and representing\\nhuman beings \\\"in the round\\\". Giotto was the first and greatest\\ninnovator in painting -- the father of real painting; Masaccio was the\\nsecond. If from Giotto's influence a stream of vigour had flowed such\\nas flowed from Masaccio's, there would have been nothing special to\\nnote about Masaccio at all. But the impulse which Giotto gave to art\\ndied down; some one had to reinvigorate it, and that some one was\\nMasaccio. In his remarks on painting, Leonardo da Vinci sums up the\\nachievements of the two. They stood out, he says, from the others\\nof their time, by reason of their wish to go to life rather than to\\npictures. Giotto went to life, his followers went to pictures; and\\nthe result was a decline in art until Masaccio, who again went to life.\\n\\nFrom the Carmine frescoes came the new painting. It is not that walls\\nhenceforth were covered more beautifully or suitably than they had\\nbeen by Giotto's followers; probably less suitably very often; but\\nthat religious symbolism without much relation to actual life gave\\nway to scenes which might credibly have occurred, where men, women\\nand saints walked and talked much as we do, in similar surroundings,\\nwith backgrounds of cities that could be lived in and windows that\\ncould open. It was this revolution that Masaccio performed. No doubt\\nif he had not, another would, for it had to come: the new demand was\\nthat religion should be reconciled with life.\\n\\nIt is generally supposed that Masaccio had Masolino as his ally in\\nthis wonderful series; and a vast amount of ink has been spilt over\\nMasolino's contributions. Indeed the literature of expert art criticism\\non Florentine pictures alone is of alarming bulk and astonishing in\\nits affirmations and denials. The untutored visitor in the presence\\nof so much scientific variance will be wise to enact the part of\\nthe lawyer in the old caricature of the litigants and the cow, who,\\nwhile they pull, one at the head and the other at the tail, fills\\nhis bucket with milk. In other words, the plain duty of the ordinary\\nperson is to enjoy the picture.\\n\\nWithout any special knowledge of art one can, by remembering the\\nearly date of these frescoes, realize what excitement they must have\\ncaused in the studios and how tongues must have clacked in the Old\\nMarket. We have but to send our thoughts to the Spanish chapel at\\nS. Maria Novella to realize the technical advance. Masaccio, we see,\\nwas peopling a visible world; the Spanish chapel painters were merely\\nallegorizing, as agents of holiness. The Ghirlandaio choir in the same\\nchurch would yield a similar comparison; but what we have to remember\\nis that Ghirlandaio painted these frescoes in 1490, sixty-two years\\nafter Masaccio's death, and Masaccio showed him how.\\n\\nIt is a pity that the light is so poor and that the frescoes have\\nnot worn better; but their force and dramatic vigour remain beyond\\ndoubt. The upper scene on the left of the altar is very powerful: the\\nRoman tax collector has asked Christ for a tribute and Christ bids\\nPeter find the money in the mouth of a fish. Figures, architecture,\\nlandscape, all are in right relation; and the drama is moving, without\\nrestlessness. This and the S. Peter preaching and distributing alms\\nare perhaps the best, but the most popular undoubtedly is that below\\nit, finished many years after by Filippino Lippi (although there are\\nexperts to question this and even substitute his amorous father), in\\nwhich S. Peter, challenged by Simon Magus, resuscitates a dead boy,\\njust as S. Zenobius used to do in the streets of this city. Certain\\nmore modern touches, such as the exquisite Filippino would naturally\\nhave thought of, may be seen here: the little girl behind the boy,\\nfor instance, who recalls the children in that fresco by the same\\nhand at S. Maria Novella in which S. John resuscitates Drusiana. In\\nthis Carmine fresco are many portraits of Filippino's contemporaries,\\nincluding Botticelli, just as in the scene of the consecration of\\nthe Carmine which Masaccio painted in the cloisters, but which has\\nalmost perished, he introduced Brancacci, his employer, Brunelleschi,\\nDonatello, some of whose innovating work in stone he was doing in\\npaint, Giovanni de' Medici and Masolino. The scanty remains of this\\nfresco tell us that it must have been fine indeed.\\n\\nMasaccio died at the early age of twenty-six, having suddenly\\ndisappeared from Florence, leaving certain work unfinished. A strange\\nportentous meteor in art.\\n\\nThe Pitti side of the river is less interesting than the other,\\nbut it has some very fascinating old and narrow streets, although\\nthey are less comfortable for foreigners to wander in than those,\\nfor example, about the Borgo SS. Apostoli. They are far dirtier.\\n\\nFrom the Pitti end of the Ponte Vecchio one can obtain a most charming\\nwalk. Turn to the left as you leave the bridge, under the arch made by\\nCosimo's passage, and you are in the Via de' Bardi, the backs of whose\\nhouses on the river-side are so beautiful from the Uffizi's central\\narches, as Mr. Morley's picture shows. At the end of the street is\\nan archway under a large house. Go through this, and you are at the\\nfoot of a steep, stone hill. It is really steep, but never mind. Take\\nit easily, and rest half-way where the houses on the left break and\\ngive a wonderful view of the city. Still climbing, you come to the\\nbest gate of all that is left -- a true gate in being an inlet into a\\nfortified city -- that of S. Giorgio, high on the Boboli hill by the\\nfort. The S. Giorgio gate has a S. George killing a dragon, in stone,\\non its outside, and the saint painted within, Donatello's conception\\nof him being followed by the artist. Parsing through, you are in the\\ncountry. The fort and gardens are on one side and villas on the other;\\nand a great hill-side is in front, covered with crops. Do not go on,\\nbut turn sharp to the left and follow the splendid city wall, behind\\nwhich for a long way is the garden of the Villa Karolath, one of the\\nchoicest spots in Florence, occasionally tossing its branches over the\\ntop. This wall is immense all the way down to the Porta S. Miniato,\\nand two of the old towers are still standing in their places upon\\nit. Botticini's National Gallery picture tells exactly how they looked\\nin their heyday. Ivy hangs over, grass and flowers spring from the\\nancient stones, and lizards run about. Underneath are olive-trees.\\n\\nIt was, by the way, in the Via de' Bardi that George Eliot's\\nRomola lived, for she was of the Bardi family. The story, it may be\\nremembered, begins on the morning of Lorenzo the Magnificent's death,\\nand ends after the execution of Savonarola. It is not an inspired\\nromance, and is remarkable almost equally for its psychological\\nomissions and the convenience of its coincidences, but it is an\\nexcellent preparation for a first visit in youth to S. Marco and the\\nPalazzo Vecchio, while the presence in its somewhat naive pages of\\ncertain Florentine characters makes it agreeable to those who know\\nsomething of the city and its history. The painter Piero di Cosimo,\\nfor example, is here, straight from Vasari; so also are Cronaca, the\\narchitect, Savonarola, Capparo, the ironsmith, and even Machiavelli;\\nwhile Bernardo del Nero, the gonfalonier, whose death sentence\\nSavonarola refused to revise, was Romola's godfather.\\n\\nThe Via Guicciardini, which runs from the foot of the Via de' Bardi\\nto the Pitti, is one of the narrowest and busiest Florentine streets,\\nwith an undue proportion of fruit shops overflowing to the pavement\\nto give it gay colouring. At No. 24 is a stable with pillars and\\narches that would hold up a pyramid. But this is no better than most\\nof the old stables of Florence, which are all solid vaulted caverns\\nof immense size and strength.\\n\\nFrom the Porta Romana one may do many things -- take the tram,\\nfor example, for the Certosa of the Val d'Ema, which is only some\\ntwenty minutes distant, or make a longer journey to Impruneta, where\\nthe della Robbias are. But just now let us walk or ride up the long\\nwinding Viale Macchiavelli, which curves among the villas behind the\\nBoboli Gardens, to the Piazzale Michelangelo and S. Miniato.\\n\\nThe Piazzale Michelangelo is one of the few modern tributes of Florence\\nto her illustrious makers. The Dante memorial opposite S. Croce is\\nanother, together with the preservation of certain buildings with\\nDante associations in the heart of the city; but, as I have said more\\nthan once, there is no piazza in Florence, and only one new street,\\nnamed after a Medici. From the Piazzale Michelangelo you not only\\nhave a fine panoramic view of the city of this great man -- in its\\nprincipal features not so vastly different from the Florence of his\\nday, although of course larger and with certain modern additions,\\nsuch as factory chimneys, railway lines, and so forth -- but you can see\\nthe remains of the fortifications which he constructed in 1529, and\\nwhich kept the Imperial troops at bay for nearly a year. Just across\\nthe river rises S. Croce, where the great man is buried, and beyond,\\nover the red roofs, the dome of the Medici chapel at S. Lorenzo shows\\nus the position of the Biblioteca Laurenziana and the New Sacristy,\\nboth built by him. Immediately below us is the church of S. Niccolo,\\nwhere he is said to have hidden in 1529, when there was a hue and\\ncry for him. In the middle of this spacious plateau is a bronze\\nreproduction of his David, and it is good to see it, from the cafe\\nbehind it, rising head and shoulders above the highest Apennines.\\n\\nS. Miniato, the church on the hill-top above the Piazzale Michelangelo,\\ndeserves many visits. One may not be too greatly attached to marble\\nfa\\u00e7ades, but this little temple defeats all prejudices by its radiance\\nand perfection, and to its extraordinary charm its situation adds. It\\ncrowns the hill, and in the late afternoon -- the ideal time to visit\\nit -- is full in the eye of the sun, bathed in whose light the green\\nand white fa\\u00e7ade, with miracles of delicate intarsia, is balm to the\\neyes instead of being, as marble so often is, dazzling and cold.\\n\\nOn the way up we pass the fine church of S. Salvatore, which Cronaca\\nof the Palazzo Vecchio and Palazzo Strozzi built and Michelangelo\\nadmired, and which is now secularized, and pass through the gateway of\\nMichelangelo's upper fortifications. S. Miniato is one of the oldest\\nchurches of Florence, some of it eleventh century. It has its name\\nfrom Minias, a Roman soldier who suffered martyrdom at Florence under\\nDecius. Within, one does not feel quite to be in a Christian church,\\nthe effect partly of the unusual colouring, all grey, green, and gold\\nand soft light tints as of birds' bosoms; partly of the ceiling,\\nwhich has the bright hues of a Russian toy; partly of the forest\\nof great gay columns; partly of the lovely and so richly decorated\\nmarble screen; and partly of the absence of a transept. The prevailing\\nfeeling indeed is gentle gaiety; and in the crypt this is intensified,\\nfor it is just a joyful assemblage of dancing arches.\\n\\nThe church as a whole is beautiful and memorable enough; but\\nits details are wonderful too, from the niello pavement, and\\nthe translucent marble windows of the apse, to the famous tomb of\\nCardinal Jacopo of Portugal, and the Luca della Robbia reliefs of the\\nVirtues. This tomb is by Antonio Rossellino. It is not quite of the\\nrank of Mino's in the Badia; but it is a noble and beautiful thing\\nmarked in every inch of it by modest and exquisite thought. Vasari\\nsays of Antonio that he \\\"practised his art with such grace that\\nhe was valued as something more than a man by those who knew him,\\nwho well-nigh adored him as a saint\\\". Facing it is a delightful\\nAnnunciation by Alessio Baldovinetti, in which the angel declares the\\nnews from a far greater distance than we are accustomed to; and the\\nceiling is made an abode of gladness by the blue and white figures\\n(designed by Luca della Robbia) of Prudence and Chastity, Moderation\\nand Fortitude, for all of which qualities, it seems, the Cardinal was\\nfamous. In short, one cannot be too glad that, since he had to die,\\ndeath's dart struck down this Portuguese prelate while he was in\\nRossellino's and Luca's city.\\n\\nNo longer is preserved here the miraculous crucifix which, standing\\nin a little chapel in the wood on this spot, bestowed blessing and\\npardon -- by bending towards him -- upon S. Giovanni Gualberto, the founder\\nof the Vallombrosan order. The crucifix is now in S. Trinita.

Students, poets, and painters have combined in reproducing her many charms. Usually, however, Venice is described in a hurried, careless way: the subject is seldom gone deeply into, and studied as it should be, before attempting to compile a book. It is only one who has been there, and observed the life and characteristics of the people for years, who can gain any true perception of their character. Those who have not been to Venice must needs know by heart her attractions, which have been so persistently thrust before the public; but unless half a dozen really excellent books have been read concerning her, the city of their imaginations must be a theatrical Venice, unreal and altogether false. Normally one feels that the last word about Venice has been said - the last chord struck upon her keyboard, the last harmony brought out. But this is by no means the case. There are chords still to be struck, and harmonies still to be brought out: her charm can never be exhausted. The last chord struck, no matter how poorly executed it may be, goes on vibrating in our ears, and all unconsciously we are listening for another. How strange this is! Why should it be so? What other cities impress us in the same way? Oxford perhaps, and Rome certainly. These are the only two which come to my mind at the moment. They are the cities of the soul, round which endless romantic histories cling, endless dear and glorious associations. Perhaps the reason why one never tires of books on Venice, or of pictures of Venice, is that they none of them fulfil one's desires and expectations - they never express just what one feels about her - there is always something left unsaid, something uninterpreted; and one is always waiting for that. It is impossible to express all one feels with regard to Venice. One feels one's own incompetence terribly. Try as you may, you can only give one day, one hour, one aspect of sea and sky, only the four seasons, not all the myriad changes between; - only four times of the day - dawn, mid-day, twilight, and night - not the thousand melting changes, not the continual variations. It is not a panorama, not a magnificent view permanent before one's gaze. The cloud forms will never be quite the same as you see them at a certain moment; the water will never be again of that particular shade of green; the reflection of a pink palace, with the black barge at its base laden with golden fruit, will never again be thrown upon the water quite in that same way; there will not always be that warm golden light bathing sea and sky and palace; that particular pearly-grey mist in the early morning will never recur, never quite that deep blue-black of night with the orange lights and the steely water. When one lives in Venice one becomes absolutely in sympathy with the place. One feels her beautiful colour; but it is quite another story when one comes to reproduce it. Words cannot describe nor brush portray it. Thousands have attempted to paint Venice; but few have succeeded. The Venetians themselves, loving their country, painted her continually; but even they could only give one aspect of her. The pictures of Venice by Venetian masters are chiefly of her pomp and glory, her State functions and her water f\\u00eates. However, one finds marvellous glimpses of landscape work in some of the great masterpieces - sweeps of sky above the heads of some of the Madonnas, skies in which one can feel the shimmer of light so characteristic of Venice, the blending of the tones and the flaming glory of the sunset sky. Turner, too, caught the radiant, shimmering, bright and opalescent qualities of the lagoon scenery; but even his palette could not cope with the ever-changing colour. One must be either hot or cold with regard to Venice. You cannot be lukewarm. The magic of her spell begins to work upon you immediately you arrive. Most of us imagine what the place will be like before we reach it. We people it in our dreams, and visualise it for ourselves - canals, palaces, streets, the general appearance of things. This imaginary city has no foundations save those which are supplied by pictures and stories. One's first impressions are always those which one remembers longest, and one's first impressions of Venice are surpassingly beautiful. In the train, arriving, you catch glimpses of flashes of light in the darkness, more strangely fantastic than anything you could imagine; you traverse a long causeway stretching over the lagoon; you see the water on either side of you, jet black, stretching on indefinitely; the train seems to float on air; you cannot see the bridge - nothing but sky and water. You arrive at a large terminal station, and step into the gondola which is to take you into Venice. Into most cities one arrives in a whirl and shriek of engines amid smoke and bustle; but Venice is different. One arrives in a gondola. The water is of a clear pale green; the banks are scrubby grass and mud. One watches the silver prow of the gondola as it shoots forward, the sea air blowing keen and salt. You realise that you are in a wide canal, and that there are buildings on either side of you, looming up white and gaunt, with here and there a lantern glimmering at their base. It is strange to see a city rising thus out of the sea. Venice seems double: one sees it in the substance and in the reflections on the water. After gliding along for some time you turn up narrow water lanes, devious and branching, running by low stonework, very complicated in their turnings. There are doors with water creeping up their steps, striped posts looking like spectres, and arches everywhere. Strange figures, like phantoms in a dream, appear in the gloom; black gondolas, like funeral biers, lie silently at the base of the houses; and the water laps dully at the steps. The silence of the waterways is deathlike after the rush and noise of a long journey; each shape that passes looks ghostly in the dim light; it is like a city of eternal sleep, a city of death. What a perfect background it would make for melodrama or for tragedy! No crime or intrigue could be too terrible to happen within those unfathomable shadows! A brigand might pass within that heavy half-opened oak door silently and unnoticed. A corpse with a stiletto buried in its breast might be gliding by in that black gondola. One would be quite surprised and somewhat shocked on lifting the felce to discover a fat and florid tradesman returning from supper with a friend. Venice is not a fitting background for such a sordid everyday scene. She is much better suited to the romances of Maturin, Lewis, and Ann Radcliffe; to the Great Bandit, the stories of the Three Inquisitors, the Council of Ten, masked spies, and pitfalls. In the daytime one recognises Venice as the Venice of Canaletto, of Bonington, and of Wild. There is that same vague, luminous atmosphere, full of rays and mists; the coming and going of gondolas or galiots; the landing-place of the Piazzetta, with its Gothic lanterns ornamented by figures of the saints, fixed on poles and sunk into the sea; the vermilion fa\\u00e7ade of the Ducal Palace, lozenged with white and rose marble, its massive pillars supporting a gallery of small columns. With all this one has been familiar through the pictures of the masters whom I have mentioned; but the real Venice is still more beautiful, still more wonderful, still more fantastic. If you climb up on any height and look down upon the lagoon, you will see a sight never to be forgotten. You will imagine that it is a dream which has taken shape, a vision of fairy-land. The sea is dotted with craft of all kinds. There is a continuous movement of boats - gondolas, sailing vessels, and steam-boats pouring forth volumes of black smoke and making a disturbance on the peaceful lagoon. The water is limpid, the light radiant; a row of stakes on the lagoon marks the channels which are navigable for ships. There is the island of San Giorgio, with its red steeple, its white basilica, surrounded by a girdle of boats, and looking like a sheet of burnished silver. There is the Giudecca, a maritime suburb of Venice, turning towards the city a row of houses and towards the sea a belt of gardens; it has two churches, Santa Maria and the Redentore. There is San Clemate, at the back of the Giudecca, a place of penitence and of detention for priests under discipline; Poreglia, where the vessels are quarantined; and the little island of St. Peter, almost invisible in the distance. The only black cupola is that of St. Simeon the Less. Those of the other churches are silvery. The clouds and the islands seem to mingle one with the other, and are as baffling as the mirage in a desert. On a fine day in Venice there is a certain brilliant crystalline clearness sharpening every outline; every tower and dome stands out sharp and clear against the sky, making the colours burn. There is colour everywhere: even the islands in the distance are blue and distinct. There is colour in the groups that saunter by, in the sapphire water, and in the cloudless heavens. The air is warm and still; the streets are full of people, walking and loitering at the doors of the shops; sunbeams dance on the rippling water; spring is everywhere. As evening comes on the colours grow richer and deeper; scarlet clouds float across the amber sky; the canal takes on the hues of the upper air, and is a rippling mass of liquid topaz and molten gold, in rapid succession changing from gold to orange, and from orange to deepest crimson. In the soft hazy light, against the rose tone of the sky, the cupolas of the islands and the palaces seem to float, shimmering with the hues of mother-of-pearl, mysterious, dream-like, not like solid stone. The soft lap of the water breaks the silence; the vaporous mists float upwards. Across the light drifts a line of fishing boats, their great brown sails set. A streak of flame-colour strikes on the windows of Venice, a flush of orange and rose. Then in a second the sun is gone, and a brief space of doubt ensues, when day hangs trembling in the balance; then night settles on the lagoon. A hundred bells ring out over the city, clashing and clamouring together in one brazen peal. Soon the peal subsides. The evening breeze springs up mild and sweet from the sea, and the soft and mellow cry of \\\"Stali! Ah Stali!\\\" is heard everywhere. It is the hour when all that is poor and unlovely melts into ethereal beauty. The water is a deep blue-black, save for rippling trails of light from the lamps, which shine like golden stars from the prows of the gondolas. The moon rises, nearly full, and is veiled by hazy clouds; the outlines of the bell towers of the palaces are pale and delicate in the soft light. The stillness of the water streets is soothing, and the prattle of the city falls gently on the ears. No matter how prosaic or how unimpressionable one may be, one soon grows into sympathy with the atmosphere of Venice. It is almost impossible to avoid becoming sentimental as one floats in one's gondola at night, with the twinkling stars above and the twinkling splashes below. One almost unconsciously builds romances round the palaces tottering to decay. Venice is always ready to charm and allure you. It is hard to believe that somewhere there is a working, active, busy life going on. But indeed no one in Venice seems to be in earnest. It is as if the present time does not count, as if it were but an echo of what passed long years ago. People work without aim or energy, and when they suffer it seems as if they were but mumming. A sweetness and a docility steal into one's soul, and one feels that one can do nothing but drift on for ever in this pleasant idleness. Harsh voices become modulated; cross-grained, querulous natures are sweetened; even the flat-faced, spectacled tourists, when they step from the railway station into a gondola and glide into the mystic water city, alive with a myriad glistening lights, develop unconsciously, and despite themselves, into delightful people. On the day when I arrived in Venice, as I was wandering down a lane beyond the Canareggio Canal, I found myself in the Jewish part of the city. It is a fetid and pestilential place. There is about it nothing pleasant, or wholesome, or attractive. The stonework is cracked and rotten. The houses, streaked with dirt, bend over into the water with the weight of years. Most of them are nine stories high, grimy and dirty, and speckled with green spots. There is not a straight line anywhere, and not a whole pane of glass - paper is the substitute. Now and then one sees a patch of plaster on a house; but for the most part the plaster has fallen away, revealing the crumbly red bricks beneath. It gives one a sickening feeling - this terrible poverty, solitude, and neglect. Everything is strange, sullen, mysterious. Men and women with curved noses and eyes set like burning coals in their pale faces glide noiselessly along with furtive glances. The children are half naked, and play about on benches in the streets. I have seen poverty-stricken Jewish quarters before, but never anything so sad as this. The sordidness and terrible despair of it make one's heart ache. There are no green fields and trees to alleviate the misery of the people. Yet, I suppose, the condition of the Jew was worse in the old days. Certainly the injustices and insults which once were prevalent do not occur now. The Christian to-day is on more or less friendly terms with the Jew. They meet one another on the exchange; they talk together, and partake of each other's hospitality. The Christian may despise the Jew; but he has the grace to keep the feeling to himself, for the Jew possesses a great part of the trade of the city, and in money matters has ever the upper hand. He is educated, intellectual, patriotic, and calls himself a Venetian. If he is rich he lives in a fine new house on the Grand Canal and is owner of other houses. An instinct of the poorer class of Jews in Venice is to set up pawnshops and lend money to tradesmen in times of necessity. The Jews are decidedly useful. In the old days they were driven into exile; but they were soon called back. They were made to wear a yellow badge, distinguishing them from Christians. They were not allowed to buy houses or lands, or to exercise any trade or profession excepting that of medicine. They were given a dwelling-place in the dirtiest, unhealthiest part of the city, and called it a Ghetto, meaning a congregation. It was walled in. The gates were kept by Christian guards, who were paid by the Jews, and opened the doors at dawn, closing them at sunset. The Jews were not allowed to emerge on holidays or feast days, and two barges full of armed men watched them night and day. A special magistracy had charge of their affairs. Their dead were buried in the sand on the seashore. Thither the baser of the Venetians made it a habit to go on Mondays in September, to dance and make merry on the graves. The Jews were made to pay tribute to Venice every third year. In spite of all hardships and deprivations, they flourished. As the Christians became poor, the Jews waxed rich. They were not again expelled from the city. They were never disturbed in their Ghetto by actual ill-treatment and violence, excepting on one occasion, when a charge was brought against them of child murder. So the Jews lived peacefully in their own quarter until, with the advent of modern civilisation, their prison walls crumbled away, and some of them went forth from the Ghetto and fixed their habitations in different parts of the city. Many Jewish families, however, cling to the spot made sacred for them by so much suffering and humiliation. Even to this day, although the Jews are distributed everywhere throughout the length and breadth of Venice, never a Christian comes to dwell in the Ghetto. Very many Jews still live there. Some of the women are handsome, with Oriental grace, delicate, sensitive, highly bred. The only time when the Ghetto has at all a picturesque appearance is the autumn. Then the air is filled with white floating particles, feathers of geese, which seem to be plucked by the whole force of the populace. You see on every doorstep groups of Hebrew youths plucking geese, and on looking into the interior you will observe strings of the birds suspended from the rafters, while an odour of roast goose greets your nostrils wherever you may go. \\n\\nHISTORY\\n\\nWith her pomp and pageantry, her wealth of art, her learned academies, her schools of painting, and her sumptuous style, Venice at the prime of her life was great, dazzling, splendid. Her navy was supreme. Her nobles were the richest in Europe. This opulence and this pride led to her downfall. She was unable to resist the temptation of building herself an empire on the mainland, thereby causing jealousy among the other Italian States. Rome became fearful of her own safety, and, with the intention of crushing the Republic, formed the League of Cambray. Rome did not achieve her object; but Venice was weakened by the blow, and misfortune after misfortune fell upon her. The passage round the Cape of Good Hope was discovered; which took commercial trade with the East out of her hands, and left her no longer the mart of Europe. Then came the great battles with the Turk, in which both blood and money of Venice flowed in vain. Europe was either powerless or too indifferent to help. Gradually the strength of Venice was broken. She declined and sank. Still, the rigidity and the power of endurance of the Venetian constitution were marvellous. She kept a semblance of life long after the heart had ceased to beat. The constitution of the State was the most elaborate imaginable, and not easily brought to nothing. Nevertheless, although there were occasional flashes of the old brilliancy of Venice, her day was over. The last of her Doges yielded the State to Napoleon without a blow. Laying the ducal biretta on the table, he called to his servants, \\\"Take it away: I shall not use it more.\\\" When the first refugees came from the mainland and started life on the islands of the Archipelago, the mud-banks of Torcello and Rivoalto, they little thought that they were founding a city which was to be the admiration of the whole world, that her navy would ride supreme in all known waters, that Venice was to be the pride of the Adriatic. When those early people, the Veneti, from whom the Venetians take their name, drove in their first stakes and built their wattled walls, they could not have foretold that this was to be the greatest of medi\\u00e6val republics, the centre of the commerce of Europe. Nature helped Venice handsomely. Had the channels been deeper, men-of-war might have entered and conquered the city. Had the waves been stronger, the airy structure that we know as Venice would have been supplanted by the ordinary commercial seaport. Had there been no tide, for sanitary reasons the city would have been uninhabitable. Had the tide risen any higher than it rose, there would have been no water entrances to the palaces, the by-canals would have been filled up, and the character of the place spoiled. One's imagination is inclined to run riot in Venice. One gilds, and romances, and fills the city with pomp and pageantry, ornamenting the canals with State barges, the piazza with noble men and fair women, and the Ducal Palace with illustrious Doges. But far more interesting is it to see Venice as she really is, in her own simple strength. Think of the more rugged Venice, that city built by strong and patient men against such terrible odds, and in so wild and solitary a spot. In order to gain some idea of Venice as she was in those early days, it is well to go out in a gondola at low tide, when the canal is a plain of seaweed. As your gondola makes its way down a narrow channel, you have some conception of the difficulties with which the founders of Venice had to contend. To the narrow strips of land, long ridges guarding the lagoon from the sea, ill sheltered from the waves, the few hundred stragglers came. Their capital, Padua, had been destroyed by the northern hordes, and they took shelter in the islands of the lagoon. So desolate and wind-swept were these islands that one can scarcely imagine men disputing possession of them with the flocks of sea-birds. They were impelled by no whim, however: they were exiles driven by necessity. Here they looked for a temporary home, lived much as the sea-birds lived, and were quite fearless. The soil, composed chiefly of dust, ashes, and bitumen, with here and there a layer of salt, was rich and fertile. This was in the fifth century of our era, of which period there are but few Venetian records. Still, one thing is certain: the Veneti were not a primitive or barbarous people. Fugitives as they were, they were for the most part of high birth and associations. They had character and intelligence. In their mud huts they possessed a social distinction and a political training such as would have graced the most sumptuous of palaces. In quite early days they began to put their heads together and to form a definite system of polity. Year by year the little community was added to. Battle and bloodshed continued on the mainland, and men and women flocked to the islands. It is curious to notice how rank and social distinction assert themselves. Blood will out. Wherever human beings are gathered together, whether on the islands of the Adriatic or on those of the South Seas, and however sorry their plight or great their general misfortune, different grades will become visible. Men and women will place themselves one above the other, the master and the man, the mistress and the maid - such is the law of humanity all the world over. Calamity did not in the long run have much effect upon the higher class of refugees, and the position of the lower classes was not bettered. Sympathy had levelled social distinctions for a time; but that was not for long. Soon, in the natural course of events, when the little colony grew into a city, and the origin of the Veneti had faded almost into a tradition, the various ranks became distinct. True, they lived as sea-birds live, one kind of food common to both, and one kind of house sheltering both; but the poor man and the rich did not live in equality. As the community grew in importance they began to cultivate their islands and to build unto themselves ships. By force of necessity, they became expert in all matters of navigation, as agile on the water as on land, fearless. They acquired a better means of navigation and a wider knowledge of the lagoons than any other State possessed. Then they began to be attacked. With great courage and determination, Venice resisted all her foes - Gothic, Lombard, Byzantine, and Frank. Her position was peculiar, vague. She acknowledged a certain allegiance to the Court of Byzantium; yet by her acts she recognised the supremacy of the kingdoms on the mainland. Neither Byzantium nor Ravenna, and not Padua, could claim the lagoons. Venice was marvellously diplomatic. She drew from East and West exactly what she wanted to make her a nation by herself. While she pretended allegiance to several empires, she was in reality struggling for independence. In the stillness of the lagoon and the freedom of the sea air, the germs of individuality grew and flourished. They had a congenial soil and fitting nutriment. It is wonderfully interesting to watch the progress of the little State - the diplomatic way she went to work: how when she was weak and unable to stand alone she feigned allegiance to a stronger Power, yet never bound herself by written word; how she played one Power against the other; and how in the end, when sufficiently strong, under the shelter of her various foster-mothers, she struck out for freedom boldly. There is a letter from Cassiodorus, Prefect of Theodoric the Great, which throws light upon the relations of Venice with the Goths. Theodoric endeavoured to veil his power over Venice under the guise of alliance or of hospitality. At the time of the famine in 520 he came to their rescue with provisions. This gave him a certain hold over the Venetian people. It imposed upon them a debt which was not to be easily discharged. A letter written by Cassiodorus in 523 is neither more nor less than a demand to the Venetians to bring supplies of oil, wine, and honey, which the islands possessed, to the Goths. The letter, which is of florid style, is one long sneer veiled in delicate flattery. Cassiodorus explains that the Venetians own certain ships, that they are well built, that the sea is an easy path to them; and he begs that the vessels will transport the tributes of Istria to the shores of his country. By this letter one realises that the Venetians had already a reputation as pilots and mariners, and knew well how to thread in and out the channels of the lagoons. Theodoric was a generous and powerful neighbour, and the only homage the Venetians could give the Goths in return was their water service; but they felt their weakness and dependence deeply, and were continually waiting for an opportunity to better their position. Consequently, when the war broke out, after Theodoric's death, between his successors and the Greek Emperor, the Venetians struggled to make themselves of value, and took an active share in the operations. They sided with the Lombards, and conveyed a large reinforcement of Lombard mercenaries to their destination. That was the beginning of their intimate connection with Constantinople. Two churches were erected in commemoration of the services of the islanders. These were built of costly materials, probably obtained from buildings on the mainland which were partially destroyed by the invaders. The Venetians were enabled to transport these treasures in their ships. Much to the anger of the Paduans, Venice was growing very rapidly, and was gradually, by sheer competence, absorbing all the coast and river trade. Longinus paid a visit to Venice, begging that she would procure means of transport for his people. This was granted; but he endeavoured to force the Venetians to accept the suzerainty of his master, which was immediately refused in a grand and sovereign manner. The Venetians declared that, amid much toil and labour, and in the face of many hardships from Hun, Vandal, Goth, and Lombard, God had helped and protected them in order that they might continue to live in the watery marshes. They proudly stated that this group of islands was an ideal habitation, and that no power of emperor or prince should take it from them. It was impossible to attack them, they maintained, unless by the sea; and of that they were assured masters. This reception must have impressed Longinus. In place of a weak little State requiring the protection of his country, he found the Venetians a fierce and self-reliant people. He could obtain only a very vague promise from the diplomatic Venetians. They would acknowledge the Emperor as overlord, they said, but only on their word of honour: they would take no oath of fealty. Still, the rule of the Lombard over Venice was of longer duration than that of any other State. A great trouble beset Venice at about this period. When the first settlers began work on the islands, each little group had a separate life, its people retaining as far as possible the customs, the religion, and the constitution of their ruined homes on the mainland. The largest townships which sprang up on the Lido were Heraclea, Jesolo, and Malamocco. These gradually grew together into a federation of twelve communes, each governed by its own tribune; and the tribunes had regularly a general assembly for the settlement of such business as affected the common interests of the lagoon. Jealousy and civil feuds, however, sprang up among the islanders, as one after another endeavoured to acquire supremacy. Heraclea tried to take the lead, and to destroy Jesolo; but she in her turn was attacked, and razed to the ground, by Malamocco. The civil trouble well-nigh caused the destruction of Venice. The tribunes intrigued; family rose against family, clan against clan; and there was terrible bloodshed. For nearly two years and a half the Republic was in anarchy. The constitutional evil sapped the general prosperity, obstructed trade and industries, and brought property to havoc. Had it continued much longer, the people would have frittered their strength away in private quarrels, and the State of Venice might never have emerged; but pressure from the mainland was brought to bear on Venice, and it became necessary for the various committees to consolidate as one body and sweep away the perils that were confronting them. The Lombards were becoming bolder and bolder. The Monarchy grew and grew, and at last the Republic of Venice feared that it might desire to add the islands of the Adriatic to its dominions. \\n\\nSALUTE\\n\\nThis awoke Venice from lethargy. It was the peril of the sea that formed and completed her. The pressure was very severe. East and West were beginning to ask her very plainly to choose on which side and under whose protection she intended to place herself, and they did not intend to wait long for an answer. Venice, subtle and diplomatic, put off the evil hour as long as she possibly could; but her policy became obvious soon. She could no longer feign fealty first to one Empire and then to another, and meanwhile struggle for independence. The time had come for action. The critical moment was at hand. Either she must put herself under protection of the East or of the West, or declare her independence. Any course was dangerous, perhaps fatal. Out of the three possible issues, Venice chose the most perilous, severing herself from both East and West. The result was fortunate. Thrown upon her own resources, she saved herself by energy. King Pippin invited Venice to join in a war. Venice refused, and prepared to defend herself, trusting in the courage of her men and the intricacy of the lagoon. From north and south King Pippin could concentrate his forces upon Venice, and victory seemed easy; but he had forgotten the natural defences of the sea-bound city. He did not know the shoals and deeps of the sea home. A life's study would scarcely have taught him. A certain noble assumed the lead of the Venetian people. He commanded them to remove their wives, children, and goods to a little island in mid lagoon - Rialto, impregnable from land or sea. This done, the fighting men took up positions on the outlying islands, and awaited the attack of the Franks. Pippin seized on Brondolo, Chioggia, and Palestrina, and tried to press his squadron on to the capital; but the shoals stopped him. His ships ran aground; his pilots missed the channels; and the Venetians pelted them with darts and stones. For six months Pippin struggled; but the Venetians kept him at bay by their network of canals and their oozy mud-banks. They shook off every assault. In the summer there came a rumour that an Eastern fleet was approaching. Pippin tried one more appeal to the Venetians, begging them to own themselves his subjects. \\\"For are you not within the borders of my kingdom?\\\" he said. \\\"We are resolved to be the subjects of the Roman Emperor,\\\" they answered, \\\"and not of you.\\\" The King was forced to retire. This great victory seemed to have the effect of consolidating the Venetians effectively. They agreed thenceforward to work together for the common cause. War had completed the union of Venice. She had emerged from her trial an independent State. There was no more internal discord. Venetian men and Venetian lagoons had made and saved the State. The spirit of the waters, free, vigorous, and pungent, had passed during the strife into the being of the people. This triumph was really the birth hour of Venice, and the people look back upon it with joy. The victory over King Pippin is cherished to this day as one of the finest events in history. The Venetians realised the peril of the sea from this attack. Also they realised the peril of the mainland from the Hunnish invasion. They then effected a compromise, and chose as the future home of their State a group of islands mid-way between the sea and the land, then known as Rialto, but thenceforth to bear the proud name of Venice. Venice in this union of her people declared her nature, so infinitely various, rich, pliant, and free, that to this day she awakens and in some measure satisfies a passion such as we feel for some person deeply beloved. Her people then struggled to attain from infancy to manhood. For the first time they had learned their own power, and union gave them strength. They began to create their Constitution, that singular monument of rigidity and durability which endured, with hardly a break in its structure, for ten centuries. They built with vigour and enthusiasm that incomparably lovely city of the sea. The aristocracy of Venice emerged. Her empire extended, following the lines of her commerce, in the East. St. Mark was substituted for St. Theodore as patron saint. The crusades were used as a means to conquer Dalmatia, and to plant the lion in the Greek Archipelago. Venice clashed with Genoa, and emerged victorious. Wealth flowed into her State coffers and her private banks. The island of Rialto proved the advantage of its situation, and established a claim for gratitude as the asylum of Venice in her hour of need. The Venetians had seen that the mainland was unsafe, and the attack of Pippin showed that there was danger on the sea. Thus, experience leading to the choice of the middle point, in 810 the seat of the Government was removed to Rialto under Angelo Badoer as Doge. Rialto became a sacrament of reconciliation between Heraclea and Malamocco. It was the glory of Venice that of all parts of Italy she alone remained unscathed by the foreign ravages of the fifth century and the conquest of the eighth. Venice alone was left out of all Italy's ruin. She alone escaped pure and undefiled. This marvellous period of her history - the repulses of the Franks and the creation of her State - requires no embellishments; yet the Venetians loved to gather a mythology of persons and events. Cannon-balls of bread, they say, were fired into the Frankish camp in mockery of Pippin's hope of strong Rialto surrendering. Then, again, there are the stories of the old woman who lured the invader to his final effort when half his forces were lost; of the canal Orfano, which ran with foreign blood, and won its name from the countless Frankish hordes that day made desolate; of the sword of Charles, which was flung into the sea when the Emperor acknowledged his repulse and cried, \\\"As this my brand sinks out of sight, nor ever shall rise again, so let all thoughts of conquering Venice fade from out men's hearts, or they will feel, as I have felt, the heavy displeasure of God.\\\" All these stories were absolutely untrue; but they were born of a pardonable pride. The Venetians held their country in a singularly powerful devotion. Possibly this was because they were so closely shut in on these few little islands, precious morsels of land snatched from the devouring sea. Certain it is that they toiled for the State as no other nation has toiled before or since. They were determined that Venice should be great, that she should be beautiful; and century after century of Venetians devoted their lives to this work, sinking their own interests in hers. The Republic was before everything. Wherever one goes in Florence, one finds traces of great and famous men of all periods and of all crafts - painters, poets, writers, statesmen, - in every square, in every street, you are reminded of them; their spirits and their works live with you wherever you may go. But in Venice, where are they? There is the city - yes: there is that; and there are the archives, the annals of the city, histories without number, marvellous histories; - but the familiar figures, the great men that we honour and look for, - they are not here. Venice herself was the centre of all their aspirations, all their affections. She was erected as would be a treasure-heap: all the choicest and all the best were there. One knows but little, for example, of the great painters - the men, with beautiful thoughts, who filled the churches and the palaces with untold splendour, glowing sunshine. Their works are left, and their names; but no more. It seems as if they must have kept one another down, that Venice alone might shine. If one wishes to study the history of Venice, there is no difficulty. Historic documents without number are accessible. Every period, every vogue, every year, is carefully studied and commented upon by keen observers, men of the greatest talents. These records glow with life and energy. In quite early days, when the Republic was in its infancy, - when there was no aristocracy, no great and powerful State, - even the fishermen and the merchants and the salt manufacturers had a longing to chronicle the doings of the community. The palaces which were being built, and the churches, - all these they wished to have chronicled for ever. Numberless historians there were, and all nameless - men of extraordinary skill and genius. Embellishments and fables abound; but on the whole these histories, written with great realism, bring back a vivid picture of the State. No Venetian ever tires, ever did tire, of the history of his country. It is the one subject that is of endless interest to him. The trade of Venice, her ceremonies, her treaties, her money, the speeches of her orators - all are chronicled. Venice was looked upon by Italy very much as we look upon America. She had no long and glorious history - at least, no history of anything beyond handicraft - no literature, no ancient manuscripts. The Florentines, on the other hand, had a great enthusiasm for ancient history. They were proud of their descent, and gloried in looking back to a long Etruscan civilisation. When one visits Florence, there is no difficulty in gathering knowledge concerning her great men of any period. Their shadows walk in her streets; their memories will never fade. You meet them everywhere - the painters, the monks, the gallants, the statesmen, - the individualities of the men who were the makers of Florence. The Venetians had no sympathy with the Florentines. They could not understand the Florentine desire to live with the past rather than the present. There are very few names which stand out prominently in the history of Venice, names concerning which a great deal is known; but there are one or two stories that are picturesque and popular, stories which are ever fresh to the Venetians. One is of a prince, the beheaded Doge Marino Faliero, - not at all an important incident in Venetian history, but one that is very dear to the hearts of the people, because of its melancholy. The prince was a man of hasty temper and haughty nature, and could brook no slight to his dignity. Once a bishop kept him waiting, and that worthy, for his misdemeanour, received, to the astonishment of everyone, a sound box on the ear. Before he came to the throne, Faliero was of great service to the State. He was offered the throne of Venice at the age of seventy-six, and married a young and beautiful woman. The story runs that a young gallant called Michele Steno, having been turned out of her presence, insulted the lady and her husband by pinning an impudent message to the chair of the Doge. The young man was brought before the \\\"Forty,\\\" excused on the plea of his age and impetuosity, condemned to prison for two months, and banished from Venice for a year afterwards. This slight punishment for so grave an offence stung Faliero to the quick. He felt that, though he occupied the Venetian throne, he had scarcely more power than the beggar at his gate. All his life he had been an active, energetic man, a ruler of men; his word had been law, and his counsels listened to with respect and acted upon. Now he was powerless. He was insulted by the young nobles, and had no power to punish them; his authority was entirely disregarded. This state of things grew worse and worse. Two of his old friends also were insulted by noblemen. At last Faliero's temper could endure no longer. In the April of 1355 he formed a conspiracy, and tried to assert his supremacy. Six months after his triumphant arrival in Venice as Doge, an old man and friendless, enraged at the insults offered to him, he struck one mad and foolish blow for freedom. The plot was betrayed on the eve of the catastrophe. The conspirators were strung up in one long ghastly line on the piazza. Faliero himself was beheaded at the foot of the stairs where a few short months before he had sworn the promissione on assuming the office of Doge. \\n\\nA GLIMPSE INTO BOHEMIA\\n\\nOn one occasion we arrived at Venice early in the morning. I was frightened at the darkness and the stillness, and the tall black houses looming high above us: it seemed that brigands must be lurking there, ready to murder us. Absolute silence reigned, except for mysterious sounds as if melodious voices were calling a refractory dog - \\\"Puppy,\\\" \\\"Puppy,\\\" \\\"Puppy,\\\" we heard on every side. It was the warning of the gondoliers as they passed one another in the darkness. I longed for some accustomed natural noise. If only something would fall and make a splash! The silence set one's nerves on edge. We hired a gondola, and glided swiftly and silently out into the darkness, our gondolier's ringing voice joining the chorus of \\\"Puppy.\\\" And so dexterously did he handle his dainty craft that, even as we turned corners and passed other gondolas in the pitch-black darkness, not a sound was made, not a splash. I felt like beating the water with the palms of my hands to make a disturbance. This silent gliding went on for about twenty minutes, until suddenly we drew up by an enormous silver-grey palace down a side canal, one of the largest palaces in Venice, with broad marble steps and badly-made deal doors. After some time the doors were opened, and an old lady appeared, bowing and talking in rapid Italian. She led us up the steps and through a colossal hall of marble, all marble, with staircases on either side leading on to spacious landings, into a suite of rooms that seemed more like the state apartments of a king than those of an ordinary hotel. One of the first things I did when I awoke in the morning was to get out on to the roof of the palace and look about me. I always ask to be directed on to the roof when I arrive at a new place. And there I remained the whole morning, painting, deaf to the pleadings of my friends that I should come down and eat. It was the chimneys that fascinated me! From the decorative standpoint they were quite startling. Chimneys, chimneys, everywhere, and such chimneys - grouped into pictures in every direction! There were clusters of twos, and clusters of threes; and wherever there were spaces that could be used for decoration they were used to the full. Each one of these chimneys seemed to have its own particular character. Some bulged out at the top in graceful lines; some were square and stolid; others were light and airy. At the base of some bloomed a blaze of flowers from the roof gardens. Each one was different. When I learned that a book had been published on the chimneys of Venice I was not in the least surprised. When my friends were able to tear me away from chimneys we got into our gondola and allowed the gondolier to take us where he pleased, to drift about in the by-canals. I wanted my impressions of Venice to be quite haphazard. We glided in the gondola past marble palaces - green palaces, pink palaces, blue palaces, all toned and variegated with age. Venice struck me as being a highly-coloured city, the most brilliantly coloured I had ever seen. It was not, as most cities are, merely a background for brightly-dressed figures: the buildings themselves were coloured, and the gondolas and the figures were black and sombre. Every wall, every doorway, was coloured. We glided past a series of crazy old doorways of blues, greens, and vermilions. Each door was broken with many changes of colour, and the red, rusty ironwork above, just where it caught the sun, was of a rich golden sienna. Certainly Venice is the most highly-coloured city in the world. How different from the impressions one finds in Bond Street - the vicious water-colours in which the artist always insists on orange and vermilion sails and crisp, flowing reflections that have been painted on slanting tables: the water-colours that are so sought after and so saleable! That Venice is vividly coloured I admit; but there is a scumble over the city. Age has toned it. The pink palace reflected in the green water is totally unlike the pink palace of the blobby water-colours. There are blues, and violets, and old-rose tones, and a certain bloom in it that these artists never seem to give. And to a certain extent these pictures handicap one: one feels annoyed to think that Venice should be so caricatured. You see the Bridge of Sighs at daybreak; you see the Salute by moonlight; and somehow you cannot forget these eternal water-colours. There is a certain resemblance, sufficient to irritate. Indolence was upon us. Already we were becoming apathetic. There was something about the atmosphere that encouraged a delightful languor. The residents said it was the sirocco. The sirocco seemed answerable for many deficiencies: it was always being blamed. Later, when we came in touch with the artists, we found that it was the normal excuse for not working. We discovered groups of them sitting about in the square drinking, and when we asked them if they had done any work they all said, \\\"No: there is a sirocco on now: of course, we can't work.\\\" Venice is overrun with artists; yet how few you see at work! Here and there you will find a stray one in a gondola painting, but very rarely. We were drifting about idly. Our gondolier was quite a part of the picture - young, very handsome, with a musical voice. And I began in a dreamy way to muse as I watched him. My thoughts went back for the moment to the Thames - to an old gentleman toiling in a punt. He was once a handsome young gondolier like this one, gracefully piloting a gondola through the canals of Venice; but now he had grown old on the Thames. There is no doubt that the gondola is made for Venice: it is futile to try it elsewhere. And then the colour is right. The gondola ought to be black. It became so naturally and as a matter of economy. People used to spend too much money on their gondolas, and colours had to be forbidden. I was in a dreamy mood, and I began to wonder what became of the handsome young gondoliers - they were all handsome and all young. They could not remain so for ever. What became of the old ones? I soon learnt. When gondoliers grew to be too old for their tasks they drifted on to the landing-stages. There we saw them, with marvellous crooks, catching the gondolas and drawing them into the proper places. I examined these sticks, and was surprised to find that some of them were of very great value. The gondolier prizes and decorates his stick just as a bootblack tends his stand: only, where the bootblack has coppers and bits of tinsel, the Venetian has pure gold coins dating back to the time of the Doges. This love of collecting and cherishing beautiful things is characteristic of the peasant people of Venice. Women will spend their savings in inches of gold chain, which they join together into long strings, and sometimes a woman will have festoons of gold chain collected for two or three generations. It is their way of investing money. We drifted along all the afternoon through the canals, being hooked on to different landing-stages by these old gentlemen; and we came to the conclusion that this was really the end of our handsome gondolier. We were anxious to meet the artists of Venice, and had been told of a certain restaurant, the Panada, where they generally congregated. In the evening, then, we landed, and went thither to dine. The artists who went to the Panada, we had been told, were those who had \\\"let themselves go\\\" more or less - who had been taken hold of by the sirocco and had settled down to loafing. When they first arrived in Venice they went to wine-shops, little dark places, and dined off macaroni and harsh drink. The Panada was more or less organised for the convenience of artists. In the first place, you were not bored by having to tip waiters - a duty that is always trying to an artist who is in between two exhibitions. And nearly all the Panada artists were in that condition. They had nearly all had exhibitions in Bond Street which had been \\\"great artistic successes\\\" - in other words, they hadn't sold any pictures. Another point about the Panada that appealed to the artist was that his bills could run on indefinitely. The bills did run: in fact, the only things that seemed to be at all active in Venice, in spite of the sirocco, were the bills. The Panada was a paradise! Who could resist it? The cooking was excellent, as cooking must always be where painters are, for they are very particular people. The Panada was perfect; the Panada had a sanded floor; the Panada was the noisiest restaurant in Italy. It was our first experience of Bohemia, the painter's world, in Venice; and we sat there, over our untouched dinner, fascinated - fascinated by the general noise and confusion, fascinated even by the unsavoury smells. It was not clean; there was a great deal of smoke, and so much talk! The guests seemed to be screaming and talking at once in all the languages of the world. Two words I heard continually - \\\"breadth\\\" and \\\"simplicity.\\\" Here and there was a little talk of \\\"mediums\\\" and \\\"technique,\\\" but not much. It was generally broad principles that were discussed. There was no mistaking these groups of men. They were artists to their finger-tips in everything save work. They dressed like artists, talked like artists, and behaved like the artists one reads about in novels: the Ouida artists. They wore neckties reaching down to their waists, collars two sizes too large and cut very low; their hands were always a little soiled, and their finger-nails never quite clean. The waiters also were soiled. They were very toney indeed, and very apathetic - toes turned inwards, heads bent slightly forward. They were dejected from want of variety: there was no uncertainty in the Panada as to tips. They came in on the aggregate and received lump sums; but there was a general depression about the people that waited. All were soiled at the Panada - the waiters, the artists, and the linen. But we very soon began to talk of this dirt as tone, and then it didn't seem to matter so much. Everything seemed to be worked on more or less artistic principles. There were quaint decorative dishes. The puddings were pink; the butter was stained; and altogether it required great habits to enjoy food at the Panada. By perseverance, I was told, it was possible to acquire an appetite. There were tables of different sizes, and groups of artists belonging to different sects - some antagonistic, some sympathetic: Dottists, and Spottists, and Stripists. Sometimes when the Dottists and Spottists happened to be friends for the minute they would join their tables together and make one long one. But this was only now and then. Usually the groups in the Panada were formed of twos. Often genius sat alone. Now and then, when a big picture was sold, the restaurant was very festive: the artist had a dinner-party, to which everyone had been invited. But generally it was a small water-colour that was sold, and the party went off to a small caf\\u00e9 down by a side canal. There was one man who got himself up to look like King Charles, and he was King Charles to the life! Long hair rested on his shoulders, and an enormous tie adorned his neck; his trousers and waistcoat were fringed, and his boots and beard were pointed. He had a coat of velvet that through age had become marked with an opalescent mottle. If he stood in front of an age-toned palace you never knew which was coat and which was palace. He possessed no earthly goods, but paid his way all over the world by painting portraits. He would either cut you out in black paper for fivepence or draw an elaborate portrait in pastel for one franc fifty. This celebrated man came up to us, and began to paint our portraits. Before we knew where we were he had cut out, dry-pointed, and stippled us; and melted away, leaving behind him a whole tableful of works of art, side by side with his bill. Then another man introduced himself to us, and explained that this was quite the usual thing for \\\"King Charles\\\" to do. He pointed out how romantic and interesting it all was: he seemed quite convinced that the place was full of romance. For us Bohemia had lost its romance. We felt that we had been green, grass-green, and that (to use a vulgarism) the gilt was off the gingerbread. The room was becoming stuffy; the Bohemians were noisy and dishonest; and the waiters, no longer toney, were dirty. So we paid our own bill and \\\"King Charles's,\\\" and left the Panada and romance for the open air. In the piazza the band was playing the popular music that one knows so well from the barrel organs. Instinctively one thought of London, Soho, and performing monkeys. But this impression was swept away when I saw the picture that presented itself before me in St. Mark's. What an extraordinary change had come over the piazza since dinner! A swarm of locusts might have settled upon Venice - a dark, seething mass, clustering round the walls of St. Mark's and filling up every inch of space. They were pilgrims from Russia, thousands of them - men, women, and children - on their way to Rome - poor peasants who had saved up for this pilgrimage during their whole lifetime, sleeping the sleep of the righteous, their bodies pressed close against the holy walls of St. Mark's as though for sympathy. It was a dark-coloured crowd, all dressed in black, with big capes and long boots and little astrachan caps, - a strong silhouette of black against the brilliant background of St. Mark's. It was a marvellous picture, and pathetic. These peasants seemed to be waiting for a greater, deeper joy, when they would be transformed to new creatures and fly back to their native land on the wings of a beautiful faith. The moon herself shone down upon them caressingly, lighting up many a weary, travel-worn face, turning their sombre hues to silvers, and greens, and violets. St. Mark's, with this dark mass of people at her base, seemed almost flippant by contrast. This was a night of contrasts! The dirt and filth of the little restaurant, with its noisy Bohemians: and then the quiet night, a clear, bright, silvery blue night such as one only sees in Venice; the weary pilgrims and the sumptuous cathedral; the dainty lightness and gracefulness of St. Mark's and the broad, simple, strong tower rearing her head into the sky - the Campanile, now, alas! no more than a memory. It was a picture such as you see but once in a lifetime. This building of precious stones, one of the most beautiful in the world, so rich with gold and mosaic, jewels, marbles, and lapis lazuli, that even in the cold blue light of the moon and a few dim gas-lamps it seemed to be dancing and sparkling with colour, - this, and the sleeping peasants in their rags - what a contrast! Then, again, what a contrast suddenly to turn from these dark groups to the jewellers' shops and the huge windows full of glittering Venetian glass! To see the gaily-dressed crowds sipping their coffee outside Florian's famous caf\\u00e9 that had never been closed during three hundred years! Here was nothing but brightness and gaiety. An excellent band played in the middle of the piazza. Smartly-dressed young men and military officers in pale blue uniform strolled about the square, quite conscious that they were being regarded favourably by girls and their mothers sitting at the coffee-tables. Florian's was an ideal place for the artist. It was never shut. It was quite the fashionable thing to drink coffee there after dinner, and one had the chance of talking to one's friends and acquaintances. Fascinating fruits were brought round to us - grapes, and figs, and almonds dipped in caramel sugar and stuck on to sticks. The men smoked cigars as long as those smoked in Burma. So capacious were they that they put them on little stoves in the way a woman heats her curling-tongs, and by the time they had drunk their coffee the cigars were probably alight. When the band had stopped playing we went to Bauer's to drink beer. And so ended a typical day in the life of an artist in that most fascinating city on the waters. Thanks to the kindness of Mr. Bozzi, the manager of the well-known Danieli's Hotel, who often piloted me about the intricate network of streets, I became familiar with many of the unfrequented quarters, which, as a rule, remain absolutely unknown to the tourist. \\nARCHITECTURE\\n\\nIn architecture one finds a history of Venice. It is the most definite expression, the most faithful embodiment, of the local genius. It presents realistically the daily life and thought and work of a bygone race. The intense love of the early Venetians for colour shows itself in the gleaming gold, the veined marble, and the white sculpture. Another of their affections is symbolised by the frequent introduction of children in the sculptured works. There are children of all periods, of all appearances, illustrating various of the changes in thought and in ideals that were continually coming to pass. Those of the earlier time are sturdy, strapping youngsters, with a purposeful look about them; whereas the children of the fifteenth century are fat, chubby, and uninteresting. In the early stage of her history Venice was a Greek rather than an Italian city, and her buildings were of Byzantine type. That is easily explained. During her first great period Venice was connected by sea with Constantinople and the East, but cut off by the lagoons and marshes from Lombardy and the rest of Italy. Only a few of the Byzantine buildings remain. The period is principally marked by the precious stones and coloured marbles encrusted in the brickwork, and by the ancient reliefs inserted in the blank walls of churches and houses. Among Byzantine buildings St. Mark's comes first. The existing building began to be constructed at the close of the tenth century; and Byzantine architects worked at it for nearly a hundred years. It was largely remodelled afterwards, and was altered in decoration during the different reactions of architecture; but the bulk of it belongs to the early period, and is in the pure Byzantine style. Parts of it remind one greatly of St. Sophia in Constantinople, on the lines of which, I believe, St. Mark's was partially modelled. There were many Gothic additions in the shape of pinnacles and pointed gables above the chief arches, just sufficient intrusion of the Gothic element to add a touch of bizarre extravagance; and in the sixteenth century many of the old mosaics were superseded by jejeune Renaissance compositions, of no decorative value, incongruous with the general scheme. Nevertheless, the church as a whole, as I have said, still remains essentially Byzantine. The main fabric of the fa\\u00e7ade represents the original Byzantine Romanesque building, and is in almost every particular similar to the picture of the church given in the thirteenth-century mosaic. The turreted pinnacles and the false gables are Gothic additions of the fifteenth century - merely screens of decoration with no roof behind. The building is truly Oriental. In the shape of a Greek cross with four equal arms, it faces west, and has a high altar and a presbytery at the east end. It was first of all the domestic chapel of the Doge's Palace, and then the shrine of the body of St. Mark the Evangelist. Everywhere one sees the motto, \\\"Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista mea\\\" (\\\"Peace to thee, Mark, my Evangelist\\\"). There are the symbols of all the four evangelists, - Luke, a bull; Mark, a lion; John, an eagle; Matthew, an angel. There are scenes from the life of Christ - the Adoration of the Magi and Annunciation to the shepherds. Venice in the Byzantine period must have been a city of great architectural wealth and splendour, - far in advance of other Italian towns, although, of course, destitute of the engineering glories of France and Germany. One can tell this by the few remaining Byzantine palaces, - very few of them are purely Byzantine. There is the magnificent Palazzo Loredan, one of the most beautiful of all the palaces on the Grand Canal, and a splendid example of the Byzantine Romanesque period. It has about it a distinct tinge of Oriental feeling; the capitals of some of the columns are exquisitely beautiful, and there are not many Gothic alterations. Next to this palace comes the Palazzo Farsetti, Romanesque of the twelfth century, simpler in style and with less ornamentation. It is really more nearly pure Romanesque than Byzantine, and shows no Oriental influence whatever. It is graceful and dignified. The \\\"Fondaco dei Turchi,\\\" a very early Byzantine Romanesque palace, assumed its name in the seventeenth century, when it was let to the Turkish merchants of Venice. Originally a twelfth-century palace, it has recently been so much restored as to have lost all its air of antiquity and the greater part of its earlier interest, although it still represents symbolically the splendid homes of the Byzantine period. It is much like St. Mark's, and is the only surviving example of a building all in one style. The arches, the capitals, the shafts, the parapets and decorative plaques, are modernised, to be sure; but they are typical if not original, and give one a very good idea of what the Grand Canal must have been like before the invasion of the Gothic style and the Renaissance. One gleans a very good idea by means of these palaces of how extremely civilised and peaceful Venice must have been at that early period. In northern Europe the homes of medi\\u00e6val nobles were dark and gloomy castles built mainly for defence, having single heavy oak doors studded with nails, and great iron gates and drawbridges; there were no openings in the ground floors, and the windows above were small and grated. For Venice such fortifications were unnecessary. Her palaces were airy and graceful; for she was protected from the outside by her moat of lagoons, and from the inside by her strong internal Government. These ancient buildings, the \\\"Fondaco dei Turchi\\\" and the rest, were even then gentlemen's palaces, always open and undefended, the homes of pleasure, with free means of access, broad arcades, plenty of light, and presenting a general air of peace and security. It is interesting to notice the later Venetian architecture (as exhibited in the Libreria and the Procuratie Vecchie), developed from this early open and airy style. The native Venetian ideal seems to have traversed all styles, and persisted through them all in spite of endless architectural changes. The Grand Canal was the street of the nobles - the finest street in the world, in the way of architectural beauties. From end to end there are palaces of all periods, from the Byzantine time to the eighteenth century, and all are palaces of the ancient Venetian nobility. The Grand Canal is to Venice what the Strand is to London and the Rue St. Honor\\u00e9 to Paris. It is the most wonderful street in the world. There is nothing so bizarre, so fairy-like, to be seen in any other city through the length and breadth of the globe. It is a marvellous book wherein every family of the Venetian nobility has signed its name. Every wall tells a story; every house is a palace; each was erected by some well-known architect. Pietro Lombardo, Scamozzi, Sansovino, Sammichele (the Veronese), Selva, Vissenti - these were the men who drew the plans and directed the construction of the houses; but unknown architects of the Middle Ages built some of the most picturesque. There were palaces of all styles. After a palace of the Renaissance comes one belonging to the Middle Ages in Gothic Arab style, much like the Ducal Palace, with balconies, lancet windows, and trefoils. Then there will be a palace adorned with great plaques or medallions of differently coloured marbles; anon a great bare sweep of rose-toned wall. All styles are here - Byzantine, Saracen, Lombard, Gothic, Roman, Greek, and Rococo - fanciful capitals, Greek cupolas, mosaic and bas-relief, classic severity combined with the elegant fantasy of the Renaissance. It is a gallery open to the sky, full of the art of seven or eight centuries. Think of the genius and money and talent expended on this one street by brilliant artists and munificent patrons! The Grand Canal was originally one of the navigable channels by whose aid the waters found their way, through the mud-banks, past the mouth of the Lido to the open sea. It is the original deep water which first created Venice. Up this canal the commerce of all countries used to reach the city in the days of her splendour. The Rialto, the most beautiful bridge in Venice, bestrides the canal in a single span. It was built by Antonio da Ponte. There are two rows of shops upon it; and one of the most picturesque scenes in the Grand Canal lies round about it - old houses with platformed roofs, bulging balconies, and stairways with disjointed steps. It is interesting to watch how Byzantine architecture gave place to Gothic when Venice began to conquer on the Italian mainland. Thus Gothic architecture came in, and the conquest of Padua and Verona completed it. The term \\\"Gothic\\\" is very elastic; but there are certain points by which one can tell whether a building is Gothic or not. It is Gothic if the roof rises in a steep gable high above the walls; if the principal windows and doors have pointed arches and gables; if it has a steep roof; if the arches are foliated - that is to say, if the shapes of different leaves are cut into the stone to form a species of delicate tracery like lacework, letting in the daylight. Foliation is especially characteristic of Gothic architecture; some of the windows in Westminster Abbey are foliated. Gothic architecture is very rough and loose and irregular; yet it has a wonderful tenderness and variation of design. Changeableness and variety are the great requirements of perfect architecture. One should be enabled to derive just as much pleasure and instruction from looking at a perfect piece of architecture as from reading one of the finest of classic books. Gothic architecture is essentially truthful and naturalistic. The architects of this period were peculiarly fond of vegetation, which is a sign of gentleness and refinement of mind. Gothic is principally independent. It juts out continually with many pinnacles; there is nothing broad, or uniform, or smooth, about a Gothic building; it is variable, rough, and jutting, though, nevertheless, graceful in the extreme. The materials were rougher then than in the time of the Byzantine architecture, and to atone for this it was necessary to introduce much workmanship. The artists were enthusiastic in their love of Nature, and felt deeply all her changing and complex moods. For example, you may see the difference between a Renaissance and a Gothic palace by imagining the surroundings of the former, its background, gone. It would then be deprived of its charm; whereas if you took a Gothic palace and placed it anywhere, it would still be beautiful. The Ducal Palace expresses the Gothic spirit to perfection. It was the great work of Venice at this period. The best architects, the best labourers, and the best painters were employed in beautifying it. At one time the palace fell into decay, and it was obvious to everyone that it should be rebuilt and enlarged. But the alteration would be extremely expensive. Therefore a law was passed preventing anyone suggesting such alterations unless he had previously paid one thousand ducats to the State. At last a man arose who cared not for the thousand ducats, and suggested the necessary alterations. The palace was then rebuilt. It was palace, prison, senate-house, and office of public business, all in one. There were thirty-six great pillars supporting the lower stories alone, all decorated in the richest possible manner. There was no end to the fantasies of the sculptors at that period - exquisite curves, studied outlines, graceful but complex, solid and strong and beautifully proportioned braided work; lilies and flowers of all kinds intertwined. Much of the sculpture is snow-white, with gold as a background; some of it has glass mosaic let into the hollows. The cross is used a good deal; also the peacock, the vine, the dove. The palace of Semitecolo has some beautiful early-Gothic windows, having false cusps in the arches, so as to make the head a trefoil. One sees here the gradual growth of the arch until it culminates in the Doge's Palace type. There are beautiful balustrades to the balconies, original and belonging to the period. In the early-Gothic palaces one notices a certain softening of the angles - that is to say, in the fine fourteenth-century Gothic buildings. The early Gothic architecture has no cusps to the arches; it shows a transitional form between Venetian Romanesque and Venetian Gothic. There are first-floor arcades early-Gothic, with a somewhat Oriental curve in the arch derived by the early Venetian Gothics from Alexandria or Cairo. The capitals of the columns are characteristic of the period: there are dainty balconies with graceful, slender columns, and cusps to the arches. These Gothic palaces were built by a people who were laborious, brave, practical, and prudent; yet they had great ideas of the refinement of domestic life, and the Gothic palaces remain to-day much the same as when they were newly built - marble balconies, great strong sweeps of delicate-looking tracery, clustered arches. It is the Gothic window that is so perfect, so strong, - built, too, with material that was by no means good. There is so much rivalry, vanity, dishonesty, in the present day, that houses are badly and cheaply built; even in the best of them, bad iron and inferior plaster are used. How many of them, I should like to know, will be standing fifty years hence? Mr. Ruskin is much against our modern windows and the manner in which they are quickly constructed out of bad materials, and the bricks all placed one on top of the other slanting anyhow. The doors of Gothic palaces are all semicircular above. At one time the name of the family was placed over the entrance, and a prayer inserted for their safety and prosperity, - also a blessing for the stranger who should pass the threshold. Inside the houses there is always a large court round which all the various rooms circle, with a beautiful outside staircase supported on pointed arches with coned parapets and projecting landing-places. In the court there is always a well of marble superbly sculptured. The centres of the early Renaissance architecture were Florence, Milan, and Venice. Venice is the only city in which important examples of all three periods of the Renaissance are to be found - the early period, the culminating period, and the period of decay. The Renaissance found better expression in Venice than elsewhere in Italy. In fact, when Florence and Rome had entered upon quite another period, Venice continued it for fully twenty-five years longer. The Venetians were ambitious, exceedingly so; and this ambition was a source of great trouble to the rest of Italy. The balance of power seemed, in their opinion, to be weighing too heavily in the direction of the Queen of the Adriatic; and the peace of the peninsula, they felt, was not by any means assured. The greatest period for Venice was at the end of the fifteenth century, when she had conquered all the land about her from Padua nearly to Milan, and seawards to Dalmatia and Crete. In the market-places of Padua, Vicenza, Verona, and Brescia, the Lion of St. Mark was set up as a sign of the subjugation. Even now one can trace the influence of Venice upon the art of these various places. But the Venetians certainly learnt a great deal from the people whom they conquered. Other influences were brought to bear upon Venetian architecture - as, for example, the Lombardi family, who probably belonged to some part of Lombardy. Venice seems at this time to have gathered unto herself many fine suggestions from the rest of Italy. In fact, Venice absorbed talent from the rest of the world. In quite early days she adopted Byzantine and Arabic architecture; then, in the sixteenth century, she took unto herself the art of the Milanese, who enriched the city with their work. A truly Renaissance building did not appear in Venice until sixty years after the first was erected in Florence, and then, strangely, it had little of the Florentine character. This, after all, is not extraordinary when one comes to think of the bitter war between Florence and Venice in 1467. She took her style of architecture from the countries which she had conquered and naturalised, such as the district of Lombardy; and in her turn she influenced them. The adoption of the Greek forms of Roman architecture which originated in Florence gradually spread and reached Venice; but the Venetians did not struggle, as did the Florentines, to revive and purify Roman architecture. Simply the tendency of the general taste inclined in that direction, and gave to their own Venetian forms of architecture a certain classic air. In the general form of the work of this period one cannot detect the classical influence; but, if you examine into it carefully, you will notice in small details, such as a capital, that some classical subject has been introduced in place of the usual symbolical one. You will also detect in purely Gothic composition signs of the new art influence. For example, in the mouldings there is an introduction of cupids among the foliage, and all the strange fables and gods of the heathen are represented there. This was the period when people were becoming more learned. Later, buildings were erected on purely classical lines; yet they still kept to the Gothic arch. Bartolomeo Buono of Bergamo was one of the greatest architects of his time. In 1520 the work of another architect was noticeable - that of Guglielmo Bergamasco. The question of the church exterior was one of the most difficult problems of the early-Renaissance architect, and he never solved it quite. The churches of Venice nearly all belong to the Renaissance; there were many of them rebuilt under the influence of either Palladian or Jesuit style. Palladio was a great architect; but he had nothing of the Catholic feeling. He was really more suited to build a pagan temple than to build a Christian church. The Jesuit style, moreover, is horrible, with its stumpy columns, bloated cherubs, unhealthy affectations, and fiery ornaments. It is a display without beauty or grace, merely overloaded and heavy. The church of the Scalzi is of extravagant richness. The walls are encrusted with coloured marble; there are frescoed ceilings by Tiepolo and Sansovino; bright tones prevail - more appropriate to a ballroom than to a house of prayer. One can quite imagine a minuet under such a ceiling. Many of the churches in Italy are built in this style, and are compensated only by the number and interest of the valuable objects which they contain. Almost every church has a museum such as would honour the palace of a king. There one sees Titians, Paul Veroneses, Tintorettos, Palmas, Giovanni Bellinis, Bonifazios. The church of the Scalzi has a broad staircase in red brocatelle of Verona, with truncated columns in marble, gigantic prophets, stone balustrades, and doors of mosaic. The Romanesque churches are really beautiful, with their pillars of porphyry, antique capitals, images standing out upon a glitter of gold, Byzantine mosaics, slender columns, and carved trefoils. The church of Santa Maria della Salute has been made famous by the picture of her by Canaletto in the Louvre. One of the most beautiful things within is a ceiling by Titian. Venetian arabesque ornament of the Quattri cento is tenderly sculptured, and the friezes are undercut in a reverent and delicate manner. One of the most beautiful palaces of the Grand Canal is the Palazzo Corner-Spinelli. It is especially noticeable because of the number of windows in the basement, - there is no observable order in the placing of them. Then, again, there are contrasts in the shape of balconies. Some are small and curved inwards; others are long and straight. In 1481 the palaces became of a more advanced character. The central windows were grouped together; but this last feature is characteristic of Venetian architecture of all periods. One of Sammichele's finest works is the Palazzo Grimani, on the Grand Canal. It was carried out by others after Sammichele's death; nevertheless, it is very fine. It has great dignity and majesty, and is a composition such as will be found in Venice alone. Venice is, architecturally, the most interesting city in Italy. It contains works of all periods, from the early Christian foundation to the eighteenth century; and perhaps the best examples of each are there. First there was the school of the Lombardi; next, that of Sammichele and Sansovino, quite distinct, an influence direct from Rome. Then came, closely following, the schools of Palladio and Scamozzi; and a fourth is that of the seventeenth-century artists, who did good work in Venice, but on different lines. The best example of this late period in Venice is Santa Maria della Salute, erected in token of the cessation of the plague. It is situated at the sea gate to the presence-chamber of the Queen of the Adriatic. Few churches of any age can rival it architecturally. The composition is mainly pyramidal. The barocco style is nowhere so appalling as in Venice. It is most untruthful and unprincipled in character. There is a great deal of ostentation and bombastic pomp about it. A terrible example of this can be seen in Doge Valiero's tomb, where the marble is made to imitate silk and cloth wherever possible. The Palazzo Pesaro was built, rich and gross, typical of the domestic Renaissance, when architecture tended to decay. Technically it is a most inferior building. The figures in the sculpture are spasmodic in action, and restless; there is a projecting, diamond-like rustication, far too bold in treatment. The angles are an exaggeration of the style of Sansovino. There are three great causes of the decadence of Venetian architecture. First of all, it was started by purists who were bound too firmly to ancient usages, too much regulated by precedent, coldness, and formality. Secondly, a more disastrous influence was brought to bear - that of Michael Angelo, the example of freedom to the verge of licence. This revolution was brought about partly by the revolt of the public feeling against the restrictions of the purists, partly by real want of knowledge and failure to understand traditional weaknesses and systems of design with regard to construction. The purpose and use of features was misunderstood; uncontrolled freedom was allowed; ornament was added for its own sake, instead of being bound up in architectural lines. By such freaks and caprices almost every building at this time, though not ignoble in composition, was completely disfigured. Thirdly, the architects made the fatal mistake of using the excrescences of a weakness of the great masters and endeavouring to raise them to the dignity of features of design. Thus Venetian architecture withered and decayed, fading out into a pale shadow of what it had once been. That glorious art, which had once been so superb in the hands of the masters, sank into the execution of feigned architecture, false perspective, and fictitious grand fa\\u00e7ades, with bad statues in unreal relief. \\n\\nST. MARK'S\\n\\nWhen you arrive before the Church of St. Mark's you realise that at last, after all your travels throughout the length and breadth of the globe, you have before you a building in which colour and design unite in forming perfection. Here stands without a shadow of doubt the finest building in the world, flawless. It is impossible to imagine that St. Mark's has been built stone by stone, that the brains of mere men have designed it, and that the hands of mere men have set it up. It must, you think, have been there from all time just as it is, - formed as the bubble is formed, and the opal. It is a revelation to look upon such perfect symmetry, such glorious colouring. Like an opal, St. Mark's shows no sign of age. It glitters like a new jewel, and might have been built but yesterday. Unlike most churches, it has no sombre, frowning air. Its spires do not launch themselves into the sky. It does not bristle with towers and arched buttresses. Rather the building seems to stoop and crouch. It is surmounted by domes, as is a Mohammedan mosque, and is a strange mixture of Oriental ornamentation and Christian symbolism. Horses take the place of angels; grace and splendour, the place of austerity and mystery. Who ever heard of gold, alabaster, amber, ivory, enamel, and mosaic being used in the construction of a Christian church? Who ever heard of dolphins, tridents, marine shells, trefoils, cupolas, marble plaques, backgrounds of vividly coloured mosaics and of gold? It is more like a fairy palace, or an Alcazar, or a mosque, than a Catholic church; more like an altar to Neptune than one to the Christian God. The ultimate result of this apparent incoherence is a harmonious whole. Reverence and Christianity are here - an absolute and living faith. Even the most devout Catholic has no cause for complaint. With all its pagan art, St. Mark's preserves the character of primitive Christianity. The exterior is extremely complicated. There are many porticoes, each with columns of marble, jasper, and other precious materials; many mosaics on grounds of gold over each doorway; many historic stories and legends that these mosaics represent; many fantastic forms of angelic beasts, saints, Byzantine and Middle-Ages bas-reliefs, magnificent bronze doors, arcades, lamps, peacocks - so many that it is impossible to attempt to describe them in detail. Even to tell of the delicate structure and the subtle, ever-changing, iridescent colour is beyond me. It is almost bewildering when one thinks that at the time St. Mark's was built every house in every side street had much of the same extravagant richness, beauty of colouring, and superb architecture. As Mr. Ruskin says, it is absurd to imagine that churches were designed in a style particularly different from that of other buildings. There is nothing specially sacred in what we call ecclesiastical architecture. All the houses were built much in the same way. Only, while the houses have fallen into decay, the church has been preserved by a devoted populace. It is not often that one sees a coloured building, a building teeming with colour; but St. Mark's vibrates with colour. There are no blank spaces of grey stone. Every square inch is beautiful. When one enters from the bright sun, St. Mark's appears dim and dark; but you must not judge by that. To appreciate its beauties, the student should visit the church day after day. Gradually they will unfold themselves. That is what constitutes one of the charms of St. Mark's. It is as though one were in a carved-out cave of gold and purple, on a voyage of discovery all by oneself. At first you can see nothing; but as your eyes become accustomed to the darkness, colours begin to grow upon you out of the gloom. Some minutes must elapse before you realise that the floor, which at first you took to be of a deep-toned grey stone, is a mosaic composed of thousands of differently coloured marbles - that you are walking on precious marbles of peacock hues. Golden gleams above your head attract you to the domed ceiling, and, to your delight and amazement, you discover that it is formed entirely of gold mosaic. You are passing a dim recess, and you see a blurred mass of rich colour; after a time you realise that you are looking at a famous masterpiece by one of the great Italian painters. You sit there as in a dream; and one by one the pictures and the mosaics, the Gothic images, the cupolas, the arches, the marbles, the alabaster, the porphyry, and the jasper appear to you - until what was darkness and gloom appears to be teeming and vibrating with colour. St. Mark's carries one away from the everyday world. On the ignorant and the uninitiated it has a marvellous effect. Men and women and children flock to it by the thousands daily. Many and fervent are the worshippers one sees praying before some special saint or beloved Madonna. Some are weeping, and others kneel for hours on the cold stones. The unhappy people of Venice have many sins and sorrows, and there is much that is comforting to them in this rich, majestic church. The fainting spirit is revived and the most desperate person stimulated as he looks about him at the sparkling mosaic roof, the rich walls, and the dimly burning lamps. There is much in precious stones, music, sculptured figures, in pictures of heaven and hell, that appeals to these people. An infinite and pitiful God somewhere about them, these peasants of poor imaginations cannot understand. They want a faith that they can cling to - almost something that they can finger and touch. St. Mark's is to the poor of Venice like a beautifully illustrated Bible. There, in the cupolas, the story of the Old Testament is presented in mosaic, plainly for every eye to see, for the youngest and least educated to understand. It touches them, and appeals to them, and keeps their faith burning bright and clear. There they have the seven days of creation represented, - mysterious, weird, and primitive, - discs of gold and silver representing the sun and the moon. There are the Tree of Knowledge, the Temptation, the Fall, and the Expulsion from Paradise. Then comes the slaying of Abel by Cain, Adam and Eve tilling the ground. There is a strange mosaic of the Ark, with the animals going in two by two on a background of gold; there are the stories of Abraham, of Joseph, and of Moses, all quaintly executed, full of detail and without regard to anatomy. There is no struggle to imitate Nature, and the colouring is good. In the time when St. Mark's was built there were no cheap Bibles, and, if there had been any, the poorer classes could not have read them. Thus the great Church was an endless boon to them, one which could never be quite exhausted. Many and splendid are the lessons these mosaics and pictures taught and continue to teach. The mysteries and beauties of the Bible are impressed upon the mind in a manner that cannot be effaced. All the virtues are there - Temperance quenching fire with water; Charity, mother of the virtues, and the last attained in human life; Patience; Modesty; Chastity; Prudence; Lowliness of Thought, Kindness, and Compassion; and Love which is Stronger than Death. These lessons the Venetians have continually before them, to help them to bear the troubles of this world, and giving them hope for the peace of another. Most of the pictures in mosaic are typically Byzantine, mainly symbolical and of the first school of design in Venice. Upon these pictures the people of Venice live and thrive spiritually: the pleasure is real and pure. Colour has a great influence upon the emotions, just as music has; and colour was used in the earliest times to stimulate devotion and repentance. There are pictures in which the most profound emotion is expressed. When one sees the pictures of Christ's life and passion, one cannot but be touched. By the medium of paintings in the churches, people began to understand and appreciate art, and to feel the need of it in their homes. Not only is St. Mark's an education to the poor and the ignorant: it is also an education to the student and to the artist. Here you have pictures of the nation of fishermen at their greatest period; also you find legends splendidly told, such as the story of the two merchants who brought the bones of St. Mark from Alexandria under cover of pork, crying \\\"Swine! swine!\\\" You see the priests, the Doge, and the people of Venice as they were in the days of her power. In one of the dim corners of St. Mark's is a statue of an old man on crutches with a finger on his lip. This is a Byzantine architect who was sent to Pietro Orseolo from Constantinople, as the cleverest Eastern builder of his time, to construct St. Mark's Church. He was a bow-legged dwarf, and undertook to build this marvellous edifice, unequalled in its beauty, on condition that a statue of himself should be placed in a conspicuous position in the Church. This was arranged. One day the Doge overheard the architect say that he could not execute the work in the way he had intended. \\\"Then,\\\" said Orseolo, \\\"I am absolved from my promise\\\"; and he merely erected a small statue of the architect in a corner of the Church. Think of the makers of St. Mark's - the great men who worked together with brains and hands to make her what she is! The army of artists, painting, designing, sculpturing, one after the other from generation to generation in this great cathedral! Titian, Tintoretto, Palma, Pilotto, Salviati, and Sebastian were among the painters whose designs were used for the mosaics; Bozza, Vincenzo, Bianchini, and Passerini, among the master mosaicists; Pietro Lombardo, Alberghetti, and Massegna, among the sculptors. Then, the other thousands, all men of extraordinary talent, of whom astonishingly little is known, fervent workers! Throughout eight centuries they worked, and with what care and skill and patience! At what a cost, too, these masterpieces must have been achieved! Think of the temples and the quarries that have been robbed of their gold, and of the marbles, the alabaster, and the porphyry. All the saints and prophets and martyrs are there; the stories of the Virgin, of the Passion, and of Calvary; all the scenes from the Old and New Testaments. The early Venetians seem to have revelled in colour and in rich materials. The builders laid on the richest colour and the most brilliant jewels they could find. They were exiles from ancient and beautiful cities, and when they succeeded in war their first thought was to bring home shiploads of precious materials. Just as the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Arabs had an intense love of colour, so had the early Venetians, who used precious stones in great abundance, even in their own private houses. A most extraordinary thing is that there is nothing vulgar about the costliness of St. Mark's. Although both inside and out it is rich beyond words, rich in precious stones, rich in every way, the building is full of reserve. There is no ostentation, no vulgarity. The jewels used in its construction do not for one moment interfere with one's sense of the beautiful, or with reverence and religion. They simply give a rare luxurious feeling to the place, and in the ignorant inspire respect for a Church thus encased and honoured with the richest in the land. Then, again, the jewels do not form a principal part of the ornamentation. One looks first at the exquisite workmanship; and afterwards are noticed the precious materials, which form a subordinate part and do not interfere with the design. It is almost as though a veil had been swept over the whole building, both inside and out, bringing together this wealth of colour and forming it into a complete whole. It has the effect of a marvellous glaze - of a picture that has had a thin glaze swept over it. Wherever you look, the Church teems with colour; but it seems to be piercing through a veil. It is not vivid positive colour, but colour breaking through a skin. In the East I have seen millions of pounds' worth of jewels in one heap, with the sun shining on them, and I was overpowered with this wealth, I was inspired with their costliness; - but St. Mark's does not affect you at all in this way. Rich man and peasant are alike in this respect: they are elevated and stimulated in that building, not because of its costliness, but because of its extreme beauty. The technique is marvellous, but not obvious: the moment you are conscious of technique you may be sure that the work is poor. You never wonder how St. Mark's was built; and that is the highest tribute to the marvellous arts which it expresses. \\n\\nPAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE\\n\\nOne of the chief characteristics of the Venetian school of painters, and one of the most attractive to all art lovers, is their great appreciation of colour. In most of their work colour seems to be the chief motive. Pictures by Venetian painters never suggest drawings. They strike you not as having been coloured afterwards, but as having been painted essentially for the colour. One sees this throughout the whole school. And in their paintings they do not go to extremes. There is no exaggeration in their colouring. They do not err, as do so many schools, either on the foxy-red side or on the cold steely colouring. Unfortunately, much of the beautiful colouring of these pictures is lost by age. One has to become accustomed to that ugly brown skin which has formed upon the surface before one can realise what great colourists these early Venetians really were. The pictures somehow cause one to resent oil as a medium. One realises how different they must have looked when fresh from the easel, and wishes that these great masters could have painted with a medium more lasting - as did the Chinese, whose works are as young and fresh now as if they had been painted yesterday: the years have left no trace whatever: the simple colouring is the same to-day as it was a hundred years ago. Many of the earlier paintings, those of the Gothic Venetians, the less-known men, are a good deal better preserved. Their canvasses have not turned black; the glazings have not departed; and there is no smoky film upon them, as in the case of the works of the great masters, such as Titian, Tintoretto, and Giovanni Bellini, men who came a hundred years afterwards. It may very possibly be that the pigment which painters used then was purer and less adulterated. Certainly one sees in the various schools all over the world that the older the pictures are the better preserved they are. Age never improves a picture - unless, indeed, it is an extremely bad one, when time serves as a thin veil. Undoubtedly these great colourists, the Venetians, influenced the various schools of painters all over the world, and are still influencing them. Originally they worked for the churches, and colour was used exactly as music was used - to appeal to the senses, to the emotions: to influence the people, to teach them biblical stories and parables. It also educated the people to understand painting and to feel the need of it in their daily lives. At about this time the Renaissance began to express itself, not only in poetry and other literature, but also in paintings; and it found clearer utterance in Venice than elsewhere. The conditions at this time were perfect for the development of art. Venice at that period lent herself to art. She was at peace with the whole world, and she was prosperous. The people were joyous, gay, and light-hearted. They longed for everything that made life pleasant. Naturally, they wanted colour. And Venice was not affected by that wave of science which swept over the rest of Italy. The Venetians were not at all absorbed in literature and arch\\u00e6ology. They wanted merely to be joyous. This was an ideal atmosphere for the painter. Such a condition of things could not but create a fine artistic period. The painter is not concerned with science and learning, or should not be. Such a condition of mind would result in feeble, academical work - in struggling to tell a story with his medium, instead of producing a beautiful design. That is partly why the Venetian school has had such a strong influence on art, even until the present day. The conditions were perfect for the development of art, because the patrons were capable of appreciating beautiful form and beautiful colour. Because the public would have it, this new school of painters appeared. The demand was created, and the supply came. There was undoubtedly great friction among the painters of this period, exactly as there has been lately with the modern impressionists and the academic painters. Some of the old Venetians resented the new school that was springing up; but they had eventually to bend and try to paint in sympathy with the senses and emotion of their patrons. You find this new mode of thought expressed strongly even in the churches and in the treatment of religious subjects. The old ideals were altered. Men no longer painted saints and Madonnas as mild, attenuated people. The figures were lifelike and full of actuality. The women were Venetian women of the period dressed in splendid robes and dignified; the men were healthy, full-blooded, and joyous. Florence, however, at this particular period was undergoing quite a different mood. The Florentines preferred to express themselves in poetry and in prose. That was the language the masses understood. Painting was not popular. There has always been a literary atmosphere about Florence, and one feels it there to this day; it is essentially the city for the student. When painting became so much a vogue in Venice, painters began to try and perfect the art in every possible way. They struggled for actuality. Art began to develop in the direction of realism. The Venetians wanted form and colour in their pictures; but they wanted also a suggestion of distance and atmosphere. In those early pictures you find that painters smeared their distance to give it a blurred look. That was the beginning of perspective. Painters of this period seem to have been marvellously modern. They were quite in the movement. There has never been any attempt at harking back to earlier periods. Venice was very wealthy at this time, and Venetian people never missed an opportunity of parading wealth. They loved glory where the State was concerned, and encouraged pageantry by both land and sea. They loved to see Doge and senators in their gorgeous robes, either on the piazza or on the Grand Canal. Then there came a demand for painted records of these processions and ceremonials. All this was encouraged by the State for political reasons. Pageantry entertained the people, and at the same time made them less inquisitive. Much better, these great officials argued, that the people should be enjoying things in this way than that they should begin to inquire into the doings of the State. Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio were the first pageant painters of the period. Paolo Veronese, who came much later, also loved pageantry, elevated it to the height of serious art, and idealised prosaic magnificence. He painted great banquets, and combined ceremony, splendour, and worldliness with childlike naturalness and simplicity. First of all, as has been shown, it was the Church that called for pictures - to represent their saints and to enforce biblical legends. Painting became more and more popular. People became more and more educated to understand painting, until at last they wanted their domestic and social lives depicted. Also they wanted to hang these pictures in their homes. Pictures were neither so rare nor so expensive in those days as they are now, and people could afford to buy them - even the lower and the middle classes. Immediately there sprang up painters who satisfied the demand. In those days there were no academies and no salons wherein artists fought to outdo one another as to the size and eccentricity of their pictures; there were no vulgar struggles of that kind. Painters simply supplied to the best of their ability the wants of the people. Naturally, the public required small pictures, suitable to the size of their houses. Therefore, they needed gay and beautiful colour, and pictures in which the subjects did not obtrude themselves forcibly. Thus, in the natural course of events pageantry found less favour, and pictures of social and domestic life found more. Religious subjects were rather deserted. By the aid of books people could learn all the stories of the Bible. Besides, they were not at that period in a devotional or contrite mood. They were too happy and full of life to feel any pressing need for religion. Painting took much the same position with the Venetians as music has with us now. The fashion for triumphal marches and the clashing of cymbals in processional pictures had died out, and the vogue of symphonies and sonatas had come in. No one at that time seemed quite capable of satisfying the public taste. Carpaccio, whose subtle yet brilliant colouring would have exactly suited it, never undertook these subjects. Giovanni Bellini attempted them; but his style was too severe for the gaiety of the period. However, there was not long to wait. Soon appeared a man who told the public what they wanted and gave it to them. He swept away conventions and revolutionised art all over the world. He was a genius - Giorgione. Pupil of Bellini and Carpaccio, he combined the qualities of both. When he was quite a youth painters all over the world followed his methods. Curiously enough, there are not a dozen of this great master's works preserved at the present day. The bulk of them were frescoes which long ago disappeared. The few that remain are quite enough to make one realise what a great master he was. The picture which most appeals to me is an altar-piece of the Virgin and Child at Castelfranco. It is painted in the pure Giorgione spirit. St. George in armour is at one side, resting on a spear which seems to be coming right out of the picture; while on the other side there is a monk, and in the background are a banner of rich brocade and a small landscape. The Renaissance, the rejuvenation of art, seems to have slowly developed until at length it culminated in Giorgione. He was the man who opened the door, the one great modern genius of his period, whose influence remains and is felt to this day. Velasquez would never have been known but for Giorgione. Imagine this young man with his new ideas and his sweeps of golden colouring suddenly appearing in a studio full of men, all painting in the correct severe style established at the period. Such a man must needs influence all his fellows. Even Giovanni Bellini, the Watts of his day, acknowledged the young man's genius, and almost unconsciously began to mingle Giorgione's style with his own. We cannot realise what they meant at that period - these new ideas of Giorgione. He created just as much of a \\\"furore\\\" as when Benvenuto Cellini, in his sculpture, allowed a limb to hang over the edge of a pedestal. He needed this to complete his design. Since then almost everyone that has modelled has hung a limb over a pedestal. But Benvenuto Cellini started this new era. So, in much the same sort of way, did Giorgione. He cut away from convention, and introduced landscape as backgrounds to his figure subjects. He was the first to get actuality and movement in the arrangement of drapery. The Venetian public had long been waiting, though unconsciously, for this work; and Giorgione was so well in touch with the needs of the people that the moment he gave them what they wanted they would take nothing else. In the work of Giorgione the Renaissance finds its most genuine expression. It is the Renaissance at its height. Both Giorgione and Titian were village boys brought to Venice by their parents and placed under the care of Giovanni Bellini to learn art. They must have been of very much the same age. It is interesting to watch the career of these boys - the two different natures - the impulsiveness of the one and the plodding perseverance of the other. Giorgione shot like a meteor early and bright into the world of art, scattering the clouds in the firmament, bold, crowding the work and the pleasure of a lifetime in a few short years. His work was a delight to him, and life itself was full of everything that was beautiful. He was surrounded always by a multitude of admiring comrades, imitating him and urging him on. Giorgione was ever restless and impetuous by nature. When commissions flagged and he had no particular work in hand, he took to painting the outside of his own house. He cared not a whit for convention. He followed his own tastes and his own feelings. He converted his home into a glow of crimson and gold, - great forms starting up along the walls, sweet cherub boys, fables of Greece and Rome, - a dazzling confusion of brilliant tints and images. Think how this palace must have appeared reflected in the waters of the Canal! Unfortunately, the sun and the wind fought with this masterly canvas, conquered, and bore all these beautiful things away. Indeed, many of Giorgione's works were frescoes, and the sea air swept away much of the glory of his life. His career was brief but gay, full of work and full of colour. This impetuous painter died in the very heyday of his success. Some say he died of grief at being deserted by a lady whom he loved; others that he caught the plague. Of what a different nature was Titian! He studied in the same bottega as Giorgione, and was brought up under much the same conditions. But he was a patient worker, absorbing the knowledge of everyone about him, ever learning and experimenting; never completing. He did not think of striking off on a new line, of executing bold and original work. He wanted to master not one side of painting but all sides. He waited until his knowledge should be complete before he declared himself, before he really accomplished anything. He absorbed the new principles of his comrade Giorgione, as he absorbed everything else that was good, with unerring instinct and steady power. Titian was never led away in any one direction. He was always open to any new suggestion. As it happened, it was just as well that Titian worked thus at his leisure, and Giorgione with haste and fever. Titian had ninety-nine years to live; Giorgione had but thirty-four. There is an interesting anecdote told by Vasari with regard to these two young men. They were both at work on the painting of a large building, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi; Titian painting the wall facing the street, and Giorgione the side towards the canal. Several gentlemen, not knowing which was the particular work of either artist, went one day to inspect the building, and declared that the wall facing the Merceria far excelled in beauty that of the river front. Giorgione was so indignant at this slight that he declared that he would neither see nor speak to Titian again. Titian does not seem to have been very much appreciated by his patrons at the beginning of his career. He inspired no affection. He was acknowledged as the greatest of all the young painters; but the Republic, it would seem, was never very proud of the man who did her so much credit and added so greatly to her fame. Even although the noise of his genius was echoed all over the world, - although the great Emperor himself stooped to pick up his brush, declaring that a Titian might well be served by a C\\u00e6sar, - although Charles the Fifth sat to him repeatedly, and maintained that he was the only painter whom he would care to honour, - the Venetians do not seem to have been greatly enamoured of him. Perhaps it was that they missed the soul, the purity and grace and devotion, of the pictures of Bellini and Carpaccio. Certainly, as far as one can judge, he did not have a prepossessing nature. He was shifty in his dealings with his patrons and unfaithful in his promises. He seems to have belonged to a corrupt and luxurious society. Pietro Aretino had a very bad influence on Titian. He taught him to intrigue, to flatter, to betray. Aretino was a base-born adventurer for whom no historian seems to have a good word. He was, however, a man of wit and dazzling cleverness, with a touch of real genius. Aretino corresponded with all the most cultured men of his time, and he had the power of making those whom he chose famous. It was he who introduced Titian to Charles the Fifth. Titian's pictures were much more saleable in foreign courts than in his own country. Abroad they did not seem to have the lack of soul which the Venetians so greatly deplored. It was the old case of the prophet having no honour in his own country. Certainly in the art of portraiture Titian has never been surpassed. At that period he had the field completely to himself. Nothing could have been more magnificent than Titian's portraits. They help to record the history of the age. It was in Titian's power to confer upon his subjects the splendour that they loved, handing them down to posterity as heroes and learned persons. His men were all noble, worthy to be senators and emperors, no coxcombs or foolish gallants. Titian was more at home in pictures of this kind than in religious subjects. His Madonnas are without significance; his Holy Families give no message of blessing to the world. In the prime of his life he moved from his workshops to a noble and luxurious palace in San Cassiano, facing the wide lagoon and the islands. All trace of it has disappeared, and homes of the poor cover the garden where the best company of Venice was once entertained. It is said that Titian gave the gayest parties and suppers - that he entertained the most regal guests. Nevertheless, although made a knight and a count, and a favourite at most of the courts in Europe, he was greatly disliked by the Venetian Signoria, who in the midst of his famous supper-parties called upon him to demand that he should execute a certain work for which he had received the money long before. He seems to have been exceedingly grasping - a strange trait in the character of a painter. One sees throughout his correspondence, until the end of his life, a certain desire and demand for money. Undoubtedly he often painted merely for money alone, turning out a sacred picture one day and a Venus the next with equal impartiality. Anything, it was said, could have been got out of Titian for money. The Venetians never loved Titian's works, though foreign princes adored them. He seems to have laboured, until the end of his life, more from love of gain than from necessity. He was buried at the Frari, carried thither in great haste by order of the Signoria, - for it was at the time of the plague, when other victims were taken to the outlying islands and put in the earth unnamed. Somehow, in reading the life of Titian one is brought right away to the twentieth century. Here is the painter with the attendant journalist, Pietro Aretino, the boomer. Aretino was a journalist, the first. He took Titian in hand and \\\"ran\\\" him for all he was worth. Had it not been for this system of booming, Titian would probably not have been well known during his lifetime. In the Academy of the Fine Arts one can trace by his pictures a splendid historical record of Titian's life, and can see plainly the changes in popular feeling and their effect upon his work. For very many years he lived and painted constantly, and then was killed by the plague! There is a picture painted by him when he was fourteen years of age - a picture which contains all the qualities, in the germ, of his later work: marvellous architecture, pomp, yet great simplicity and luminous colour. Here also is the last picture he ever painted - at the age of ninety-nine. Think of the interval between the two! It is sombre, pious. There is something pathetic about it. This great painter, whose work showed such fury, audacity, vehemence, - the man who had always the sun on his palette - was now painting mildly, carefully, obviously with the shadow of approaching death upon him. A marvellous picture by Titian hangs in the Academy of the Fine Arts. It is considered to be one of his finest pictures - the masterpiece of all his masterpieces - the eye of the peacock, as it were. This picture was neglected for many years, hidden away in an obscure portion of a church, and covered with a thick layer of cobwebs and dust. The custodian had almost forgotten the subject of the picture and the name of the painter. One day a certain Count Cicogna happened to visit the church. Being a great connoisseur and lover of art, he noticed this picture, and could not resist moistening his finger and rubbing it over a portion of the canvas. To his amazement, this portion emerged young and fresh, and as highly coloured as when it left the painter's hands - a picture bearing upon it the unmistakable stamp of Titian's genius! The delight of the Count can be imagined. He suggested to the custodian, with great care and tact, that he would present to the church a bran-new glossy picture, very large, of some religious subject; and mentioned in a casual way that they might give him the dilapidated old picture as a slight return. This was the Assunta. It was painted for the church of the Frari. Fra Marco Jerman, the head of the convent, ordered it at his own expense. Many a time when the work was in progress he and all the ignorant brethren visited the painter's studio and criticised his picture, grumbling and shaking their heads, and wondering whether it would be good enough to be accepted, whether it would be sneered at when uncovered before all Venice. They undoubtedly thought that they had done a rash thing in engaging him. Think of the agony of Titian, hindered by these ignorant men, being forced to explain elaborately that the figures were not too large, that they must needs be in proportion to the space! It was not until the envoy of the Emperor had seen the picture and declared it to be a masterpiece, offering a large sum of money for its purchase, that the Frari understood its value, and decided that, as the buying and selling of pictures was not in their profession, they had better keep it. Tintoretto painted, according to the popular feeling of his period, for the good of mankind. This we certainly owe to the Renaissance - the desire to benefit mankind, and not only men individually. Tintoretto felt this strongly. One sees not only the effect of this new era of thought in his work: one sees also human life at the base of it. Tintoretto worked for the good of mankind, and his work throbs with humanity. There was atmosphere, reality, in it. He was, it is true, a pupil of Titian; but it was Michael Angelo whose works had the greatest attraction for him. He loved Angelo's overwhelming power and gigantic force. Tintoretto's pictures seem to possess much of the glowing colour of Titian; but he paid greater attention to chiaroscuro. He seems to have had the power of lowering the tone of a sky to suit his composition of light and shade. His conception of the human form was colossal. His work showed a wide sweep and power. He turned to religion, not because it was a duty, but because it answered the needs of the human heart - because it helped him to forget the mean and sordid side of life, braced him to his work, and consoled him in his days of despair. The Bible was not to him a cut-and-dried document concerning the Christian religion, but a series of beautiful parables pointing to a finer life. Then, Tintoretto asked himself, Why keep to the old forms and the old ideals? Why should the saints and biblical people be represented as Romans, walking in a Roman background? He himself thought of them as people of his own kind, and painted them as such. Thus, he argued, people became more familiar with the Bible, more readily understood it. Tintoretto painted portraits not only of Venetians, but also of foreign princes. Although he painted with tremendous rapidity, the demand was greater than the supply. His paintings were popular. They gave pleasure to the eye, and stimulated the emotions. He painted people at their best, in glowing health and full of life. Under his marvellous brush old men became vigorous and full-blooded. His pictures give the same sort of pleasure as one finds in looking upon a casket of jewels - they are just as deathless in their brilliancy. The portrait that the popular taste called forth in Titian's day was just about as unlike the typical modern portrait as you could possibly imagine, - the colourless, cold, unsympathetic portrait of the fish-eyed mayor in his robes. At the age of fifteen, Jacopo Robusti - tintoretto, the little dyer - was brought by his father, Battista Robusti, to the studio of the great painter Titian. There he stayed for a little while, until one day Titian came across, in his bottega, some drawings that showed promise. On discovering that they were from the hand of Jacopo, he sent the boy away. Young as he was, Tintoretto had all the arrogance of the well-to-do citizen. He would brook no man's No, and would not yield his own pretensions for the greatest genius in Christendom. He did not need money: he was independent: and he started boldly to teach himself. Boiling with rage at the affront Titian had put upon him, he was determined to make a career for himself. He studied the works of Michael Angelo and of Titian, and inscribed upon his studio wall, so that his ambition might always be before his eyes, \\\"Il desegno di Michael Angelo, e' il colorito di Titiano.\\\" He studied casts of ancient marbles, and made designs of them by the light of a lamp, in order to gain a strong effect of shadow. Also, he copied the pictures of Titian. Seeking, by every means in his power, to educate himself, he modelled figures of wax and plaster, upon which he hung his drapery. And always, whether painting by night or by day, he arranged his lights so as to have everything in high relief. Tintoretto's inventions for teaching himself were endless. Often he visited the painters' benches in the piazza of St. Mark's, where the poor men of the profession worked at painting chests and furniture of all kinds. In those days there were too many painters. The profession was overdone. Many young men who had real genius worked at the benches. Titian was the great man at the moment, and Palma Vecchio. But Tintoretto did not care. He forced his work down men's throats - gave it to them for nothing if they would not pay for it. He was always ready with his brush, and would paint anything from an organ to an altar-piece. He worked like a giant, with tremendous sweep and power; no subject was too great or too laborious; and always he had a desire to do his best. Tintoretto would not be trifled with or condescended to. He would not have his work under-valued, and would allow no patrician, not even a prince, to play the patron to him. He was determined not to be set aside. He flung his pictures at people's heads, and insisted on undertaking any great piece of work there was to do. Thus, Tintoretto's pictures are to be seen everywhere in Venice - in almost every church, every council-hall, every humble chapel, every parish church, every sacristy. He neglected no opportunity to make his work known. He worked with extraordinary rapidity. Whenever Tintoretto came across a fine fair wall he prevailed upon the master-mason to allow him to paint it. A fifty-foot space he would cover with avidity, asking nothing for his work but the cost of the material, giving his time and labour as a gift. Portraiture was the outcome of realism, and one of the most important discoveries of the Renaissance. People began to feel that they wanted not only their affluence in possessions, but also their own individual faces and features, handed down to posterity. Thus portraiture began to creep in. At first it appeared in the churches under cover of saints and Madonnas; gradually it became possible to distinguish one from another - it was not always the same face. Painters took models from life as their saints. But portraiture in painting was very slow in reaching perfection. Sculpture had accomplished that long before; now that the latest craze was for portraiture, it was the sculptors who were the most prepared to take it up, and stepped forward to execute commissions. They had plenty of material in the way of old Roman coins and busts. Donatello and Vittore Pisano were the two men who first offered to satisfy the new want. Donatello executed marvellous studies of character, and Pisano medals such as have never been seen before or since. But even these men, fine as their work undoubtedly was, felt that the public could not long remain satisfied merely with the sculptured portrait. They must have colour. Donatello, therefore, began to stain and colour his busts, showing that painting, not sculpture, was to be the portrait art of the Renaissance. Vittore Pisano also gave up his sculpture, and turned his attention to portrait-painting; but he was only an amateur in this direction, and did not meet with much success. No portrait-painter of any merit was produced in that generation. The idea was entirely new. Men had not had sufficient time in which to study the human face. The next generation ushered in Mantegna, who painted a marvellous portrait of Cardinal Sciramo; but he went too far in the other direction. He painted his man as he was - as he saw him, line for line. He painted the soul and heart of him - and the soul and the heart were black. Venice was revolted with such a portrait. It seemed indeed indecent that a man's character should be laid bare in such a way. It was a picture they did not care to hang in the Council Chamber, a picture that was unpleasant to live with. The Cardinal belonged to the State. His honour was their honour, and it must not be defiled. The Venetians came to the conclusion that portraits must be painted not in full-face but in profile. Thus the characteristics of a man, if they be not pleasant, do not come out clearly. This accounts for the number of profile portraits. The age wanted an agreeable portrait. This Giorgione provided. He realised that the treatment must always be bright, joyous, romantic. His followers trod in his footsteps: the master's style was too strong and pronounced to be much deviated from. Giorgione seems to have reached the topmost height of art at that period. Even Titian, for a generation after his death, followed in Giorgione's lines; only, Titian's work was a little more sober, a little less sunny. He had the sense to see that Giorgione had expanded the old rule and done something worth adopting, and for a time he simply followed this joyful outburst. His early years fell at a time when life was glowing, radiant, almost intoxicating in its vigour. But youth and joy cannot last; nor could the Renaissance spirit. Gradually the trouble and the strife from which the whole of Italy was suffering filtered into Venice, and cast a serious aspect over art and social life. Venice, of all the states in Italy, was the last to feel this sobering influence. She had been defeated both in battle and in commerce; and, although she was not totally crushed under the heel of Spain, life was not the endless holiday it promised to be. Men took themselves more seriously, and the quieter pleasures of friendship and affection began to be more sought after. Religion revived in importance. Men clung to it, as they always do in time of trouble, for comfort and support. It was no longer a political sentiment, but a personal one. Art declined as the sunshine and the gaiety that had fed and nourished it ebbed away. When men began to feel that individually they were of no avail, that they were subject to the powers round about and above them, the death-blow of great art fell. Titian was influenced by his environment, and his painting changed completely. He produced pictures that would have been looked upon with scorn in his earlier days. The faces of his men are no longer smooth and free from care. One saw there struggle and suffering, and all that life had done for them. But Titian was not a pessimist at heart. The joy and gaiety in which he had been brought up formed part of his character. Whatever changes may have happened to his country politically, nothing could alter that entirely. And it was no doubt this early training and the atmosphere in which he was brought up that made his pictures the masterpieces they were. You notice the men who came after Titian - how they began to decline. For example, Lorenzo Lotto had been brought up in the heyday of the Renaissance; but the new order of things, the change from national virility to national decadence, enfeebled him. Then, again, the coming in touch with poets and men of letters, victims flying from the fury of Spain, was a new stimulant to art. It did not exactly improve it; but it certainly changed it. A fine period of painting does not come in a day, nor does it end in a day; and, although the universal interest in the Venetian school dies with Titian and Tintoretto, it does not die unnoticed. The torch of art flickered up many times in Venice before it was finally extinguished. The men who came immediately after Tintoretto had not the strength to start off on any new lines. They simply fell back on variations of the earlier masters, showing much of the masters' weaknesses, but few of their great qualities. Some even were so inartistic as to attempt to pass off their pictures, on ignorant people, as Titians and Giorgiones. However, before the Republic disappeared there were two or three men who took the first rank among the painters of the period, provincial artists, men whose art was sufficiently like her own to be readily understood, such as Paul Veronese. The provinces were not declining so rapidly as Venice was. They were less troubled by the approaching storm. Men there led simple, healthy lives; Spanish manners were long in reaching the provinces, and, when they did, the people were slow to succumb. Men in the provinces had stamina, simplicity, and courage with which to meet the new order of things. They combined ceremony and splendour with childlike naturalness. Consequently, the works of Paul Veronese delighted the Venetians. The more fashionable and ceremonious private life in the city became, the more were the people charmed with his simple rendering. Gradually the taste of the Venetians turned towards pictures in humble quarters - in the provincial towns and in the country. In the Middle Ages the country was so upset that it was not safe for people to venture out of the city; but with the advance of civilisation this state of affairs was altered. People began to delight in country life. The aristocracy took villas in the provinces, and the poorer people wanted representations of them in their houses. The painters of the period, Palma and Bonifacio, began to add pastoral backgrounds to their works. But the first great landscape painter was Jacopo Bassano. His treatment of light and atmosphere was masterly, and his colouring was jewel-like and brilliant. It was Bassano who started that great Spanish school which was to culminate in Velasquez. Venice did not produce many great painters in the eighteenth century - only three or four. The city itself remained unchanged: it was just as beautiful, still the most beautiful and luxurious city in the world: it was the people who changed. They became apathetic, placid, and drifting, perfectly contented with one another and with their lots in life, never trying to better themselves in any way. There were no difficulties, no problems to be solved. People were just as gay as they were serious, just as much interested in paintings as they were in politics. This was a vegetable period. It is strange that such a demoralising time should have seen the rise of a great master; but it certainly saw him in Canaletto. That artist differed from nearly all the Venetian painters in that he had complete mastery of technique. His work is just as fine technically as that of Velasquez or that of Rembrandt. It shows marvellous dexterity and power. He understood his materials better than any other Venetian painter - better even than Giorgione. Guardi and Tiepolo followed Canaletto. In Tiepolo's work especially you realise the character of these eighteenth-century people. At that time Venice was sliding downhill rapidly. Her people were aping dignity. They dressed extravagantly, not so much for the love of colour and splendour as for swagger. They were degenerating rapidly. Here and there lesser masters appeared; but Venetian art became poorer and poorer, until it reached the condition of the present day, when in Venice there is no art at all. The kind of work which the people appreciate sickens and saddens you - those sunlit photographs glazed with blue to counterfeit moonlight, and tricky, vicious water-colours, - brutal pictures with metallic reflections and cobalt skies, - all wonderfully alike, all with the same orange sail, and all equally untrue. Year by year painters continue to paint Venice without the public showing signs of weariness. Perhaps the failure of the artists to reproduce the undying charm of that dazzling jewel of cities is both the excuse and the reason for the pertinacity of the tribe. Womanlike, she eludes them; manlike, they pursue. Few have seen the real Venice, the Venice of Ruskin and Turner and Whistler. Venice is not for the cold-blooded spectator, for the amateur or the art dabbler: she is for the enthusiastic colourist and painter, the man who sees, and does not merely look. Sir Edward Burne-Jones was wont to declare that to paint Venice as she should be painted one must needs live for three thousand years: the first thousand should be devoted to experiments in various media; the second to producing works and destroying them; the third to completing slowly the labour of centuries. He would never have dreamed of spending a painting holiday beyond Italy - that is, unless he had been permitted to live for over five thousand years; and even then, it was his firm opinion, no man could paint St. Mark's, which was unpaintable - mere pigment could not suggest it. \\n\\nSTREETS, SHOPS, AND COURTYARDS\\n\\nIn the crooked and bewildering streets of Venice, which open out from the great piazza and lead all over the city, one sees the true life of the people. It is there that the poor congregate. The houses teem with humanity. There the true Venetians are harboured. One comes to know them well, and the manner of life they lead; and so gay and light-hearted are they, it is strange if one does not like them in spite of all their faults. Was there ever more irregularity than in the streets of Venice? All the houses seem to be differently constructed. Some are lofty; others are squat; some have balconies and chimney-pieces thrust out into the street so as almost to touch the houses opposite. Nearly every house has at one time been a palace, and each is in a different stage of decay - houses that have once been the homes of merchant princes, palaces in which perhaps even Petrarch may have feasted, - inhabited now by the poorest of Venetians. The weekly wash flutters from the balconies (the linen of Venice is famed for its whiteness), and frowsy heads appear at Gothic windows. Worms have eaten and rust has corrupted everything destructible. Yet now and then one is astonished at the preservation of certain portions of the buildings. In that labyrinth of streets one never knows what surprise may be in store. You will come across beautiful early-Gothic gateways covered with sculptured relief and inlaid designs of leaves; a fourteenth-century palace with the faint remains of the paintings of some artist with which at one time it must have been covered; lovely remnants of crosses let into the walls; Renaissance wells of the sixteenth century; delicately-carved parapets; a great stone angel standing guardian at some calle head; irregularly twisted staircases of the fifteenth century; a Gothic door with terra-cotta mouldings; and churches without number. Some of the finest architectural gems in Europe are here, and almost every house is invested with a strange history. The place seems inexhaustible. As you walk in those old streets the shadows of the mighty dead go with you - those great men who lived glorious lives for Venice and for art. There is an old-world atmosphere about the streets. They twist and turn, and sometimes are so narrow that there is scarcely room for two people to pass each other; at times they are so dark and still that the scuttling of a rat into the water makes one start. Venice is full of contrasts, full of the unexpected. It is as if Providence, seeing fit that one's eyes should not become satiated with beauty unalloyed, throws in little marring touches - shocks to your feelings, cold douches of water, as it were - in order to give value to the marvellous colouring and antiquity of the water city. For example, from the world of Desdemona, where one can fancy one sees her lean from a traceried window and catch a distant echo of a mellow voice out on the water singing a serenade, it is rather a shock suddenly to find yourself in the piazza of St. Mark. It is easy to lose oneself in the streets of Venice. In a minute you can step from the past to the present, and find yourself among the marbles of St. Mark's and the arcades of the Ducal Palace - in the tourist's Venice, amid glittering shops full of modern atrocities, mosaic jewellery, wood-carving, imitation glass, and what not - Americans and other globe-trotters staring up at St. Mark's, laughing and reading their guide-books. For all artists and lovers of the picturesque the side streets of Venice - calle, as they are called - are fascinating beyond words. Every house has a character peculiarly its own. Each is in a way unique and totally dissimilar to its fellows; each is proud in the possession of relics of architectural beauties. Every street is made up of magnificent palaces and churches, fine examples of architecture in such rich and varied wealth and diversity of styles that one is almost overpowered. There are old Gothic palaces, venerable specimens of Renaissance or Venetian period. Time indeed has laid heavy hands upon them; but it seems to have augmented their charm. This homely aspect of Venice interests. The old houses and the rickety archways appeal to the observer, if he be not too keen of smell. Here are marvellous and varied combinations of rich colouring - weather-worn bricks, grated windows, and brilliant shutters picturesque and shabby by the lapse of time, and shops half lost in gloom. Most of the houses are of distempered rose-colour at the top and moss-green at the bottom. The sun shines on the roof, and the water laps at the base. There are land-gates and water-gates to most of the houses - one opening upon a canal, the other upon a courtyard. I lived for six months in Venice, and have seen these streets under every possible aspect. I have seen them in the early morning, at mid-day, in the evening, at night, in the rain, in the sun; and I can never decide at what time of the day they appear most fascinating. Perhaps it is after a rain-shower, when every tone upon the old walls is brought out and accentuated - greys and pale sea-greens and the old Venetian red with which so many of the houses used to be distempered. The shops in Venice are very thickly set. Most of them open right down to the ground, and the wares, which are varied, appear to ooze out into the street. Here is a corn-dealer's shop with open sacks of polenta flour of every shade of yellow; there a green-grocer's shop where vegetables are sold - such a wealth of colour in the piles of tomatoes, vegetable marrows, and great pumpkins cut down the middle to display their orange cores. The richer shops, however, are blocked up several feet high, and have latticed windows. I love to wander through these streets at night, when the squalor and the misery of Venetian life are hidden by the darkness, and one sees only beauty. Here are subjects for the etcher, for Rembrandt and Frans Hals, - marvellous effects of light and shade. The streets are pitch-dark; there is nothing to mar the lovely fair blue nights of Venice - no vicious shaft of electric light to bleach the colour from the sky. These side streets are lit by the candle and the lamp. Perhaps the most picturesque of all the shops at night are the wine-shops. There one sees, beneath some low blackened doorway, a rich golden-brown interior. In the midst of this golden gloom one dim oil-lamp is burning - the most perfect light possible from the painter's standpoint: by it, the dark faces and gesticulating hands of the men gathered round a table are turned to deep orange. This is all one sees growing from out the encircling gloom - faces, hands, and a few flecks of ruby light, as the glasses are raised. Every shop down these narrow streets has its shrine to the Virgin Mary, with its statuette, its fringes, and its flowers; and at night these shrines are illuminated according to the poverty or the wealth of the proprietor - some have only a tiny dip, others have a candle or a group of candles, while well-to-do folk boast a row of oil-lamps. Rich or poor, each has its offering, its tiny beacon. The children may go without bread, and the mother may lack warm clothing; but the Holy Mother must not be robbed of her due. There is certainly a wonderful simplicity of faith about these people. The cook-shops are fascinating by night. There are innumerable stalls; in fact, nearly all the shopping seems to be done from stalls; even the butchers have open-air stalls. At night chestnut-roasters, toffee-vendors, pumpkin-and-hot-pear men hold full sway. These are generally surrounded by groups of open-mouthed children gazing with delight at the long twisted strings of toffee in the hands of the operator. Almost a still greater attraction to the young folk of Venice is the chestnut-roaster; he generally takes up his position in the courtyards, as does the coffee-roaster. Courtyards seem to be the favourite haunts of the coffee-roasters, - partly, I suppose, because all the doors of the houses round about open into them, and housewives can be easily supplied. They seem to be constantly roasting coffee berries night and day; the whole place reeks with the fragrant odour. They are picturesque by day, these busy workers, but far more picturesque by night, when the gleam of their ovens shows orange in the purple gloom, and the leaping flames light up the faces of the children round about, handsome little faces with a certain grandeur in them - boys with bronze cheeks, dark hair, olive complexions, black eyes, and sometimes a touch of colour in their red flannel caps and their multicoloured patches of garments. There is something barbaric and fine and graceful about them, half-encircled, as they are, by the filmy blue smoke from the ovens. A Venetian Good Friday celebrated in a poor and populous part of Venice at night is most picturesque. The people of the quarter - the coffee-roasters, the cook-shop men, the footmen, and the wine-sellers - arrange to sing a chant in twenty-four verses, a grave and sombre chant following the life of our Lord in His Passion. Each verse takes about five minutes to sing, and there is a pause of equal length between each two verses. During every interval the crowd, who have been quiet, begin to chatter, the men smoke, and the boys rush and tumble. Directly the precentor begins, silence falls upon them once more. Most of the people in that particular quarter subscribe to the erection of a shrine with plenty of candles and little glass lamps. It is a picturesque sight - the yellow light from the altar lamps falling on the group of men and women gathered round the singers and the many heads thrust out of windows and balconies, on the fair, devout, and serious faces of the children, on the handsome women and the bronze-faced men. All the world in Venice lives out of doors: they breakfast and lunch and dine, all in the open air. All of them live in lodgings or hotels, and principally in the bedrooms, which are for the most part comfortless and dreary, - their only merits are a frescoed ceiling, sometimes really fine and old, and a balcony. One can procure a marvel of a palace in Venice for the cost of a garret in London. There is no real home-life in Venice. Rich and poor, mothers, fathers, children, and servants, - all take their food in the open air. There are restaurants and caf\\u00e9s for the well-to-do, endless eating-houses for the poorer classes, and sausage-makers for the gondoliers. Cookshops swarm. There you see great piles of fish and garlic, bowls of broth, polenta, and stewed snails, roast apples, boiled beans, cabbages, and potatoes. Every holiday, every saint's day, has its special dish. Carnival time sets the fashion for beaten cream or panamonlata; at San Martino gingerbread soldiers are popular; and for Christmas time there is candy made with honey and almonds. A certain broth consumed by the very humblest is made from scraps of meat which even the sausage-makers will not use: as may be imagined, the soup is highly flavoured. In the midst of all these stalls and eating-houses it is extraordinary how little there is eaten in Venice, - merely a mouthful here and there, - a kind of light running meal. A Venetian, no matter how rich he might be, would never dream of inviting you to a set meal. There is no heavy food, no cut from the joint. If a Venetian invites you to an entertainment, he will give you a cup of coffee perhaps, or a glass of wine and a biscuit, - rarely more. He will never invite you to eat a great meal; he never takes it himself. The eating-house and the stall appear to be more or less of an excuse for gossip and the meeting of neighbours. If the streets of Venice are bewitching by night, they are certainly delightful in the early morning. It is then that one receives the most vivid impressions. There is a certain freshness in one's perceptions at the dawn. The poor wretches who make their beds in the streets, or on the steps, or at the base of columns, shake themselves and shamble off. Troops of ragged \\\"facchini\\\" fill the streets, and quarrel noisily over their work. The great cisterns in the market-place are open, and the water is brought round to your house by dealers, stout young girls with broad backs and rosy cheeks; they carry it in two brass buckets attached to a pole, and empty it into large earthenware pots placed ready for its reception in the kitchen. These girls, called \\\"bigolanti,\\\" supply the place of water-works. At this hour you see the shops opening like so many flowers before the sun. Butchers set forth their meat; fruit shops, crockery shops, bakers', cheap-clothing, and felt-hat shops, show their various wares. You see peasants at work among vegetables, building cabbages and carrots into picturesque piles, and decorating them with garlic and onions, while their masters are still sleeping on sacks of potatoes. Great barges arrive from Mestre, Chioggia, and Torcello, laden with vegetables and fruit. Eating-houses begin their trade. You see men and women taking their breakfast, and a savoury smell of spaghettis and eels on gridirons fills the air. Gondoliers begin to wash their gondolas, brush their felces, polish the iron of their prows, shake their cushions, and put everything in order for business. Picturesque old women, carrying milk in fat squat bottles, make the round of the hotels and restaurants at this early hour. They are good to look at, with their dark nut-brown faces and dangling gold earrings under their large straw hats. Their figures are much the shape of their bottles; and they bring a pleasant atmosphere into Venice, an atmosphere of fields and clover-scented earth, and milk drawn from the cream-coloured cows. Fishermen, a handsome class, with weather-beaten faces, in blue clothing, come striding down the calle, shallow baskets of fish on their heads. They set up their stalls and display their soles and mackerel, chopping up their eels into sections and crying, \\\"Beautiful, and all alive!\\\" At this hour everyone is making bargains, and the result is a continual buzz; but there is nothing discordant about the street cries of Venice. A peculiarly beautiful cry is that of the man who comes round every morning with wood for your kitchen fire. The fuel-men cut their wood on the shores of the Adriatic, and anchor their barges at the Custom House, leaving them in charge of mongrel yellow dogs, who guard so vigilantly and are so extremely aggressive that never a splinter is taken from the barges. The street cries are full of individuality, and the tradesman brings a little art to bear on the description of his wares. The song of the sweep, exquisitely sad, quite befits the warning, \\\"Beware of your chimney!\\\" There is nothing gay about the sweep: he is a very melancholy person, and his expression is in sympathy with his music. The pumpkin-vendor is coy, and his cry has a winning pathos; his is not an easy vegetable to launch on the market, and he has developed into a very bashful person. His cry is cooing and subtle: he almost caresses you into buying, which is necessary, as no one in his right senses really desires a pumpkin. The fruiterer is different. He is handsome, fat-cheeked, and has scarlet lips, strong black hair curling in ringlets, and gold rings in his ears. His adjuration is a round, full, resonant roar, like a triumphant hymn; and there is altogether a certain Oriental splendour about his demeanour. It is not necessary for him to be subtle: there is always a sale for melons and pears, chestnuts and pomegranates. He uses colour as a stimulant to his customers, and dwells upon the hue of his fruit. \\\"Melons with hearts of fire!\\\" he cries. Also he flatters. To a dear old gentleman passing by he will hold up a clump of melons, some of them sliced, or a group of richly coloured pomegranates, and say, \\\"Now, you as a man of taste will appreciate this marvellous colour; you are young enough to understand the fire and beauty of these melons\\\"; and the old gentleman will go on his way feeling quite pleased and youthful. Some of the cries are quaint. I once heard a man say, \\\"Juicy pears that bathe your beard!\\\" and another said his peaches were \\\"ugly but good,\\\" - they certainly were not beautiful to look upon. Almost the most melodious salesmen are the countrymen who pace the streets with larks and finches in cages, and roses and pinks in pots. At mid-day the streets are enveloped in a warm golden light; there are rich old browns, orange yellows, and burnt siennas - all the tints of a gorgeous wall-flower. A ray of sun in a bric-\\u00e0-brac shop attracts your attention; and you get a peep through a window with cobwebbed panes, high up in a flesh-coloured wall, at some of the objects within, - brass pots and pans gleam from the walls, bits of china and porcelain, strings of glass beads, some quaint old bookcases with saints carved in ivory, fragments of old brocade woven with gold and gorgeous, - all kinds of strange curiosities, looking crisp and brilliant in the sunlight. Suddenly you are blinded by a patch of golden yellow. It is an orange-stall placed before a pink palace flecked with the delicate tracery of luminous violet shadow. Away down in the interior of the stall, where the sun does not shine, it appears almost purple by contrast to the brilliant mass of golden fruit. The background of all these shops is neutral: the objects for sale form the only brilliant and positive colour. The palaces and houses are mostly pink and white. There are pinks, and greys, and blues, and so on. It is not the painted, coloured city that one had imagined it to be: Venice is very grey. But its greyness is that of the opal and the pearl. I have often heard people say how strange it is that the colours always seem brighter in Venice than in any other city - the shutters and the doors and the shops. The answer is not far to seek. It is because the background and the general colouring is neutral. There are no large patches of positive colour: even St. Mark's, choke-full of colour as it is, has no positive colour in its composition. Take a peep into a carpenter's shop. Through the iron grating, rusty and red with age, you see the quaint old craftsman at work, his flesh tone very much the colour of the wood he is planing; piercing black eyes look through and over the large bone-framed glasses that he wears; he suggests the carpenter of Japan; and, judging from the amount of shavings you see about the floor, you gather that he is a dignified, not what may be called a feverish, worker. He is, however, evidently an artist: you see dainty specimens of wood-carving hung round on the walls. Most of the carpenters of Venice seem to be old men. There appear to be very few middle-aged people at all. They seem to be either young boys and girls or ancient men and women. Whether it is that Venetians age quickly, I do not know. The old women are extraordinary. You can scarcely imagine how anything so crooked and foul and old and frowsy, with so little hair, so few teeth, so many protruding bones, and such parchment-like skin, can be human. Their faces seem to be shrunken like old fruit: I have seen women with noses shrivelled and with dents in them like strawberries. It is extraordinary to watch these women on their shopping excursions. How they bargain! They think nothing of starting the day before to buy a piece of steak, and sometimes spend a whole day haggling over it. Some of the shopmen are swindlers, - fat, greasy men, very fresh and brisk, who have reduced cheating to a fine art. It is only after living in Venice for some months that one begins to understand the bargaining in the streets. You will see two men talking - one the shopman, the other the purchaser - and if you know anything of the language, and watch carefully, you will find it the most marvellous bit of acting imaginable. They bargain; the customer turns in scorn, and goes; he is called back; the goods are displayed once more, and their merits expatiated upon. The customer laughs incredulously and moves away. The seller then tries other tactics to fog his client. Eventually he makes a low offer, which is accepted; but even then the shopman gets the best of it, for he has a whole battery of the arts of measurement in reserve. There is really no end to the various possibilities of \\\"doing\\\" a man out of a halfpenny. Beggars are a great trial in the streets. The lame, the halt, and the blind breathe woe and pestilence under your window, and long monotonous whines of sorrow. Fat friars in spectacles and bare feet come round once a month begging bread and fuel for the convents. Old troubadours serenade you with zithers, strumming feebly with fingers that seem to be all bone, and in thin quavering voices pipe out old ditties of youth and love. There are lottery offices everywhere. Around them there is always a great excitement. The missing number, printed on a card framed in flowers and ribands, is placed in the windows daily. Some say that the system of lottery should be done away with; but it might be cruel to deprive the poor wretches of hope. The lottery brings joy to many despairing people. Venetian women are good-looking. One sees them continually about the streets. Nothing can surpass the grace of the shawl-clad figures seen down the perspective of the long streets, or about some old stone well in a campiello. They are for the most part smart and clean. You see them coming home from the factories, nearly always dressed in black, simple and well-behaved. Their hair is of a crisp black, and well tended; their manner is sedate and demure. There is no boisterousness about the Venetian girls, no turning round in the streets, no coarseness. Many of them are very beautiful. You see a woman crossing an open space with the sunlight gleaming on the amber beads about her throat and making the rich colour glow brighter beneath her olive skin. A shawl is thrown round her shoulders, and her jet-black hair is fastened by a silver pin. She wears a deep crimson bodice. The choice of colour of these women is unerring in taste. Their shawls are seldom gaudy, generally of blue or pale mauve; vivid colours are reserved for the bodices. Then, there are the bead-stringers. You see them everywhere: handsome girls with a richness of southern colour flushing beneath warm-toned skins, eyes large and dark, with heavy black lashes, the hair twisted in knots low on their necks, and swept back in large waves from square foreheads, a string of coloured beads round their necks, and flowered linen blouses with open collars. You see them with their wooden trays full of beads. The bead-stringers are nearly always gay. They laugh and chat as they run the beads on the strings. They often form a very pretty picture, as they bend over their work and thread turquoise beads from wooden trays. In the courtyards, some women are hanging white clothes on a line before a yellow wall; others are leaning out of their windows, gossiping with neighbours. Never was there a more gossiping set of women: every window, every balcony, seems to be thronged with heads thrust out to chatter. Venice is divided up into campi or squares. Each campo has a church, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick-maker, and everything else that is necessary to life, including a caf\\u00e9 and a market. Venetian children, as a rule, are very badly reared, and many of them die at an early age. It is a belief and a consolation that the little ones go straight to heaven, there to plead their parents' cause and to arrange for their reception. May is the best month in which to see the streets. The intoxication of spring is in the air, and in the bright sunlight the colours burn and glow. Although you cannot see them, you are constantly reminded that there are gardens in Venice. Suddenly over the red brickwork of a high wall you will see clumps of tamarisk, hanging mauve wisteria, or the scarlet buds of a pomegranate, while the scent of syringa and banksia roses fills the air, the birds sing in the enclosure, and the perfume of honeysuckle trails over the wall of a garden of a foreign prince. Few crowds are more cheerful or better ordered than a Venetian crowd. There is a light-heartedness about these people that is very engaging; they have a marvellous frankness of manner, a sublime indifference to truth. The smallest Venetian child is a born flatterer, and will tell you, not what he thinks, but what he imagines you wish to hear. The people are the most engaging in the world, free from care or doubt as to right or wrong. This carelessness is characteristic of the whole Italian race. Venetians give the impression of being always determined to enjoy life to the full. They are continually coming together, for the purpose of pleasure, on one pretence or another, and the flashes of wit in the street are sometimes very amusing. The Venetians have always been, and still are, a great festa-loving people. When the Republic fell, the brave ceremonies came to an end; but the original passion is still kept alive. The festa in Venice are chiefly of religious character. For example, once a year each parish church honours the feast of its patron saint by processions to all shrines within that particular parish. Very picturesque are the streams of priests and people crossing the bridges and passing along the fondanta of some small canal, - a brilliant ribbon of vermilion and gold winding through the grey-toned city: porters of the church (in blouses of white, red, and blue) bearing candles, pictures, and banners; bands playing the gayest operatic tunes; priests and the parocco carrying the Host under a canopy of cloth of gold; long files of the devout holding candles; and boys with crackers and guns. At night there is dancing in the largest campo of the parish. On Good Friday the streets resemble a feast rather than a fast. The people are in their best and gaudiest clothes; children are rushing and romping and turning somersaults, whirling their rattles, fitting up shrines and then appealing to the crowd for coppers, - human mites of six or seven constructing \\\"Santo Sepolcro,\\\" or Holy Graves, from old bottles, sprigs of bay stuck in, and odd candle-ends. One may witness touches of sentiment in a Venetian crowd; but the depths are seldom stirred. Sometimes sentiment finds expression in the rilotti - popular Venetian songs. \\n\\nTHE ISLANDS OF THE LAGOON\\n\\nThere is no piece of water more extraordinary than the lagoons of Venice. They cover an area of 184 square miles of water, shut off from the sea by a narrow strip of sandy islands, which are called the Lidi. The form of the lagoons is, roughly, that of a bent bow. How did they happen to be formed thus? That is a difficult question, and there are various opinions. Certainly the lagoons are a great feature of the city. They gave shelter to the founders flying from the Huns on the mainland, and the health of the community depends on their regular ebb and flow. A lagoon is not a lake; neither is it a swamp, nor open sea. It is a strange piece of natural engineering. There are really, although we cannot see them at high tide, four distinct water systems, with separate watersheds and confluent streams. The sea comes in once a day as from a great heart, pulsing in through the four breaks in the Lido barrier, cleaning and purifying the lagoon, and afterwards bearing away the refuse of the city. At low tide one can see these channels distinctly winding in and out of the mud-banks. In the spring they are bare, with long trails of sea-grass. In autumn they are brown and bare, and at high tide the whole surface is flooded. On the mainland shore of the lagoon there is a certain territory, called Laguna Morta, where the sea and the land fight a continual battle. It is the home of the wildfowl. Here salt sea-grasses grow, tamarisk, samphire, and, in the autumn, sea lavender. Farther, the ground becomes solid, and the Venetian plain begins, with its villas, poplars, vineyards, and mulberry groves. Nothing is more delightful than to spend a whole long day upon the lagoon when the air is sweet and the breeze is fresh from the Lido. There are fishing-boats coming in from their long night, with spoil for the Rialto market, crossing and recrossing one another as they tack. The bows are painted, and the nets are hung mast-high to be mended and dried in the sun. Their sails are folded close together, like the wings of great vermilion moths. These sails, which are picturesque in the Venetian landscape, are of the deepest oranges and reds, rich red browns, orange yellows, and burnt siennas, contrasting strangely with the cool grey waters of the lagoon upon which they float. One can wander for miles along the Lido on the Adriatic side. The lizards bask in the hot sand; the delicate, pale sea-holly mingles with the yellow of the evening primrose. From the Lido you can see right away to the south-east, and in the horizon can discern the faint blue hills above Trieste and the top of Monte Maggiore. From there the city looks well: one sees the Ducal Palace, faintly pink, the green woods of the public gardens, and the vast blue Venetian sky. The true native seems to have a strange affection for the Lido. One cannot tell why or wherefore; but it is so - \\\"Lido\\\" has ever been a name to conjure with. One cannot tell what associations and sensations of pleasure and charm are connected with it. At the present day it is a flat piece of somewhat marshy ground, with large gardens intersected by canals. The woods of the Favorita, on the shore of San Elizabetta, are delightful, with their groves of acacia and catalpas, where the ground is carpeted with wild flowers, and the grass is greener than elsewhere in Venice, and the nodding violets grow. Behind the acacia grove there is a Protestant burial-ground where rest the bones of many Englishmen who came to Venice for pleasure and stayed to die. The tomb of our ambassador, Sir Francis Vincent, is here. A beautiful walk is towards the ramparts of San Nicolo, where the blackbirds sing in the old convent garden, and in summer crimson poppies, purple salvias, and vivid green grass are luxuriant. San Nicolo di Bari is the patron saint of sailors. They have erected a magnificent church dedicated to his memory on the most beautiful point of the Lido. Here the crews of the merchantmen and warships of the Republic would linger for a while before sailing, to ask a blessing on their voyage. The saint's remains do not really rest here. Venice failed in her endeavour to obtain them by force from the people of Bari; but she spread the fiction among the people. To this day the sailors of the lagoon firmly believe that San Nicolo still watches over and protects them, and when in doubt or danger are enabled by the campanile of his church to find the direct course to the Lido port. At the Lido is the cemetery of the Jews. The graves are covered with sand and vegetation, and children never hesitate to dance on them, - in fact, to do so is a favourite pastime. If one remonstrates, they will look at you with wide-open eyes, and explain that these are only graves of Jews, - a Jew with the Venetians being no better than a dog. The grave of a Christian is treated with the greatest reverence: even the children and the gondoliers salute it as they pass. There is something pathetic about the Jewish graves, from the stones over which the inscriptions have been effaced. Chioggia is one of the greater islands. It has a large town with an immensely broad street and a wide canal. Here is the most famous and most picturesque fish-market of all suburban Venice. In it one comes across the finest Venetian types, magnificent models for painters, bronzed Giorgione figures and black-eyed swarthy women. Their dialect is beautiful, far more so than that of Venice proper; and at night Ariosto is read publicly in the streets by a musical sweet-voiced Chiozzotto. Here the dramatist Goldoni lived, and the painter Rosalba Carrera, and the composer Giuseppe Zarlino. Chioggia reminds one of the Jewish quarter in the east end of London. The people, mostly fishermen, are extremely poor. This is the place for colour. There is colour everywhere - in the sails of the boats, in the costume of the people, and even in the red cotton curtains of the churches. Unfortunately, one's stay there was brief - because of the insects. A fisherman in Chioggia took us for a sail. We had bargained for an hour's journey; but we had not been out for more than ten minutes before he landed us on the rocks and demanded five francs. We were entirely at his mercy, and were forced to concede; but his action struck us as being high-handed. Sometimes the fishermen of Chioggia, if they are so inclined, will tell you tales of Angelica and Orlando, and the pageant of the Carolingian myth. Torcello is one of the most interesting islands of the lagoon. It is seven miles from Venice, and a pathway is made to it through the sea by stakes. The island is for the most part a waste of wild sea moor. Grey and lifeless in colour, it is a desolate place, and you feel as if you were at the end of the world. At one time it was extremely populous; but now it is impossible to live there, because the marshes breed malaria. Any count whose title and estates the Venetians deem improbable they call \\\"the count from Torcello.\\\" One passes six miles of the most beautiful scenery on the way thither. The entrance is by a canal, and the banks on either side are covered with dwarf bushes and lilac trees. Thirteen hundred years ago the grey moorland looked much as it does now - except that where a city stood the cattle feed, what was once the piazza of the city is a grassy meadow, and a narrow pathway is the only street. Two hundred years after the invasion of Attila, the inhabitants of Aquileia and Altinum, with their most precious possessions, flew from their houses to the island of Torcello. Now there is scarcely a sign of human habitation; and only the ruins of an old quay, an ancient well, foundations of marble buildings, a great church, and a campanile, are left to show what at one time was a populous city, which was called the mother of Venice. By the remains of these buildings one can see that they were constructed by men in great distress, seeking a shelter, yet not wishing to attract the eyes of their enemies by their splendour. The church of Torcello shows force and simplicity of character, and a certain reverent religious feeling on the part of its founders. Everything is on a small and humble scale. The columns which support the roof are no higher than a man. Yet these columns are of pure Greek marble, and the capitals are enriched with delicate sculpture. One sees everywhere in this church an earnest and simple desire to do honour to God in the temple they were erecting, and that it should not form too great a contrast to the churches they had loved and seen destroyed. Torcello is equally delightful in springtime and in autumn. In spring the orchards are in full bloom, and the hedges throw their pink and white sprays of thorn against the sky. In autumn the water meadows are a shimmer of purple and red from the masses of feathery lavender that grow there. It has much the same colour and feeling as a Scotch moor. Torcello is interesting from its venerable traditions, its desolation, its wildness, and its profound silence. There are many expeditions on which one could go if one had the time to spare. For example, there is an island near Torcello called San Francisco in Deserto. The name is well applied: St. Francis' island certainly stands in a desert. There is still an islet monastery of the Franciscan order. The brethren show you with much enthusiasm a stone coffin in which the founder of the convent was in the habit of lying in order to acclimatise himself to the sensation of death. Also there is pointed out a penitential cell which was once inhabited by the saint, and a tree (said to have sprung from his staff) which he planted. This legend may sound mythical; but perhaps it may not be so. It is quite possible for a staff, even if it has lain by for some time, to shoot out in several places in green sprigs; and one of these, cut in proper manner, might easily take root and grow into a tree. The real charm of the island lies in the garden of the monastery, where narcissus are abundant and there is a great avenue of cypresses, the finest in Venice. Triporti is different: in fact, no other island of the lagoon is quite like it. Here are great sweeps of sandy land covered with coarse grass and heather and pools of brackish water. The island is more or less uncultivated, and the air is full of strange aromatic odours from the sea. It is a marvellous place to bathe in: the sand is fine and soft and yellow, and the sea lies wide open before you, warm and limpid. If you have any doubt as to where Murano is, look for a great black cloud hovering over an island; and you may be sure that there are the glass factories of Murano. Glass-making is the only industry now practised in the lagoon. The factories are no longer numerous, Murano having declined from her ancient splendour. The secret of the magician is exposed; and Murano has no longer the monopoly of bevelled mirrors, great glasses, and crystal balls. Such work is executed in Birmingham quite as well as in Murano. The old art is lost. Still, Murano is interesting. There is perhaps more life in it than in any other of the islands. Workmen sift glass upon the pavement; women, at the doors, sit busily knitting, or stringing beads; fishermen, clothed in a dark greenish grey, are disentangling their nets, which hang over the boats in apparently inextricable confusion; there are street vendors of all kinds, calling out the nature of their wares to the passerby. There are five thousand inhabitants in the city of Murano. Its grand canal is almost as broad as that of Venice. The beautiful palaces, with their doors and windows of marble, - some of red Verona marble, some deeply enriched with mouldings, others with arcades of a singular grace and delicacy - are now inhabited by the very poorest of the poor. The church of San Donato, the Matrice or mother church of Murano, stands in a field of fresh green grass. It is said that a virgin appeared in a vision to its founder, Otho the Great, showing him this very meadow overgrown with scarlet lilies, and bidding him erect a church there in her honour. Murano, on the whole, is a dreary little town. Wealth, beauty, and elegance have passed away; the country is devoted to cabbages and potato patches. Still, it has charm even in its decay. How beautiful Murano must have been at the time when Cardinal Bembo and so many famous literati lived there! It must have been an earthly paradise, with its luxurious vegetation, lordly palaces, and magnificent gardens. In this city the horse is a quaint and unexpected animal. He is not wanted. He is quite as ridiculous and useless as a unicorn would be in the streets of London. He annoys one, this strange beast, - making one think of mountains, valleys, fields, trees, streets, and carriages, at a time when one is eager to be satisfied with sparkling lagoons, gondolas, and a palace for hotel. The gardens in Venice have a character all their own. They are highly prized, for space is scarce. The soil is rich, formed of lagoon mud; but only certain plants will grow freely in it - because of the salt air. The variety that will bloom, however, is quite enough to make a good show - flowering and aromatic shrubs, roses (especially banksia), most bulbs, and (blooming the finest and happiest of all in Venetian soil) carnations, the \\\"garofoli\\\" which play so large a part in Italian love-stories. On the Giudecca there are two gardens, each quite different from the other in character and appearance, but both illustrating what a Venetian garden may be like. In one all the resources of art and wealth have been brought to bear, and there is a succession of brilliant beds of colour. In the middle is a green oasis, a kind of English orchard, where the turf is as fine and as velvety, as deep and green, as that of any English lawn, and the orchard trees throw a delicate tracery of flickering shadows. There are beds of splendid colour, varying with the seasons. In fact, there is almost an Oriental lavishness about this garden: the scent of the flowers is almost oppressive. The other garden is not less beautiful; but it is set apart for profit rather than for pleasure. There are aisles upon aisles of vine-covered pergolas, crossing one another; and one can saunter down these cool promenades for hours, absolutely bareheaded. A narrow strip is divided from the rest of this garden by a thick hedge. Here, in one glorious mass, are all the flowers that will grow freely in Venice - the flame-coloured trumpets of the bigonici, by bowers of roses over-arching walks, banksias festooning the walls, and one corner completely filled by a splendid Daphne odorifera which by her perfume draws the butterflies. However, one cannot quite understand the spirit that prompted Alfred de Musset to write those verses the last of which runs: -  \\u00c0 Saint Blaise, \\u00e0 la Zuecca, Dans les pr\\u00e9s fleuris cuellir la verveine; \\u00c0 Saint Blaise, \\u00e0 la Zuecca, Vivre et mourrir l\\u00e0. There are now at Saint Blaise no pastoral and poetic places where lovers could stroll hand in hand by the pale moonlight: the gardens, somewhat marshy, are cultivated principally for market purposes. The Giudecca Canal is the commercial harbour of Venice. The churches of Redentore and Maggiore lie on the farther side of it. In this canal a group of small vessels lie all day long at anchor - twenty or thirty of them, laden with wood brought from the Istrian coast, and sold in Venice. When it has been disposed of, the captain calls his crew from the distant caf\\u00e9s and wine-shops, releases the watch-dog from his post on deck, weighs anchor, and creeps down the Adriatic to reload again with fuel. This is all the Venetian commerce of to-day - this and a few beads, glass, wood-carving, lace, and bric-\\u00e0-brac, such as would scarcely load a modern trading-ship. Nine hundred years ago the trade of Venice was important. By the close of the eleventh century, the city was commercially supreme in Europe. Yet she manufactured nothing. She was supreme simply by the exercise of the merchant's calling. She was Europe's greatest ship-owning power and commercial head. Her merchants, conveying cloth, velvet, serge, canvas, various precious and commercial metals, glass beads, and other goods, received in return drugs, spices, dyes, precious stones, rugs, silks, brocades, cotton, and perfumes, which were sold at a high rate of profit. The population of Venice was then two hundred thousand; the annual exports were valued at ten million ducats; there were three hundred sea-going vessels, eight thousand sailing vessels, three thousand smaller craft, seventeen thousand mercantile sailors, and a powerful navy with eleven thousand able-bodied seamen. San Giorgio is of note as the place for red mullet from the Adriatic. Nothing equals the fish: none other is so appetising, so red and fresh in colour - one would feel inclined to eat of it if only for its hue. The best place to procure mullet is in a certain tavern where gondoliers and sailors mostly congregate: here they can drink wine free of duty. The tavern is invariably filled with such men, all stretched out on benches round the table. San Giorgio is the place for sunsets also: from nowhere else in the lagoon can one see such a marvellous variety, such changes of sea and sky. The church possesses a wonderful Entombment by Tintoretto. San Servolo is a very small island beyond San Giorgio, yet one of the brightest jewels in the coronet of the lagoon - almost entirely covered with buildings. Burano has a population of some nine thousand. The people are chiefly engaged in fishing and in towing. One sees boatfuls of them returning from the sea; and lines of them towing heavy mud-filled barges on the way to Pordenone, all the men stepping in time with one another and bending to the rope with a will. There is something statuesque about these toilers. With their long, cleanly-moulded limbs, they remind one of ancient Egyptian bronzes. The sculptor would find plenty of scope in Burano. The people, however, are of evil repute by heredity. They are the scapegoats of the lagoon. If anything goes wrong, the blame is always laid upon them. They work harder and receive less pay than the inhabitants of any other island. In the old days terrible quarrels used to arise among the women, either in the market-place or when they sat in their doorways making that exquisite lace for which the town is famous. To the present day lace is made at Burano, and even now the women quarrel over their work. If one did not know the language, one would not imagine that they were quarrelling - the dialect is so soft and sweet, the words dying away in a kind of sigh. Mazzorbo is connected with Burano by a long wooden bridge. There are very few houses here, and very few inhabitants. The island is given up to flower gardens and the cultivation of fruit. Every day boats laden with fruit, to be sold at the Rialto, are sent to Venice. Most of the inhabitants of Mazzorbo are extraordinarily beautiful and sweet of nature. These characteristics are very often found among those whose business is chiefly connected with mother earth. Gardeners of all nationalities are generally gentle and charming persons. San Lazzaro is where the Armenian monks spend their quiet lives, happy in the study and culture of their gardens. This convent of theirs is a gem of colour set on the lagoon, painted a deep crimson and looking like some gorgeous tropical flower. There is a terraced walk in the garden, and the cloister is rich in flowers and planted with cypress and oleander trees. It is a place in which to bask in the sun, and watch the crabs fighting with one another on the sloping wall. One can see the sun setting behind the Euganian hills, and watch the first stars appear and the piazza lights shine out. Malamocco is not often visited by strangers; yet there is much that is beautiful in the place, and a certain old-world air that fascinates one. It is a good deal older than Venice; and its people, friendly and clean persons, are always careful to explain to you that they are not Venetians. The famous white asparagus, for which the evil-smelling mud makes excellent soil, grows plentifully in Malamocco. San Elena was once an exceedingly lovely island. It lies near to the city, and is only a short distance from the public gardens. The grave of Helen, mother of Constantine the Great, at once an empress and a saint, is said to have been here. There was also a very beautiful Gothic cloister. Now the old monastery walls have been pulled down, and a hideous iron factory has been erected; the quiet convent cemetery has been dug up, and the crosses have been thrown aside to make way for iron-girded workshops. For expeditions on the lagoons it is always well to choose a pearly, silvery-grey day, when everything is delicate in colour and mellowed by a semi-transparent haze. The lagoons are not always grey and calm. They have their moods. I have seen a fair green sea grow black beneath a sudden storm. Sometimes Venice will appear blue and rosy, the smooth sea as green as in Canaletto's pictures, the white cupolas of Santa Maria della Salute and the silver domes of St. Mark's standing out as on an azure background. Then great masses of grey clouds will come up, the sea is festooned with foam, and black gondolas skim over the water like swallows flying before a storm. Sometimes the sky is clear and the light vivid, the water shines like silver, and one cannot tell the horizon from the sea; the islands appear like brown specks, and the ships seem to be sailing in the sky. At others the sea, under an east wind, is cold and hard as steel. In winter the lagoons are wrapped in damp mists, so thick that, however good a navigator you may be, you must needs lose your way; steamers and gondolas loom out and then disappear, swallowed up by the dense wall of vapour, and the shipping looks ghostly, tall and gaunt. Away out in the remote and unfrequented regions of the lagoon are small isolated huts, mud-plastered, single-roomed cabins, built on piles, which guard certain valli, to which the fish are driven in the spring, to spawn. These consist of deep ditches surrounded by palisades of wattled cane. Here the men stay sometimes for days, fishing with nets, or standing upright in the long light boats waiting for their prey. Some of the valli have the most uncanny names: one is \\\"The Val dell' Inferno,\\\" and another \\\"The Val dei Sette Morte.\\\" Of this last there is a terrible story, which has taken deep root in the imagination of the people. Six fishermen were living in a valle. They had with them a boy, who, when they went out on the lagoon, stayed at home to cook for the men. One day, when they were returning with their boatload, they found the body of a drowned man floating out to sea. They picked the body up and laid it on the prow. The boy came to meet them, crying that breakfast was ready. When they were seated at their meal he asked why they had not brought the man who was lying in the prow. The fishermen said, jokingly, that he had better go and call him. This the child did, but soon returned with the news that he had shouted to the man in the prow, who had neither moved nor answered him. \\\"Go again,\\\" said the men. \\\"He is a deaf old fool. You must shout and swear at him.\\\" The child went once more to the boat, and shouted and swore at the man; but still he would not wake. \\\"Go out again and shake him by the leg, and tell him that we can't wait until doomsday for him,\\\" said the fishermen. So the boy went, climbed into the boat, and shook the man by the leg. This time the man in the prow sat up and said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" \\\"Why don't you come?\\\" asked the boy. \\\"They can't wait until doomsday for you.\\\" \\\"Go back,\\\" he said, \\\"and tell them I am coming.\\\" The boy went back to the hut, and told the men, who were laughing and joking over their meal, that it was all right: the man in the prow was coming. At this the fishermen turned very pale and laughed no more. Then they heard heavy footsteps coming slowly up the path; the door was pushed open; the dead man came in, and sat down in the boy's place, making seven at the table. The eyes of the other six were fixed on the seventh, their guest. They could neither move nor speak. The blood grew colder and colder in their veins. When the sun rose and shone in at the window, it shone on seven dead men sitting round the table in the valle. Despite this tale, Venetian people are bright and essentially practical. They are not deeply imaginative. Horrors, weird fancies, and love of the preternatural are quite foreign to the Italian temperament. \\nSOCIAL UPS AND DOWNS A great change came over society in Venice early in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The people were dull, and sullen, and poor. They resented their political position bitterly. The feeling with which they were possessed was their great hatred of the Austrians. They did not hate the Austrians individually; but they did politically, and therefore socially. If you wanted to know the Austrians, you could not know the Venetians: if you were friendly with either, you must cold-shoulder the others. Society in Venice was divided into two distinct sections. Once gone over to a side, you had no withdrawal. If a girl intermarried she was cut off for life from her family. Whatever the Venetian can or cannot do, he can certainly hate, and that well. He may be dull and dispirited; but he is fiercely patriotic, and his hatred of the Austrian was very strong. Most of the nobility were exiled. The rest kept severely to themselves. They never attended popular festivities, and even among the poorer classes of Venetians very few old customs were kept up. The people felt keenly the contrast of what had been and what was. A bridge of boats was still built over the water to the church of the Redentore; but it was very little used. The carnival, which was wont to last for six weeks, was kept up but a single night; and then it was a farcical show. Only a few dressed-up beggars tore through the streets, singing songs at the caf\\u00e9s for drinks, and they were looked upon by the crowd with melancholy scorn. Venetian people of good family seldom went to the play or to the opera. Austrian bands played there. The places of entertainment were mostly kept up by foreigners, and were consequently not what they might have been. To find good Italian opera one had to go to London or to Paris. Still, the Venetians love music. It is born in them: they have a passion for the art which nothing can subdue. Even the veriest street urchin sings his gutter song with a fervour such as we do not know of in the north. Despite the ban from which they suffered, the theatres were not uninteresting. Scarcely any Italian can act badly. Practically in every case he has the dramatic instinct. But there was no gay buzz in the audience, no flitting from box to box. The theatres were filled with Austrians, who took their pleasure quietly. The artisans and other poor Venetians, who saved up their money to go to the play, certainly did enjoy it. They cheered and hissed with vehemence, and between the acts drank aniseed and water, and ate candied fruits on sticks fashioned at the ends into toothpicks. Marionette shows were very popular. The theatre was tiny, and the stage was tiny; everything was arranged in accordance with the small dimensions of the actors. The marionettes talked very volubly, so much so that it was sometimes difficult to follow them. The plays, written expressly for the marionettes, were of all descriptions, from melodrama to farce. Sometimes there were ballets. The audience was generally amusing. It consisted principally of boys. The hat was passed round, and if the proprietor considered that there was not sufficient money collected he would shout, \\\"O you sons of dogs!\\\" and close the theatre. If any Venetian of good family gave a ball or a party, he was looked upon with suspicion by the poor, who had no holidays, no tips, small trade, and large taxes. The Austrians gave balls and parties occasionally, but not very often. They hated Venice, where they were regarded as a pestilence, and shunned by all save their own countrymen. This strange antagonism continued for a few years, until the Austrian occupation ceased and Venice was united to the rest of Italy. The Emperor of Austria's birthday afforded a good example of the inter-racial bitterness. All night long Austrian bands paraded the streets, cannons were fired at intervals, and fireworks let off. It seemed as though by unnecessary ostentation of artillery the Austrians were endeavouring to reach the throne in Vienna. But a dead silence reigned in Venice. Not a single Venetian was abroad. The Austrians had their celebrations all to themselves. It was rather pathetic to see them trying to work up joy and enthusiasm. Next morning the celebrations were continued. Service was held in St. Mark's Church; and the soldiers stood outside in the square in long rows, drawn to attention, the sun shining on their resplendent uniforms and handsome faces - a gallant array! Not a single Venetian showed himself. Not a blind was drawn. Not one curious woman's face appeared at a window. Even a Venetian servant girl would not have exchanged a civility with an Austrian officer that day. There was a dreadful hush everywhere. Venice was like a dead city. One felt that the people were stuffing their ears, and covering their eyes, behind drawn blinds. The Austrians tried hard to be jubilant and gay; but very obviously they did not succeed. In the evening they went to the opera, endeavouring to spread out and make more of themselves; but the large house was practically empty. The day after that, Venetian life flowed back again into its accustomed channels. The people were laughing and chatting and filling all the eating-houses, as though making up for lost time. One wondered what the antagonism would all end in. There was in Venice a committee which looked after Venetian interests. On all the public anniversaries bombs were fired and flags were flown. In all the Government Departments the committee placed spies, who were so clever that they were seldom detected by the Austrians. Even in the cathedrals those men would sometimes explode bombs. The antagonism between the Venetian and the Austrian was shown in the piazza, perhaps, more than elsewhere. The military band played there three times a week, winter and summer, - played gloriously all the best Italian airs. Much as they loved music, the Venetians walked up and down the quay, or in the arcades. They would not enter the square until the music was finished. Such was their pride! The caf\\u00e9s had no longer their gay and lively reputation. Only at Florian's did the Austrians and the Venetians sometimes intermingle - and that was because of the foreigners. Usually the Venetians had their separate caf\\u00e9s, and the Austrians theirs - the Quadri and the Specchi. The piazza of St. Mark's seems to be the very heart of Venice, the very core, from which everything radiates, only to return. If you lose yourself in Venice, and go on walking, you will be sure to find your way back to the piazza sooner or later. At eight o'clock the piazza was at its very gayest. Nothing could be more lively, more amusing. It was lined with caf\\u00e9s - the caf\\u00e9s \\\"Suttil,\\\" \\\"Quadri,\\\" \\\"Costanza,\\\" and \\\"Florian\\\"; which last reminds one very much of the \\\"Caf\\u00e9 Royal\\\" in Paris, and was certainly quite as famous. The old proprietor of this restaurant was greatly patronised by the Venetian nobility, who were loud in their praises both of himself and of his viands. The first Florian lived in the time of the Empire. There is a charming story told of him and the artist Canova. The old hotel-keeper was very much troubled with gout, and Canova, to whom Florian had rendered many services, modelled the affected leg in plaster, in order that he might have a shoe made which would fit exactly, and so ease the pain. No doubt (but this is pure surmise) Florian favoured the artist, in return for his kindness, with a dish of his famous \\\"sorbet au raisins.\\\" Street vendors of all kinds swarmed in the piazza at night - flower-girls of the most obliging natures, who, if you would not buy their wares, would thrust a bouquet into your hand gratis (you were, of course, supposed to repay them at some other time). There were musicians of every sort and kind - some with guitars; others with mandolines; some playing selections from the operas; others singing \\\"Funiculi\\\" and \\\"Santa Lucia\\\" in high tenor voices; deep-chested, bronze-faced men who explained that they were once operatic stars, but were now reduced, by the injustice of managers and the villainous tempers of the prima donnas, to street singing. There were men who went about selling frosted fruits on long sticks, crying \\\"Caramel, caramel!\\\" and giving descriptions of their wares in almost every European language. People of all races were there - red-faced Englishmen and fair women, with their rosy daughters in sailor hats, on the way from Switzerland, the respectable English father explaining St. Mark's with a comprehensive wave of the hand. There were Frenchmen, Americans, Austrians, Italians, either talking volubly or deadly quiet; Greeks, with long bluish-black hair floating out behind them, and caps with silk top-knots (these were captains of small vessels coming from Cyprus and Syria, and they went to the Caf\\u00e9 della Costanza, where they could procure mocha and the pipe they loved best); and young Venetian gentlemen who spent their lives for the most part in drifting from one caf\\u00e9 to another, generally handsome, well-dressed men with immaculate linen and pointed beards carefully cut, carrying long canes, and the lightest of kid gloves (their main object seemed to be to stare at all the pretty women); and Austrians, smart, good-natured people, who frequented their own caf\\u00e9s, with much talk and laughter and rattling of swords. Now and then one saw Venetian women of the upper classes on the piazza, but very rarely. They were extremely indolent and lazy, and seldom went out. The weather, they would tell you, was never sufficiently fine: there was too much sun, or a sirocco was coming, or a cloud threatened rain: the slightest thing deterred them. Often the utmost exertion a Venetian woman would allow herself in the day was to pass from her sofa to her balcony to breathe the freshness of the flowers. Consequently, she had a complexion which was extremely delicate, a sort of pearly whiteness. Sometimes she would take a turn or two in the piazza with her husband or brother as cavalier, and languidly sip anise and water at the Caf\\u00e9 Florian. For the most part the ancient aristocracy of Venice lived in retirement and were very poor. They dwelt in palaces whose walls were covered with priceless paintings by great masters, with which they would not part. They dined off a dish of polenta or fried fish, which a valet brought from a tavern near by. Their poverty and the fear of spies and informers combined in making society in Venice extremely reserved. It was impossible for a stranger to penetrate into the midst. In summer, in the months of the dog-star, those few among the patricians who were well-to-do flew to their villas on the banks of the Brenta, on the mainland. They returned to Venice in winter, only because, they said, the odours from the lagoons at that time were unhealthy and caused fever. Those who had no country houses, and could not afford to travel, shut themselves up in their palaces and drew down their blinds until it was the fashionable time to appear. In the dead season there were no lamps lit in the great entrances, and the palaces were silent. The family lived in the back rooms on the top story. The rest of the house was let. Most of the palaces were built round courtyards, and the contessa might go thither as often as she pleased to interview tradesmen and bargain for fish - there at least she would be free from espionage. As a matter of fact, it was pleasant to be in Venice at that season. The heat was less: the sun did not bake the ground as it did on the mainland. Owing to the sirocco which blew across the water, the air was cool and sweet. Human beings, however, are ever the slaves of custom, and it was the fashion for Venetian noblemen to spend the summer months on the Brenta. The river scenery had a fascination for them, just as the Thames has for Londoners. All along the banks were rows of little, bright, stuccoed villas, somewhat flimsy, each with its patch of garden and its shrubbery at the back, where the family sat all day. Now and then one saw a nobleman's palace breaking the line of somewhat uninteresting houses. Such was the magnificent villa at Stra, belonging to a princely Venetian family, with its great sweeps of green lawns, its orangeries, its alleys, and quaintly cut yews. Venetians love nature when it has been trimmed by man. Certainly the banks of the Brenta are very beautiful, especially in spring, when the water is covered with lilies of yellow and white, and the banks are lined with scented flags, and the larks tip the surface of the water with violet wings and sing as they mount against the sun. It is not unlike the scenery of some quiet English stream. This custom of spending the summer months in the suburbs of Venice was called \\\"villeggiatura.\\\" It was one of the gayest times of the year for the Venetians. They lived by night. All day long they lay behind closed blinds, while the sun parched and baked the ground. Only from five o'clock in the afternoon until four in the morning could they be said to live. Then they held dances, card-parties, and flirtations. During these hours, when the temperature was low, amusement and pleasure reigned supreme; but no sooner did the sun begin to rise than, as surely as Cinderella disappeared at the stroke of twelve, the gay society of the Brenta vanished, and the place lay dead and silent once more under the intolerable glare. How different society in Venice was in the early days! Then the houses were marvels of luxury; the finest wit, the most brilliant conversation, and the most delightful music were to be heard in Venice. It was not in the houses of the old aristocracy that the most brilliant people - painters, writers, poets, and politicians - assembled. It was in the houses of women who were looked upon as more or less shady persons, whom no Venetian gentleman would dream of introducing to his wife. The wives of the aristocracy were seldom seen except at public functions. They took much the same position in society as the \\\"honoured interior\\\" takes in Japan at the present day. (The geisha, although she is infinitely more entertaining, has no social status whatever.) The Venetian lady of quality, unlike the \\\"honoured interior,\\\" dressed in the most magnificent style. In the estimate of her husband nothing was too gorgeous or too costly for her to wear. Among all those of the larger towns of northern Italy, Venetian women of the sixteenth century were the first to wear needle-point. Although the ideal woman of that time had to be tall, a Venetian mother never troubled herself about the height of her daughter. At any moment she could transform the girl's dwarfish stature to that of a splendid giantess by the use of a pair of high pattens, which were unnoticed beneath the long stiff dress. Neither was the colour of the hair a source of inconvenience. Should a girl's locks be of a mousey nondescript shade, her mother, instead of using injurious dyes, made her daughter sit every day for three hours in the front balcony where the sun shone the brightest, dressed in a crownless hat, so that her tresses might be pulled through it, and a very broad brim, in order that her face should not be tanned. Then the damsel's maid would sit and comb her mistress's hair, bleaching in the sun. Girls were never dressed so richly as their mothers. In fact, the uniform dress was very simple, generally plain black or white. When they went to church they wore long white veils, or falzulo, and on ordinary occasions long gauzy silk ones, through which they could see, yet not be seen. On her marriage day the girl was first introduced into society, and saw the bridegroom for the first time. After marriage the rules which ordered her life were not nearly so restricting. In 1614 certain regulations were passed with regard to dress and household extravagances - the amount of money to be spent on dress, liveries, gondolas, jewellery, feasts and entertainments, gold and silver plate, and even the dishes and the menus of dinner-parties. All these were limited. The earliest nobility consisted of twenty-four families who ruled as tribunes over the twelve islands of the lagoons that formed the Venetian State. Some of these families are still represented in Venice. In the year 1296 a rigid and definite aristocracy was formed. Those who held chief places in the management of the State, whether they were noble or they had gained importance through their riches, determined to establish themselves as the permanent rulers of Venice, and to close the doors of office against all parvenus. Thenceforward only near relations of those who sat in the Great Council could be recognised as members of the caste. The twenty-four families, nevertheless, had distinction, and were called the \\\"old houses.\\\" Admission to the Venetian nobility was rarely conferred on anyone save foreign princes or distinguished generals. Now and then, when the State was sorely in need of money, a Venetian family was ennobled; but for the most part the aristocracy guarded their privileges most zealously. In the days of her decadence, in the eighteenth century, the tightly-laced, lackadaisical men and the hooped and brocaded women of Venetian society lived a curious, aimless, artificial life. Their greatest pleasure seems to have lain in gossiping, eating, drinking, and generally struggling to kill time. It was an inane life, frigid, without freedom, without heart, without strong emotion. All pleasures seem to have been carried out by rule. Even the laughter and the jokes were artificial. There can be but small wonder that society fell into broken fortunes. The ideal nobleman of to-day is a stronger, more active, finer person altogether than his senatorial ancestor. His character is healthier. He adopts more or less a country life. He owns property on the mainland, and is very much occupied in trying to make it pay. He rears cattle, grows crops, makes wine on his own premises, is interested in silk-growing and in model farms, and competes for agricultural prizes offered by the Government. His Venetian palace does not interest him greatly. He spends a few months there in the season, gives one or two large entertainments, and is constantly making alterations and improvements; but his heart is in the country, and he leaves Venice for his rural palazzo on the slightest pretext. This Venetian noble of to-day thinks a great deal of himself. His temper is haughty, and there is no softness or geniality about him. Nevertheless, he is a decided improvement. What society there is still to be found in Venice is constituted by foreigners, mainly English and American. One of the great things to be done is to take a gondola and go to the Canal of the Slaves, beyond the public gardens on the island of St. Peter - to the home of an old fisherman celebrated for his fish dinners. This fisherman's cottage is just as celebrated in Venice as the Trafalgar Hotel in London, or the Ship Tavern at Greenwich, or La Rap\\u00e9e in Paris. Here, however, is a more picturesque environment - boats drawn up on the yellow sand, nets stretched to dry in the sun, planks forming a landing-place in front of the houses - all is very simple. One eats the fish dinner in a garden, under an arbour shaded by vines, where flowers and edible vegetables grow in charming but ill-kept confusion. The host is jovial; his wife, a great authority, is the cheerful mother of many children. One finds on one's travels that each city has its local and peculiar dish - Marseilles its \\\"bouille \\u00e0 baisse\\\"; Venice its \\\"soupe au pidocchi\\\" - mussels, gathered in the lagoons and canals, flavoured with spices and aromatic herbs. Personally, I would rather this Venetian viand were not so classical; but you would touch the people to the quick if you refused their offering. After it come oysters from the arsenal, eels and mullet from Chioggia, fried sardines, white wine of Policella, and fruits from the hills of Este, Marselice, and Montagnana. At the end of the repast one is presented with a bouquet from the garden. \\n\\nGONDOLAS AND GONDOLIERS\\n\\nNo conveyance in this world is more delightful than the gondola. In appearance it is undoubtedly the most beautiful vessel in the world. Like most characteristic objects appertaining to Venice, it is suitable to the place: in fact, it is the outcome of the place. There is nothing strange or unnatural about Venice. Everything there seems to have come about through force of necessity, and is therefore perfectly beautiful. Even as the hansom cab suits London, or the 'rickshaw suits Japan, or the jaunting-car suits Ireland, so the gondola is the vessel for Venice. You cannot separate the lagoon from the gondola. One completes the other. Without either Venice would be impossible. The gondola alone can wend its way through the intricate water-streets of the Queen of the Adriatic. There is no indication of movement whatever in a gondola. The craft has no springs, no cogs, no jarring wheels or oily machinery, no vibration. Simply one sees the palaces glide by in front of one, and hears the water making a lapping noise under the bows. The gondolier is out of sight. Nothing blocks your view of sea and sky, save the slender steel ferro at the prow. The gondola is built for leisure: one cannot quite imagine it, let us say, in America. It is a historic vessel, with a flavour of sentiment and antiquity about it, built by a leisured people for idleness, not for business or for hurry. It is long and slender, flat-bottomed, and tapers towards each end, where it rises considerably above the water. It draws but little water, and has much the form of a skate. The felce (cabin), placed somewhat astern, is draped with black cloth, which can be removed in the summer-time to make room for a striped awning. This, however, the true Venetian loathes: rather than use it, I am sure, he would be willing to swelter under the felce. On each side of the cabin there is a window, which can be closed in three separate ways - by a bevelled Venetian glass let down; by a blind with movable blades; by a strip of cloth dropped over. The gondola is made to hold four people. There are morocco cushions on either side. As the seats are very low, you are supplied with two silken cords with handles, to assist you to rise. As the cabin is too small to turn in, one must enter a gondola backwards. The woodwork is carved according to the wealth of the owner or the taste of the gondolier. Sometimes it is very elaborate. Above the door is generally a copper shield on which the coat-of-arms of the owner is engraved, surmounted by a crown; on the felce there hangs, in a small frame, an image of the Holy Virgin, or of St. Mark, or of St. Theodore, or of St. George, or of some saint for whom the gondolier has a special devotion. The lantern also hangs here - a custom which, as the gondolas sometimes run without the star in front, is gradually dying out. On account of the coat-of-arms, the saint, and the lantern, the left is the place of honour: there the ladies are placed, or any aged or distinguished person. There is in the felce a sliding panel, through which one can communicate with the gondolier on emergency. At the prow there is a halberd-like piece of iron, smooth and polished, called \\\"the ferro,\\\" much like the finger-board of a violin. This serves for decoration, for defence, for counterpoise to the rower in the stern, and to test the height of the bridges. It is the pride of the gondolier to keep this always as bright as silver. Often when a crowd of gondolas are moored thickly about the landing-stage, the ferro is used as a wedge, by the aid of which boats can be divided. The rower plies his oar standing on a small platform on the poop, not far behind the cabin, and facing the direction in which the gondola is to move. The skill with which the gondolier manages his graceful craft is extraordinary. He stands quite upright on the poop, one foot placed firmly in front of him, and throws the weight of his body forward on his oar to such an extent that one fears he may follow it into the water. It is only by long habit that he can procure the necessary balance. The gondola is sensitive to the least impression, and the downward stroke has the effect of sending the boat round. It is only by turning the blade in the water, and raising it gradually upward, that the gondola can be kept straight. The oar rests in a fork, beautifully designed to allow free movement. The gondolier, sole director of his craft, uses the oar sometimes as a paddle, and sometimes as a boathook. He rows always on one side. Under the hands of an efficient man, the gondola glides over the water like a living thing, turning the corners of canals with great precision. Sometimes on festa days the gondoliers practise feats, such as setting the vessel full-tilt and with all their might against the stone wall of a quay, going with such rapidity that you expect man and boat to be dashed to pieces. Just at the last moment, with a powerful turn of the oar that is interesting to watch, he stops dead at the base of the quay, sometimes nearly grazing it. In much the same way, in the At Maidan of Constantinople, long ago, Arab and Turkish horsemen charged against stone walls and suddenly pulled up. Very different is the gondola in the hands of an amateur. Many are the duckings that ensue. Some of the young patricians, however, occasionally don the traditional jacket, cap, and girdle of a gondolier, and guide their own craft in a remarkably graceful manner. Few people have any knowledge of the real meanings of the gondoliers' cries, some of which are peculiarly sweet and characteristic. When a man wants to pass on the left, and does not intend to use the backward stroke, he cries, \\\"Premi!\\\" If, on the other hand, he wishes to pass on the right, he cries, \\\"Stali!\\\" Sometimes, if when turning a dangerous corner he wishes to be especially emphatic, he cries, \\\"Premi! Premi!\\\" and \\\"Stali! ah, Stali!\\\" The gondola can be stopped immediately, however great the rate at which it is travelling, by placing the blade in front of the fork. If a man is really expert he stops his gondola very suddenly, making a great deal of foam with his oar. When stopping a gondola thus the gondolier cries, \\\"Sciar!\\\" As you approach the landing-stage a crowd of ragamuffins, old and young, called \\\"crab-catchers,\\\" come forward, holding in their hands staffs, with bent nails attached, with which to secure your gondola as you place your foot on shore. The gondolier is a voluble, gossiping person. He loves to have a chat at the top of his voice with another of his kind, and to scream repartee across the water. He enjoys nothing more than a quarrel, especially with a man who is across the canal. Invariably they pass from pertinent observations on their personal appearances to defamation of their women. If such language were used at close quarters on either bank they would come to blows. I once saw two gondolas hook on to each other by mistake with their iron axes, and I shall never forget the discussion that ensued. It made one's blood literally curdle! The men looked like two angry sea-birds pecking at each other as they pulled and pulled in their endeavour to release themselves. When this had been accomplished they stood upright, each on his own poop, brandishing their oars as though they longed to kill. As a matter of fact, there is rarely any violence among Venetians except in language. \\\"Body of Bacchus!\\\" one shouts. \\\"Blood of David!\\\" the adversary answers. These mythological oaths being not sufficiently comforting, they continue: \\\"Low crab!\\\" \\\"Sea-lion!\\\" \\\"Dog!\\\" \\\"Son of a cow!\\\" \\\"Ass!\\\" \\\"Son of a sow!\\\" \\\"Assassin!\\\" \\\"Ruffian!\\\" \\\"Spy!\\\" Having reached the worst taunt in their vocabulary, they take to cursing the rival saints. \\\"The Madonna of thy landing is a street-walker who is not worth two candles!\\\" one will cry. \\\"Thy saint is a rascal who does not know how to make a decent miracle!\\\" the other will rejoin. The profanity becomes more terrible as the distance between them increases. Possibly next time they meet they will drink a glass of wine together without remembering the quarrel. The gondolier is a more intelligent person than the ordinary hackman. He knows all the histories of the different places of interest, and relates them for the benefit of foreigners. He has a few words of French and English. Of course, he is a rogue by nature, and will cheat you on every possible occasion; but that conduct is common to the carriers of all countries. And there is something very frank and amusing about the way in which they commit their petty thefts. A gondolier likes to serve Englishmen or Americans, who pay good prices; but a German is beyond his comprehension. The Teuton either goes by the tariff or walks - an eminently foolish act, in the gondolier's opinion. Every gondolier belongs to a traghetto (ferry-boat station), from which gondolas cross over to Venice from various points on the Giudecca. These traghette have been established for centuries - no one knows exactly how long; but certainly they were in existence in the fourteenth century. To a gondolier a traghetto is, as it were, a club. There are sixteen traghette. Each is governed by its own laws and constitutions, which are still strictly kept; each has its own history, archives, and parchment documents. By this society are regulated the gondolier's wages, the limits of his obedience, his holidays, everything appertaining to his welfare. There is at each traghetto a little house in which the gondoliers can sit and gossip and mend their boats. One sees some of the finest types there. Years ago they used to sing there on moonlight nights, in their beautiful broken Venetian patois, verses from Tasso. It is long since they have done this as a habit; but they will do it sometimes if you pay them sufficiently well. One often hears them singing on the lagoon to the accompaniment of an Englishman's golden coins. You can almost imagine on such occasions that you are living away back in the Middle Ages - except that now the Venetians drink a good deal, as they certainly never did then, and sing in thick, guttural voices, somewhat hoarse, but on the whole beautiful, as the musical Venetian dialect must always be. The songs that they sing are all about lovely maidens and romantic excursions on the water. The singing is very fine from a distance, the melody of a human voice floating out on the calm and silence of the night. The gondoliers are proud of their talent, and value it highly. Nearly every gondolier belongs to a bank. He is a capable financier. In company with twenty-nine other men, he deposits 10 lire, and pledges to pay a weekly sum of 1 lira throughout the year. On his failing to pay up once a week, 10 per cent. on each lira is charged. Gondoliers are supposed to borrow a certain amount, for which 10 per cent. is charged, every year. The accounts of the bank are settled in September, and then a new venture is started. The gondolier is an inflammable person. He is much taken up with pretty women getting in and out of gondolas. Love-making with him begins on the bridges in the narrow canals, or at the windows. One fine day, generally very early in life, when propelling his boat slowly down a side canal, he sees at an iron grated window the face of a girl. Instantly becoming enamoured, boldly he takes up his position every day underneath her casement, waiting for a look, sighing for a smile. If by chance the maiden should appear and return his salute, he takes himself off with great joy; and at the end of the day, when his work is done, he and a friend in whom he has confided dress themselves in their best, and call upon the father of the girl, formally to ask her hand. He states his family, his profession, the amount of his income, and the extent of his love. Two or three months are allowed to elapse. Then there will be more gazing at the window and meeting in the calle. If by the end of that time their affection has declared itself sincere, the lover and his parents are invited to supper at the girl's home. Every stage in a Venetian's love affair is marked by feasts, generally suppers. On this occasion the young man again asks the father's consent. This is accorded him, and the pair are blessed. The ceremony is called the \\\"dimanda.\\\" A little later comes the betrothal (\\\"segno\\\"), when the lover presents the girl with her wedding ring, and, if he can afford it, other rings as well. There is a sumptuous supper, and thenceforward they are called respectively \\\"novizza\\\" and \\\"spoza.\\\" During the time of the betrothal the poor gondolier is kept very busy buying and giving presents to the lady of his choice. He must give the proper things at the proper times, and never by any chance make the mistake of purchasing a comb or scissors, for one is an emblem of the witch, and the other signify a cutting tongue. He must remember to present to her at Christmas a confitura of fruit and raw mustard-seed, and a box of mandolato; on All Souls' Day a box of fare; at the Feast of St. Mark a boccolo or button-hole of rosebuds; at Easter a fugazza or cake; at Martinmas roast chestnuts. The thing for the girl to give in return is a silk handkerchief: it is not considered etiquette to present her lover with a gift of great value. In Venice everything is ruled by custom. The most important acts in a Venetian's life are bound and fettered by it, and he would never dream of breaking through. He will sacrifice anything for custom, and never count the cost. For example, if one saw a gondolier at a festa, or at a baptism, or at a wedding, you might take him for either a rich man or a spendthrift. As a matter of fact, he is neither the one nor the other. Only, he is bound by custom to do certain things and spend a certain amount of money at a festa, and he does it regally. He may have to pinch and scrape at home afterwards; but that is another matter. The gondoliers are a very conservative people. They are the slaves of custom. Custom is to them a religion. They much prefer their ancient customs to any new order of comfort or convenience. Their lives are simple, bright, and easy; their wants are very few and moderate. House-rent is cheap: they can procure a fallen palace in moderately good repair for half a franc a day. They are frugal and easily pleased; their constitutions are sound; their climate is fine, and the air they breathe is pure. Consequently, the gondolier can live happily, with his wife, on a franc and a half a day. His meals, to be sure, are always the same - coffee and bread in the morning, polenta and fish at mid-day, a soup of shell-fish or artichokes at night. When the family begins to be large, the gondolier's life is not ideal; still, in spite of the hunger and poverty and crowding in Venetian houses, a great deal of joy manages to find room. If a baby lives, he grows up into a fine healthy man, robust and happy; but usually he dies, especially if he is one of many. Venetian women seem to have naturally not the slightest idea how to bring up a baby. It is only after constant habit and practice, and the loss of lives, that a mother seems to grasp the first principles of a baby's upbringing. Before that she will feed it, at two months old, on black coffee, sour apples, and wine; allow it to swallow all kinds of lotions and concoctions prepared by the doting old crones of the quarter. As the child grows older she lets it wear during winter the clothes which it wore in summer. Then she wonders why out of eight children only four are living. It is a beautiful sight to see a great gondolier nursing his little child. He may be harsh and bullying to his fellows; but he treats Baby with the utmost tenderness and gentleness. The child is a good deal safer in his arms than in those of the mother. The chief amusements of the gondolier are to go to the opera or to see marionettes, to make up a party and spend the day in the country, to compete in a rowing match, and to give a little supper at a wine-shop. It is on such days as these that the true freshness and warmth of his nature appear, and one sees the gondolier as he is - mirthful, pungent, gay. There are two things about which the gondolier is particular. One is his bread, and the other is his wine. One seldom finds good wine in Venice. It is only when the red wine arrives fresh from Padua and Verona that it is good. Then everyone rushes to the wine-shops; for nothing spreads quicker than the reputation of a good wine, and everyone clamours for it. Very soon it becomes watery and sour. The white wine the gondoliers do not like at all. Of bread there are all kinds. One is expected to have a preference for a certain make, and there are many different makes. There are the Chioggian bread, the \\\"pane Commune,\\\" the \\\"pane col agid,\\\" and many others. Men of the gondolier class do not think a great deal of religion. That is reserved for women. Church-going is no longer a habit with the men. Still, whenever matters of ancient custom step in they invariably do their duty - as in events of domestic life, such as confirmations, - and the little chapel to the Madonna at each traghetto has always its flowers and its few candles placed there by the reverent hands of the gondoliers. Times were good for the gondoliers when Venice was rich and prosperous. Nowadays their gains are meagre, and they number hundreds where they numbered thousands in the old days. Noblemen kept six or seven gondolas, with attendant gondoliers, and, besides paying them an ample salary, on festa days allowed them to exact any payment they chose. If you are staying in Venice for any length of time, it is better to hire a gondola and gondolier by the month than by the day. One only pays five francs a day, and when off duty the youth makes an excellent servant in the house. He comes and knocks at your water-gate at a certain time every day; also he will wait at table, act as footman, take care of the children; in fact, he will do everything one wishes; and he pays the proprietor of the gondola, out of his own pocket, one franc a day. It is the ambition of every gondolier to serve an \\\"Inglese.\\\" They say that Venice is always silent; but I can vouch that it is not so. At night, if your lodgings are anywhere near a landing-place, you will find that it is very noisy indeed. The gondoliers sleep at their posts on the pedestals of the two columns as they sit waiting for a job, and they love their repose in the sunshine; but at night they become extremely lively, and keep up a perpetual disturbance of laughter, shouts, and songs until two o'clock in the morning. They sit on the marble steps, or on the ends of their gondolas; or they eat shell-fish and drink wine under the light of the lamps in the niches of the Madonnas at street corners; vagabonds from their beds in the street arise and join them. One sees on the lagoons gondolas of all kinds, carrying passengers of all kinds, and it is sometimes interesting to peep inside as they pass. There are official gondolas, with the Italian banner floating at their sterns, carrying some cold, stiff functionary in full-dress uniform, his breast covered with decorations. Another carries English people, phlegmatic tourists, to Chioggia; another, with lowered felce, hides lovers who are going to breakfast somewhere on the lagoon; yet another, a larger gondola, takes a family to the sea baths at the Lido. There is a red craft waiting at the foot of some steps; a red bier is brought out of a church by a red cortege, - it is a corpse, to be buried in a cemetery on an island on the way to Murano. (When anyone dies in Venice a notice is posted up on his house, and on the houses round about, stating the age, place of birth, and the illness of which he died; also saying that he has received the Sacrament and died a good Christian; prayers are asked for his soul.) There are gondolas in which are musical instruments of all kinds - violins of Cremona, cornets, mandolines, tambourines, - a complete orchestra. Quite a large flotilla of gondolas follow in its wake. One has fastened to the side a bluish monster splashing and making the water foam. That is a dolphin, a marine curiosity which is displayed by the proud possessors under all the balconies as they pass, collecting money in a hat. In order that it may be seen to advantage, the animal is kept half in the water and half out. If one is at all interested in gondolas - that is to say, in the making of them, - nothing could be more fascinating than to spend a few hours in a squero (building yard). Any gondolier will be pleased to take you there, for he is inordinately proud of his craft. The squeri are picturesque; but somehow one always associates them with pitch. The place reeks with it. Always in one corner there stands the pitch-pot, sending a stream of thick black smoke up into the air. Small boys prance around, looking like young imps among the smoke and blaze, and wave smearing brushes in their hands. Long lines of boats, like some strange fish out of water, are drawn up, waiting to be cleaned or mended. The bottom of a gondola has to be dried thoroughly and quickly before receiving its coat of melted tallow. This is done by lighting a blazing fire of reeds under the boat, the flames leaping high into the air. Volumes of smoke arise, roll up over the house-tops, and are swept away by the breeze. Boys dance a kind of war-dance round the flames. The art of gondola-building is exacting. Three qualities are absolutely necessary to the formation of a perfect craft. It must draw but little water; it must turn easily; and it must be rowable by one oarsman only. To secure this, the hull is built of light thin boards, and only a portion of the flat bottom rests upon the water. Thus the boat swings as on a pivot. Then, the gondola is not equally divided by a line drawn from stern to bow: in order that the rower may be balanced, there is more bottom on one side than on the other. The various woods of which a gondola is made must be chosen with great care. They must be well seasoned and without knots, for the planks are liable to warp and the knots to start. Once every twenty days in summer the gondolier forfeits his four lire and takes his gondola to the squero to be cleaned and scraped. Weeds rapidly collect at the bottom when the water is warm, and the deadly toredo bores holes through the planking. The gondola is hauled up high and dry, and a fire burnt underneath it. A whole day's earnings in the summer season is a great loss to the gondolier; but if he keeps his gondola in good condition it will last him for a considerable time, perhaps for five years, and, besides, when the bottom of the boat is kept clear of weeds and well greased the speed is greater. When a gondolier sells his craft it becomes a ferry-boat for five years, the woodwork slowly bowing and bending until it becomes a gobbo half buried in the water. Later it is sold for five lire, broken up, and burnt in the glass manufactories of Murano. The natural history of these objects and their gradual development through centuries would form a fascinating chapter. To gain some idea of what the gondola once was, it is as well to study the pictures of Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio in the Academy. There you will see Venetian nobles in their gondolas with their light Eastern rugs. The ferro was not then hatchet-shaped, with six teeth, as it is now, but a round club of metal. The rower was tall and graceful, standing on the poop in his parti-coloured hose and slashed doublet. One can see by these pictures what a great change the gondola has undergone. Those who have not been to Venice, and wish to know something of a gondola in its later stage, would do well to study the pictures of Guardi and Canaletto. Therein the gondola has not its old brilliant colouring; but what it has lost in colour it has gained in grace. Some of the gondoliers are most skilful in managing without either keel or rudder; like the Vikings of old, steering with an oar behind. A good man is devotedly attached to his gondola. He knows its character and peculiarities. To the initiated every gondola differs in a hundred details from its fellow, although they may all have apparently been built on the same model. A gondolier's skill in rowing depends largely upon his knowledge of his craft. One can generally gauge the efficiency of a man by the brightness of his ferro. The slightest spot of dew or rain upon it produces a spot of rust which takes weeks of constant rubbing to efface. There is a good deal of brass-work which has to be kept clean; the cushions must be brushed, and the paint scrubbed; and altogether a gondolier spends quite an hour and a half a day on the toilet of his craft, polishing, oiling, and scrubbing. His own person does not occupy nearly so much of his attention. The gondola is so closely connected with the life of the sea city that most of one's impressions of Venice are wound round and about it. It is not always safe out on the lagoon in a gondola. Often in summer or in autumn a gale will suddenly arise. Great masses of cloud will gather in the east, and gain upon you; they are curved into an arc by the pressure of the wind from behind, although upon the water there is scarcely enough breeze to fill a sail. These great billowy battalions, dark and angry, advance slowly, steadily; the water changes from a pale transparent to a pale sea-green as thick as jade. A feeling of oppression fills the air, a brooding stillness, for five minutes, while the storm-clouds gradually overtake you. Then comes a low humming noise like that of a threshing machine: it is the wind on the nearest island. You down sail and make for the first port in view. The hurricane leaps out from the city, striking the water and tearing it into foam, flinging the spray high in air. There is hurry and confusion in the sky; the thundery clouds are rent and riven; and through the gaps of dull-coloured vapour you see the steely blue of the storm-clouds boiling as in a cauldron; and far above all is blue sky and sunlight; a rainbow spans the lagoon. Then the whole tornado sweeps away south-westward. The sun sets, leaving the sky dark, but with flaming streamers; then night falls over all. There is lightning and storm away in the distance. The heavens assume their customary deep blue, and the breeze is fresh and cool. These summer storms are sometimes almost tropical in their fury; but they are quickly over. Their path is narrow - usually confined to one line on the lagoon; - but where they strike they leave devastation in their track. The Venetians love festas, and in the days of the city's wealth and pride the State lavished great sums and much care upon its entertainments. Certainly the natural capacities of the city gave splendid scope for great spectacles. It was a magnificent background, and seemed to invite display. The pictures of Bellini, Carpaccio, Veronese, and all the rest of the old Venetian masters, prove how deeply the people must have loved the pageants and State processions. With the collapse of the State these customs fell into disuse. For example, there was that wonderful old sport - how picturesque it must have been! - the battle on the bridge between the Nicolotti and the Castellani, rival factions of black and red. There also was the regatta (I am not sure if it continues) - a great spectacle that could not be surpassed by any in Europe. A race was rowed in light gondolas, smaller than those of ordinary use. The Grand Canal was crowded with boats of all sizes - sandolas, barche, barchette, tipos, cavaline, vigieri, bissoni, - there is no end to the variety of Venetian craft. The fa\\u00e7ades of the palaces fluttered with flags, tapestries, carpets, and curtains, - anything that would add to the general mass of colour. The balconies were filled with people; every window had its bevy of heads. Down below on the water the scene was brilliant. The course was kept by large twelve-oared boats, all decorated symbolically. One represented the Arctic regions, the rowers being dressed as polar bears, with blocks of ice for seats; another the tropical regions, with palms and gorgeous flowers. In the evening there was a serenade, starting from a point above the Rialto. The singers and the orchestra were placed on a barge decorated and lighted by many coloured lamps, and the music of Donizetti's \\\"A te, o cara\\\" filled the air. The object of every gondolier on an occasion of this kind was to get his padrone as near to the music as possible, whether he wanted it or not. The singers' barge, therefore, was surrounded by a solid mass of gondolas, which floated slowly down the canal together, getting denser as the canal narrowed to pass under the Rialto bridge. It was a fantastic scene - with the masses of Bengal lights, the rising moon, the gondolas swaying gently to the rhythm of the song and the sea, and the statuesque gondoliers, creatures of the sea, standing upright on the stern of their vessels, or, oars in hand and hair blown by the breeze, silhouetted against a background of deep-blue sky. The gondolier in Venice is an important person to the stranger. Half one's comfort depends on his worthiness or unworthiness. He is like the girl of childhood's fame \\\"who, if she was good, was very very good, but, if she was bad, was horrid.\\\" If you are the employer of an ideal gondolier you will find him thorough, ready-handed, and versatile. In passing rapidly through Venice one does not properly appreciate his worth. You must own him for some months before you discover that he will attach himself to you and identify himself with your interests in an almost feudal manner. He will save you an infinity of trouble, and repay your confidence with honesty. The gondolier usually prefers to have a foreigner for a master. The foreigner pays well, never grumbling at the full tariff of five lire a day: also, as the foreigner does not know the language or the place, the gondolier becomes of some importance in the eyes of his neighbours, who bid for his patronage. With a Venetian master he would be paid from three to five lire a day; the work would be harder, and the hours later. When the squerariola (gondola builders) have finished their work, the vessel will probably have cost three hundred lire. Even then the craft is not by any means complete. There are the steel ornaments and many other details to be bought and bargained for, - things not procurable at the squero. For the steel prow (ferro), which must have the edges of its teeth in one straight line, and in these days of hurried workmanship is not always to be found, one must seek in all the smithies in Venice. A good gondolier, however, will often possess a ferro, an heirloom, made of hand-wrought iron, not cast in mould, heavy and brittle, as are the new ferri, but light and pliant. A ferro of the good and ancient make, if properly cared for and not allowed to rust, will outlive many a gondola. For the sea-horses, the rude carvings, the pictured Madonnas, the rugs and the covering for the felce, - all, in fact, that helps to make the gondola the picturesque craft it is, - one must go to the various shops in Venice. Modern progress and modern ideas are rapidly sweeping away the ancient and hereditary profession of the gondolier. One feels that his life and that of the traghetto are drawing to a close - that soon they will be things of the past. What would the Grand Canal be like without its swiftly gliding gondola, black-hulled, black-roofed, - its most characteristic feature? What a terrible thing it will be when that exquisite art is forgotten, - when the Venetian can no longer judge the turn of a corner or balance himself on the poop, - when for the picturesque cries \\\"Stali!\\\" and \\\"Premi!\\\" will be substituted the clank and thud of the steamers' screws! When a company first began to run steamers from Venice to the railway station and public gardens, the gondoliers struck. For three whole days there were no gondolas running in Venice; the canals were full of tightly packed vessels, while their owners hung together in groups at the wine-shops, talking. A strange and scratch fleet of nondescript boats plied between Venice and the islands, and the expression of the gondoliers, as they leaned over the bridges and watched the amateur watermen struggling with their oars, was quite unique. On the second day a notice was posted up in every traghetto begging the men to return to their work, and not to bring dishonour on a profession which had always been such a source of pride to Venice. This had no effect. The gondoliers merely enlisted the services of a barrister, getting him to take a copy of their demand to the Company - that the offending steamers should be removed. That was impossible. The steamers were cheap and useful, and the gondoliers could not be allowed to dictate to the State. However, they were told that if they returned peaceably to their work something might be done for them. They persisted in their strike, until suddenly - no one ever knew why, or whence it came - a single gondola started running from one of the ferries. That broke the ice. The gondoliers rushed to their crafts and untied them. The strike was forgotten. The men's first thought was to find good custom. I have always felt that there was something touching in this hopeless struggle of the gondoliers against the modernity that is fast settling on and demoralising Venice. \\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"English\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
